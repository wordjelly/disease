CHAPTER 1

Primary immunodeﬁciency

Introduction
In general, immunodeﬁciencies are divided into those of the speciﬁc
immune system (e.g. T cells or B cells) or those of the innate or nonspeciﬁc immune system (e.g. complement and neutrophils). The age at
which the patient presents gives good but not absolute clues as to the type
of immune deﬁciency; for instance, severe combined immune deﬁciency
(SCID) will present within the ﬁrst 6 months of life. The type of infection
also gives excellent clues as to the nature of the underlying immune defect.
For example, recurrent meningococcal infection is a major feature of complement deﬁciency, while persistent respiratory syncytial virus infection in
a small baby should raise the question of SCID. Other associated features
also provide clues; for example, ataxia (unsteadiness on the feet) together
with bacterial infections suggests ataxia telangiectasia.
Immunodeﬁciencies can also be divided into primary (usually genetic)
and secondary, where the immune defect is caused by some other nonimmunological disease; for example, a glycogen storage disease that causes
a neutrophil defect, or a drug (e.g. phenytoin). Sometimes the distinction is
blurred; for example, the AIDS virus (HIV-1) infects CD4+ T lymphocytes
and macrophages and alters their functional capacity. This is usually
referred to as a secondary immunodeﬁciency, despite the ‘primary’ effect
on T cells (see Chapter 2 for a further discussion of secondary immunodeﬁciencies). There may be some overlap between groupings (e.g. adenosine
deaminase has its immunological effect through a metabolic abnormality
that is genetically determined). Some host defence disorders are covered
in Chapter 2 (e.g. cystic ﬁbrosis).
2 All patients with primary immunodeﬁciencies should be under the care
of an immunologist, who will be familiar with the range of complications.

Clinical features of immunodeﬁciency
Recurrent infections
There is no universally accepted deﬁnition of what constitutes ‘recurrent
infection’ and therefore it is difﬁcult to be categorical about who should
be investigated for immunodeﬁciency. The following should be used as
guidance.
• Two major or one major and recurrent minor in 1 year.
• Unusual organisms (Aspergillus, Pneumocystis).
• Unusual sites (liver abscess, osteomyelitis).
• Chronic infections (sinusitis).
• Structural damage (e.g. bronchiectasis).
• Other suspicious features.
A major infection is severe infection, usually requiring parenteral treatment in hospital, with objective evidence of infection (elevated CRP, positive culture). Minor infection is less severe and is usually treatable in the
community with oral therapy, but has objective evidence of infection.

Other features raising suspicion of an underlying
immunodeﬁciency
• Skin rash (atypical eczema): Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, hyper-IgE
syndrome, Omenn’s syndrome.
• Chronic diarrhoea: SCID, IPEX, antibody deﬁciencies.
• Failure to thrive: any immune deﬁciency in childhood.

CHAPTER 1

Primary immunodeﬁciency

• Hepatosplenomegaly: common variable immunodeﬁciency (CVID),
Omenn’s syndrome.
• Chronic osteomyelitis/deep-seated abscesses: chronic granulomatous
disease.
• Mouth ulceration (?cyclical): neutropenia.
• Autoimmunity: CVID, hyper-IgM syndrome.
• Family history.

Features associated with speciﬁc immunodeﬁciencies
Some features are diagnostic of particular immunodeﬁciencies.
• Ataxia: ataxia telangiectasia; PNP deﬁciency.
• Telangiectasia: ataxia telangiectasia.
• Short-limbed dwarﬁsm: X-linked immunodeﬁciency.
• Skeletal abnormalities: ribs in ADA deﬁciency.
• Cartilage-hair hypoplasia.
• Ectodermal dysplasia.
• Endocrinopathy (particularly with hypocalcaemia): chronic
mucocutaneous candidiasis.
• Partial albinism: Chediak-Higashi disease; Griscelli syndrome.
• Thrombocytopenia (particularly with small platelets): X-linked
thrombocytopenia; Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome.
• Eczema: Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome; hyper-IgE syndrome; Omenn’s
syndrome.
• Neonatal tetany: 22q11 deletion syndromes (DiGeorge).
• Severe bowel disease: IPEX
• Abnormal facies (leonine, ﬁsh-shaped mouth, low-set ears): hyper-IgE
(leonine); 22q11 deletion syndrome (ﬁsh-shaped mouth, low-set ears);
ICF syndrome (see ‘Other chromosomal instability disorders’, p.50.
• Mental retardation: 22q11 deletion syndromes, PNP deﬁciency; other
genetic immunodeﬁciencies.

Investigation of immunodeﬁciency
History
Must include the following.
• History of all infections: site, severity, need for antibiotics,
hospitalizations.
• Operations (grommets, lobectomies, etc.).
• Immunization history.
• Family history, especially for serious infections, unexplained sudden
deaths, diagnosed immunodeﬁciencies, and autoimmune diseases.
• Various organizations, including the Jeffrey Modell Foundation and the
European Society for Immunodeﬁciencies have produced guidelines
for non-specialists to encourage greater recognition of primary
immunodeﬁciencies.

LABORATORY INVESTIGATION

Examination
Particular features to pay attention to include the following.
• Weight and height (failure to thrive).
• Structural damage from infections (ears, sinuses, lungs).
• Autoimmune features: vitiligo; alopecia; goitre.
• Other suspicious/diagnostic features, as above.

Differential diagnosis
Formulate differential diagnoses in rank order and then investigate
appropriately.

Laboratory investigation
Use laboratory facilities wisely.
• Target investigations to differential diagnosis.
• Do not blanket screen.
• Ensure basic tests are done before exotic tests.
• Think whether tests will contribute to diagnosis or management. If
they will not, then do not do them!

B-cell function
Full evaluation of the humoral immune system requires that all the parts
are present and functioning. The latter usually requires in vivo test immunization, bearing in mind the caveat that no patient with suspected immunodeﬁciency should receive live vaccines. The following tests comprise a
full screen of humoral function.
• Serum immunoglobulins (be sure to use a low-level detection system
for IgA to conﬁrm absence).
• Serum and urine electrophoresis (evidence for bands and urinary loss).
• IgG subclasses.
• IgE.
• Antibacterial, antiviral antibodies (appropriate to immunization and
exposure history).
• Immunization responses (protein and polysaccharide antigens).
• Isohaemagglutinins (IgM, dependent on blood group).
• B-lymphocyte numbers (ﬂow cytometry); class-switch memory B cells
(CD27+/IgD-/IgM-).
• Pokeweed mitogen (PWM) and antigen-stimulated antibody
production in vitro (clinical indications limited).

T-cell function
Tests of T-cell function are less easy and less reliable than those for B cells,
where antibody provides a convenient read-out. ‘Normal’ ranges for in
vitro proliferation assays are quite wide: know your own laboratory ranges.
Use absolute cell counts, not percentages.
• T-cell numbers and surface phenotype.
• CD2, CD3, CD4, CD8, CD7, Tcr (αβ, γδ), CD40 and CD40L, MHC
class II; CD45RA and RO, CD27.
• CD40 ligand expression on activated T cells.

CHAPTER 1

Primary immunodeﬁciency

• T-cell proliferation to antigens, mitogens (OKT3, PHA, phorbol
myristate acetate (PMA), calcium ionophore, cytokines).
• T-cell cytokine production in vitro.
• In vivo skin (delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH)) testing: the Multitest
CMI is a convenient tool, but responses will depend on prior
exposure. It is not widely used.

Neutrophil function
Neutrophil function tests are not widely available, so if there is suspicion
of a neutrophil defect, specialist help should be sought. Interpretation is
difﬁcult and tests may be inﬂuenced by intercurrent infection and drug
therapy.
• Neutrophil markers (CD11a, CD11b, CD11c, CD18, CD15).
• Upregulation of neutrophil markers (PMA, fMLP).
• Oxidative metabolism (quantitative and qualitative nitroblue
tetrazolium reduction (NBT test); ﬂow cytometric determination of
oxidative burst).
• Phagocytosis.
• Bacterial killing (relevant organisms should be selected).
• Chemotaxis (difﬁcult to standardize, with wide normal range).

NK-cell function
This is an area of particular interest.
• NK-cell numbers by ﬂow cytometry (absolute counts).
• K562 killing assay (radioimmunoassay, ﬂow cytometry).
• Cytokine-stimulated killing (lymphokine-activated killer cell (LAK)
assay).
• Perforin, granule-release assays.

Complement assays
• Measurement of speciﬁc components.
• Functional assays (haemolytic assays).

Toll receptor assays
• Measurement of speciﬁc pathways.

Cytokine and interferon assays
• Measurement of speciﬁc components and receptors (see Chapter 20).

Genetic studies
Genetic studies form an essential part of the investigation and management of primary immunodeﬁciencies.
• Cytogenetics (deletions, translocations).
• Ig and Tcr gene rearrangements (clonality).
• X-linked gene studies.
• 22q11 microdeletions (FISH—ﬂuorescent in situ hybridization).
• Protein expression studies (SAP, btk).
• MHC studies.
• Prenatal diagnosis.

RARE ANTIBODY DEFICIENCY SYNDROMES

Other investigations
The use of other investigative procedures depends very much on the clinical state of the patient.
• Detection of autoimmunity:
• anti-red cell, platelet, neutrophil antibodies
• anti-endocrine autoimmunity (e.g. thyroid autoantibodies).
• Exclusion of secondary causes:
• renal disease, bowel disease (loss of immunoglobulins ±
lymphocytes)
• malignancy (lymph-node biopsy)
• nutritional deﬁciencies (zinc, B12, iron)
• drugs (cytotoxics, anticonvulsants).
• Detection of nodular lymphoid hyperplasia (CT scanning, barium
follow-through, endoscopy, biopsy).
• Lung function (including FEV1, FVC, transfer factor).
• Imaging studies (HR-CT lungs, CT sinuses).
• Direct isolation of pathogens: bacteria, fungal, and viral (serology is
usually unreliable—use PCR-based tests where culture is not possible).

Major B-lymphocyte disorders
• X-linked agammaglobulinaemia (Bruton’s agammaglobulinaemia, XLA).
• Common variable immunodeﬁciency (acquired
hypogammaglobulinaemia, CVID).
• Selective IgA deﬁciency.
• IgG subclass deﬁciency.
• Speciﬁc antibody deﬁciency with normal immunoglobulins.

Rare antibody deﬁciency syndromes
• X-linked hyper-IgM syndrome (HIGM-1); CD40-ligand deﬁciency.
• Autosomal hyper-IgM syndromes (HIGM-2-4):
• HIGM-2; autosomal recessive activation-induced cytidine deaminase
deﬁciency
• HIGM-3; autosomal recessive CD40 deﬁciency
• HIGM-4; similar to HIGM-2, molecularly undeﬁned
• HIGM due to uracil-DNA glycosylase (UNG) deﬁciency.
• X-linked hypogammaglobulinaemia with growth hormone deﬁciency.
• Selective IgM deﬁciency.
• X-linked lymphoproliferative syndrome (Duncan’s syndrome; XLPS).
• Hyper-IgE syndrome (Job’s syndrome).
• Selective IgE deﬁciency.
• Transient hypogammaglobulinaemia of infancy.
• Mu-chain deﬁciency.
• IgA (CD79a) deﬁciency.
• Igβ (CD79b) deﬁciency.
• BLNK deﬁciency.
• ICOS deﬁciency.

CD19 deﬁciency.

X-linked agammaglobulinaemia
(Bruton’s disease)
This was the ﬁrst immunodeﬁciency to be described (1952). It has an incidence of 1 in 100 000-200 000 and a prevalence of 1 in 10 000.

Cause
• Genetic disorder due to a mutations on the X chromosome affecting
the btk gene.
• btk codes for a tyrosine kinase involved in B-cell maturation.
• Defects in the gene prevent B-cell maturation from pro-B-cell to preB-cell.
• Gene is located at Xq21.3-22. Mutations include deletions and point
mutations, either conservative or leading to premature termination.X• Phenotype correlates poorly with genotype.
• Mild phenotypes occur with some limited B-cell development.
• New mutations are common, so a family history may be absent.
• The xid mutation in mice is similar, although some features differ.

Presentation
• Usually early in childhood, after 6 months of age, when maternal
antibody has largely disappeared.
• Recurrent infections of lungs and ears (children of this age don’t have
sinuses):
• Haemophilus inﬂuenzae and pneumococci (upper and lower
respiratory tract, meningitis)
• meningococcus (meningitis)
• staphylococci (septic arthritis)
• Giardia, Salmonella, and Campylobacter infections of the gut
• Rarely Pneumocystis.
• Milder phenotypes may present later.

Diagnosis—key features
• Early-onset bacterial infections in a male child with a family history.
• Family history often absent.
• Neutropenia very common at presentation but goes away with
treatment and is probably due to chronic bacterial sepsis.
• Failure to thrive and chronic diarrhoea common.

X-LINKED AGAMMAGLOBULINAEMIA (BRUTON’S DISEASE)

• Distinction of milder forms, with some B cells and low but not
absent IgG, from CVID is difﬁcult and relies on the demonstration of
abnormalities of the btk gene. Some patients previously classiﬁed as
CVID will turn out to be XLA.
• Speciﬁc antibody deﬁciency only reported with btk mutations.
• XLA may rarely be associated with growth hormone deﬁciency (and
short stature).
• Occasional females will be identiﬁed with the immunological features
of XLA.
• Differential diagnosis will include coeliac disease and cystic ﬁbrosis,
although the laboratory tests will rapidly identify antibody deﬁciency.

Immunology
In the complete forms the immunology is fairly distinctive.
• All immunoglobulins are absent or very low.
• B cells are low or absent.
• btk protein absent (conﬁrm with genetic studies where there is a good
history to exclude production of non-functional protein).
• Lymph nodes show no germinal centres; no tonsils; pre-B cells in bone
marrow (BM).
• T-cell numbers and function are normal.
• NK-cell numbers and function are normal.
Mild or incomplete variants may be difﬁcult to distinguish from CVID.
• Variable numbers of B cells including normal.
• Variable immunoglobulins.
• Poor/absent speciﬁc antibodies to polysaccharide antigens.

Complications
The major complications relate to delay in diagnosis.
• Structural lung damage (bronchiectasis, sinusitis). Inadequate therapy
will lead to progression of lung damage and the development of
chronic sinus damage.
• Chronic meningoencephalitis due to echoviruses and Coxsackieviruses
may cause a progressive and fatal dementing illness; there is often
muscle involvement, with a myositis and contractures. Diagnose by
viral culture of CSF or by PCR-based techniques. Antiviral pleconaril is
helpful (though not licensed by the US Food and Drug Administration).
This disease appears less often since the introduction of intravenous
immunoglobulin (IVIg) therapy as standard, but has not disappeared
completely.
• Ureaplasma/Mycoplasma septic arthritis. This is difﬁcult to diagnose
without special culture facilities. It is a highly destructive chronic
infection and requires prolonged treatment (6 months) with
tetracyclines ± erythromycin.
• Haemophilus conjunctivitis.
• Crohn's-like disease of intestines. Possible increased risk of colonic
cancer.
• Possible increase in malignancies (colorectal, gastric, squamous cell
lung).

11

12

CHAPTER 1

Primary immunodeﬁciency

Treatment
• IVIg should be started at the earliest opportunity (see Chapter 16) at a
dose of 200-600mg/kg/month given at intervals of 2-3 weeks. Longer
intervals do not give satisfactory replacement.
• Subcutaneous immunoglobulin given weekly (same total dose) is an
alternative.
• Trough IgG levels should be monitored regularly, with the aim
of maintaining a level well within the normal range (6-9g/dl).
Early institution of IVIg and adequate trough levels preclude the
development of bronchiectasis.
• Prompt antibiotic therapy (course of 10-14 days) for upper and lower
respiratory tract infections together with physiotherapy and postural
drainage if lung damage has already occurred. Ciproﬂoxacin is a
valuable antibiotic (though not licensed for small children). Use cystic
ﬁbrosis approach of zero tolerance to cough.
• Prophylactic azithromycin 3x/week 9 carbocisteine is valuable where
there is established bronchiectasis—teach postural drainage and
effective cough.
• As children get older and can comply, perform annual lung function
testing, including transfer factor.
• High resolution CT scanning (HR-CT) is useful for identifying
subclinical bronchiectasis, but imposes a signiﬁcant radiation burden
and should not be overused.
• Do not give oral poliovaccine as patients often fail to clear it, which
increases the risk of reversion to wild type, with consequent paralytic
disease.
• Genetic counselling of the patient and family once the genetic basis is
conﬁrmed. Identify and counsel carriers.
• Long-term immunological follow-up (plus additional specialist input as
required).

XLA with growth hormone deﬁciency
This is a very rare disorder with immunological features identical to XLA
in association with short stature (as opposed to failure to thrive). The disease maps the region of the X chromosome containing the btk gene, but
not all cases appear to have mutations in the btk gene. Prognosis appears
to be good. It is treated with IVIg and growth hormone.

Common variable immunodeﬁciency
(CVID)
CVID is the most common symptomatic antibody deﬁciency with an estimated incidence of 1 in 25 000-66 000, based on Scandinavian data.

Cause
• Cause of CVID is unknown: one hypothesis suggests that an
environmental insult (virus infection?) in a genetically susceptible
individual triggers the disease. No conclusive viral trigger has been
identiﬁed.

COMMON VARIABLE IMMUNODEFICIENCY (CVID)

• Some evidence for a genetic background (linked to MHC
A1B8DR3C4Q0 and to polymorphisms in the TNF-A gene).
• May be a family history of other antibody deﬁciencies (especially IgA
deﬁciency and IgG subclass deﬁciency) in up to 50% of cases, although
other family members may be entirely asymptomatic.
• Disease is heterogeneous in phenotype and immunological ﬁndings.
• Diagnosis is now one of exclusion, once other genetic diseases have
been ruled out.
• Some CVID patients have been identiﬁed with mutations in TACI and
BAFF-R. Signiﬁcance is uncertain—may not be disease-causing.
• SNPs in the gene for Msh5 have been reported, with increased
frequency in patients with CVID and IgA deﬁciency.

Presentation
• May present at any age from childhood through to old age, although
the peak of presentation is in early childhood and early adulthood.
• Usual presentation is with recurrent bacterial infections, as for XLA.
• May present with autoimmune problems, especially thrombocytopenia,
haemolytic anaemia, and organ-speciﬁc autoimmunity (e.g. thyroid,
diabetes, vitiligo, and alopecia); these are common and may precede
the development of recurrent infections.
• Nodular lymphoid hyperplasia of bowel (polyclonal hyperplasia of
Peyer’s patches) is unique to CVID. The cause is unknown, but it is
possibly premalignant. This has characteristic features on small-bowel
radiology.
• Granulomatous disease with lymphadenopathy and (hepato-)
splenomegaly, often involving the lung, is common in the severe form
of CVID (about 25% of cases). Disease resembles sarcoidosis, but is
Kveim-test negative (although this test is now rarely used). Speciﬁcally
associated with complete absence of class-switch memory B cells.
• More severe cases may develop opportunist infections (see late-onset
combined immunodeﬁciency, p.43).

Diagnosis
• History gives the clues. Clues are usually missed by general physicians
and an average diagnostic delay of over 7 years is typical, by which
time structural lung and sinus damage is severe and irretrievable.
• Immunoglobulin levels are variably low: test immunization and
exclusion of secondary loss (gut, urine) may be required.
• Lymphopenia affecting predominantly the CD4+ T cells (CD45RA+
naive cells in particular) and B cells is common.
• When splenomegaly is present it may be difﬁcult to exclude lymphoma,
without CT scanning, lymph node biopsy, and BM examination.

Immunology
• Immunoglobulin levels are highly variable, and IgG may be only
marginally reduced; speciﬁc antibodies are invariably low with poor/
absent immunization responses.
• IgM may be normal, which contrasts with lymphoma, when the IgM is
the ﬁrst immunoglobulin to drop (Chapter 2).

13

14

CHAPTER 1

Primary immunodeﬁciency

• B cells may be normal or low, but some cases in males may be latepresenting XLA.
• CD4+ T cells are low, with speciﬁc depletion of CD45RA+ T cells.
T-cell function to antigens and mitogens is poor in vivo and in vitro, and
there is poor NK-cell function, with reduced NK-cell numbers.
• Abnormalities of 5′-nucleotidase activity on the lymphocyte surface
have been described but this is not a separate syndrome as is
sometimes stated. The signiﬁcance of the abnormality is not known.

Classiﬁcation
Three groups are identiﬁed on the basis of B-cell responses to IL-2 +
anti-IgM in vitro.
• Group A: severe disease, with granulomata (hepatosplenomegaly); no
IgG or IgM production in vitro.
• Group B: rare; IgM production only in vitro (?cryptic hyper-IgM).
• Group C: mild disease; IgG and IgM production in vitro.
This technique is unsuited to routine diagnosis; identiﬁcation of classswitch memory B cells is more useful (group A patients lack class-switch
memory B cells).
Clinical grouping by complications has been used as an alternative.
• No complications.
• Polyclonal lymphocytic inﬁltration.
• Enteropathy.
• Lymphoid malignancy.
83% of patients show a single clinical phenotype.
Phenotyping by ﬂow cytometry has also been used (EUROclass trial).
Three patterns emerge.
• Nearly absent B cells (<1%).
• Severely reduced class-switched memory B cells (<2%)—may be seen
in other PIDs (Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, XLPS, idiopathic CD4
lymphopenia, and CGD).
• Expansion of CD21low B cells (associated with lymphoproliferative
disease and splenomegaly) >10%. CD24 may also be helpful in
analysing this subset; calcium signalling is also abnormal.
Reduction of Treg is associated with an increase in autoimmune disease.

CVID 2: complications and treatment
Complications
• Major complications of CVID relate to the delay in diagnosis with
structural damage from infection: bronchiectasis and chronic sinusitis.
• Patients may also have unusual infections, such as Campylobacter
cholangitis, and Mycoplasma/Ureaplasma arthritis (see XLA, p.10).
Rarely, opportunist infections such as Pneumocystis occur (but this
should suggest hyper-IgM syndromes).
• Malabsorption may occur due to a coeliac-like enteropathy, with
villous atrophy.
• Inﬂammatory bowel disease may occur with strictures.

CVID 2: COMPLICATIONS AND TREATMENT

• Nodular regenerative hyperplasia of the liver is seen.
• Granulomatous disease may affect any organ (brain, lungs, liver, spleen,
lymph nodes, skin, eye).
• In group A patients with splenomegaly, hypersplenism may occur with
marked thrombocytopenia: splenectomy may be required.
• 40-fold increase in the risk of lymphoma, including intestinal lymphoma;
any patient with lymphadenopathy should have a lymph node biopsy
and BM examination to exclude the diagnosis. Lymphomas are often
high grade and respond poorly to treatment.
• Increase in gastric carcinoma, not related to Helicobacter pylori
colonization.
• Autoimmune disease is common, and patients should be monitored
for the development of overt disease (hypothyroidism, pernicious
anaemia, diabetes).
• Thymomas (benign or malignant) are also associated with CVID; this
is Good’s syndrome. These frequently give rise to myasthenia gravis
and haematological problems such as aplastic anaemia and immune
thrombocytopenia (ITP).

Treatment
• The earlier the diagnosis is made, the better the prognosis.
• Treatment is identical to that of XLA, with IVIg/SCIg, antibiotics, and
physiotherapy for chest disease.
• Prophylactic antibiotics should be considered if there is an inadequate
response to optimal immunoglobulin therapy.
• Patients with complete IgA deﬁciency may have a higher risk of
developing anti-IgA antibodies to IVIg therapy, and a product low in IgA
should be selected for them; most IVIg products now have reduced IgA
content. The value of monitoring anti-IgA antibodies is questionable.
• Patients with splenomegaly may catabolize IgG faster and may require
larger doses or more frequent doses (weekly).
• Regular lung function tests (volumes and transfer factor) and HR-CT
scanning is required. Deteriorating lung function requires more
aggressive therapy.
• Chronic sinus disease requires ENT review, with endoscopic inspection.
• Granulomatous disease responds well to steroids (alkaline phosphatase
is a good marker); these are essential if there is interstitial lung
disease (reduced transfer factor). They are not necessary for
asymptomatic splenomegaly. Steroid use is associated with an increased
risk of disseminated shingles. Splenectomy may be necessary for
hypersplenism: such patients must have prophylactic penicillin, but
immunizations are of little value. However, there is an additional risk of
infection after splenectomy in CVID patients and caution is required.
• Treat inﬂammatory bowel disease as for Crohn’s disease.
• Liver disease may cause portal hypertension and hepatic
encephalopathy—shunting may be required.
• Gluten-free diet may help if there is coeliac-like disease.
• Monitor for the development of malignant disease. Review frequency
of cervical smears.
• Consider need for bone mineral density monitoring (malabsorption).

CHAPTER 1

Primary immunodeﬁciency

Experimental therapy
• PEG-IL-2 has been used successfully in a small cohort.
• Retinoic acid has been shown to beneﬁt some patients.
• Cimetidine may also improve immunological function.
• TNF anatagonists have been used with beneﬁt for granulomatous
disease in isolated cases.
• IL-21 increase antibody production in CVID and may be a therapeutic
option.

Selective IgA deﬁciency
Selective IgA deﬁciency is the most common primary immunodeﬁciency,
but mostly passes unnoticed. Depending on the racial group, 1 in 400-800
individuals will be affected.

Cause
• Cause is unknown, although it forms part of the spectrum of disease
with CVID and shares the MHC type (A1, B8, DR3, C4Q0). It occurs
in relatives of patients with CVID in 50% of cases.
• Rarely due to a gene deletion, often including IgG2/IgG4.
• Defects of class switching have been identiﬁed in a few patients.
• Selective deﬁciencies of IgA1 or IgA2 have been reported (all due to
gene deletions).
• May be associated with other chromosomal abnormalities, usually
involving chromosome 18 (18q syndrome and ring chromosome
18). Also with variant Turner’s syndrome (Xq), multibranched
chromosomes, Klinefelter’s syndrome, and A1-antitrypsin deﬁciency.
• Associated with drug therapy, particularly with phenytoin and
penicillamine, although in many reports it is not clear whether the
defect was present before drug therapy was introduced.
• IgA-bearing B cells are present. IgA is synthesized but not secreted.
• In terms of mucosal protection, there is evidence that IgG and IgM
may substitute as secretory immunoglobulins.

Presentation
• Most cases are asymptomatic.
• There is an increased incidence of allergic disease, including food
allergies and intolerances.
• Connective tissue diseases (SLE, rheumatoid arthritis, and juvenile
chronic arthritis), coeliac disease, inﬂammatory bowel disease,
pernicious anaemia, and other organ-speciﬁc autoimmune diseases.
• Nodular lymphoid hyperplasia.
• Increased presence of a range of autoantibodies.
• False-positive pregnancy tests due to heterophile antibodies.
• Infections are rarely a problem unless additional humoral defects are
present.
• Occasional cases will come to light as a result of adverse reactions
to blood products. This is deemed to be very rare (incidence 1 in
15 million transfusions).

SELECTIVE IGA DEFICIENCY

Diagnosis
• Requires the demonstration of undetectable IgA, not just a low IgA.
Automated analysers do not read low enough to ascertain this beyond
doubt. Check with low-level radial immunodiffusion or Ouchterlony
double-diffusion assays.
• Beware of the presence of anti-animal antibodies in IgA deﬁciency
which give false readings in immunoassays using antisera derived from
sheep, goats, and horses.
• Patients should be screened for evidence of other humoral defects:
IgG subclasses and speciﬁc antibodies if there is a history of infections.
If there is doubt, then test immunization should be undertaken.
• IgA antibodies can be measured but current assays detect IgG and
IgM antibodies and therefore do not identify risk of anaphylaxis. The
signiﬁcance of IgG and IgM anti-IgA antibodies is uncertain. High levels
may be seen in the absence of reactions. There is only one report of
detection of IgE anti-IgA antibodies.

Immunology
• The IgA will be undetectable (< 0.05g/L), but total IgG and IgM will be
normal. IgG subclasses may be reduced (G2 and G4). Secreted IgA will
be absent (secretory piece deﬁciency is vanishingly rare), but testing
for this is of little clinical value.
• T-cell function is normal (PHA and antigens).
• Auto-antibodies may be present (NB anti-IgA antibodies). There will
be an increased IgE in the presence of atopic disease.
• In the absence of IgA, IgM and IgG appear on mucosal surfaces.

Complications
• A major problem with IgA deﬁciency is the possibility of transfusion
reactions thought to be due to anti-IgA antibodies. These are extremely
rare (1 in 15 million). The Blood Transfusion Service in Shefﬁeld (UK)
will carry out conﬁrmatory tests and issue a blood transfusion warning
card.
• Malignancy may be increased, although this may depend on other
diseases present in association with IgA deﬁciency, especially
lymphoma and gastric adenocarcinoma.
• It is possible that there may be progression to more signiﬁcant
humoral immunodeﬁciency with time.

Treatment
• Treatment is directed at the presenting disease.
• Avoid IgA-containing products if possible: The National Blood
Authority no longer routinely provides blood products from IgAdeﬁcient donors. Use an IVIg/SCIg (if required) with a low IgA content.
• Where immunoglobulin replacement therapy is required for recurrent
infections, this has been shown to be safe.
• In view of the low risk of reactions, the wearing or carrying of an alert
card is of doubtful value.

17

18

CHAPTER 1

Primary immunodeﬁciency

Selective IgA2 deﬁciency
Cases have been reported with selective IgA2 deﬁciency, with normal
IgA1. This does not appear to be due to heavy-chain gene deletions affecting the A2 gene in all cases.

IgG subclass deﬁciency
Cause
• The cause of IgG subclass deﬁciency is unknown, but it forms part of
the spectrum with CVID and IgA deﬁciency. It is possible that some
cases represent CVID in evolution. Rarely, cases may be due to gene
deletions, but these individuals may be entirely healthy.
• IgG subclass levels are related to allotypes of IgG (Gm allotypes);
therefore different racial groups may have different ‘normal’ ranges,
• depending on the prevalence of different allotypes. This should be
taken into account when diagnosing IgG subclass deﬁciency.

Presentation
• As for CVID, presentation can be at any age. Recurrent infections may
be a feature, particularly for IgG2 ± IgG4 deﬁciency. IgG4 deﬁciency
occurring alone has also been associated with bronchiectasis.
• Other conditions associated with subclass deﬁciency include asthma
(IgG3 deﬁciency), sinusitis (IgG3 deﬁciency), intractable epilepsy
of childhood (although this may be due to anticonvulsants), and
autoimmune disease (SLE).

Diagnosis
• Measurement of IgG subclasses on more than one occasion is required
and it is important to check that appropriate age-speciﬁc normal
ranges are used (preferably related to the racial background).
• Detection of low levels of IgG4 may require more sensitive assays to
detect true absence; earlier normal ranges using less sensitive assays
found a signiﬁcant number of individuals with undetectable IgG4. Most
of these have detectable IgG4 on sensitive assays.
• There is a poor correlation of speciﬁc anti-pathogen responses
and IgG subclass levels. All patients should have speciﬁc antibodies
measured and be test immunized.
• Detection of low or absent subclasses does not necessarily correlate
with clinical disease.

Immunology
• A normal total IgG is entirely compatible with subclass deﬁciency,
although low IgG1 usually reduces the total IgG (this also behaves like
CVID for practical purposes). The IgA is normal or low; IgM is normal.
• B- and T-cell numbers are usually normal.
• Poor speciﬁc antibody responses to bacterial and viral antigens may be
present in some patients.

SPECIFIC ANTIBODY DEFICIENCY

Complications

• Long-term progression to CVID is a possibility.
• Bronchiectasis may occur in IgG4 deﬁciency.

Treatment
• Treatment is controversial: only symptomatic patients should be
treated. If recurrent infections are a problem, the ﬁrst step might be
to use continuous antibiotics, followed by IVIg if infections are not
controlled.
• IVIg has been shown to be of beneﬁt in asthma due to IgG3 deﬁciency
(and, interestingly, a low IgG3 preparation worked), and in chronic
sinusitis.
• It is theoretically possible to bypass IgG2 deﬁciency using proteinconjugated polysaccharide vaccines to generate a protective IgG1
response.

Speciﬁc antibody deﬁciency with
normal serum immunoglobulins
This syndrome is probably much more common than hitherto realized.

Cause
• The cause is unknown. It is unrelated to IgG subclass deﬁciencies.
There is usually a failure to respond to polysaccharide antigens
(T-independent) and possibly other protein antigens (HBsAg?).
• In small children, it may be due to a maturational delay that resolves
spontaneously.

Presentation
• Recurrent bacterial infection of upper and lower respiratory tract
(Haemophilus, Pneumococcus, Moraxella) is the usual presentation.
• In immunization programmes for hepatitis B, about 5% of individuals
fail to respond to the standard three-dose schedule; a fourth dose still
leaves 1-2% who fail to make a serological response. These patients
clearly have some form of speciﬁc immune deﬁcit (see Chapter 2 for
the approach to management of these individuals).

Diagnosis
• There is a history of recurrent typical infections with normal
immunoglobulins and IgG subclasses.
• Proof requires demonstration of failure to respond to speciﬁc antigens
(test immunization).

Immunology
• Immunoglobulins and IgG subclasses are normal, but there are low
speciﬁc antibodies, especially to capsulated organisms, and poor
responses to test immunization, especially to polysaccharide antigens
(Pneumovax II®).

19

20

CHAPTER 1

Primary immunodeﬁciency

• The use of serotype-speciﬁc responses may add conﬁdence to the
diagnosis.
• Salmonella typhi Vi antigen has also been evaluated as a test antigen.
• Meningococcal polysaccharide vaccines may be used but the
serological responses are less well established.
• For all vaccines, a normal response is a rise in titre into the protective
range and a 4x increase over the pre-immunization level. Ideally, pre-and
post-vaccine samples should be run on the same assays as the inter-assay
coefﬁcient of variation (CV) of speciﬁc antibody assays is high.
• Children under the age of 2 years do not respond to Pneumovax II®.
However, the inability to respond to polysaccharide antigens in infants
may be bypassed by conjugation of the polysaccharide to a protein, for
example, the Hib-conjugate vaccines and Prevenar®, the heptavalent
pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine.
• T- and B-lymphocyte numbers and T-cell function are normal.

Complications
0Long delay in diagnosis leads to structural lung damage. Delay may be of
the order of 15-20 years because clinicians fail to recognize immunodeﬁciency in the presence of normal total immunoglobulins.

Treatment
Treatment is still controversial. Conjugate vaccines should be tried to
bypass defect if this is ineffective.
• First step should be prophylactic antibiotics (azithromycin 250-500mg
od 3x/week, adult dose); tetracycline 500mg bd is an alternative, but is
less effective.
• Continuous antibiotics are inadequate for patients with established
lung disease; these should be managed on IVIg/SCIg as for XLA. No
randomized placebo-controlled trials.
• In small children, spontaneous improvement may occur, and
continuous prophylactic antibiotics and close supervision may be
sufﬁcient.
1 Remember. Normal serum immunoglobulins and IgG subclasses do not
exclude humoral immune deﬁciency!

X-linked hyper-IgM syndrome (HIGM-1)
Originally this was thought to be a B-cell disorder, but the demonstration
in the X-linked form of a primary T-cell defect means that this form should
be reclassiﬁed as a T-cell defect. However, the predominant effect is of a
humoral immune deﬁciency.

Cause
• the X-linked form has now been shown to be due to a deﬁciency
of the CD40-ligand (CD154) on T cells (gene located at Xq26-27)
required for B-cell immunoglobulin class switch.
• CD40 is also expressed on monocyte-macrophages, and the
interaction with CD40L is integral to antigen presentation.

X-LINKED HYPER-IGM SYNDROME (HIGM-1)

Presentation
• Presentation is with recurrent bacterial infections; this may include
Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia.
• There is often neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. Autoimmune
disease of all types is common.

Diagnosis
• There is usually an early onset; the diagnosis should always be
considered when Pneumocystis pneumonia is the presenting illness. The
differential diagnosis includes SCID and HIV infection.
• There will be a normal or high IgM, with low IgG and IgA.
• Most cases can be identiﬁed by failure to upregulate expression of
CD154 on activation of T cells; this does not identify cases where
point mutations permit expression of non-functional CD154.
• Genetic identiﬁcation is possible.

Immunology
• IgM (and IgD) are normally raised with a low IgG and IgA. However,
the IgM may be normal in the absence of infection. There will be high
isohaemagglutinins. Speciﬁc IgM responses are present but may be
short-lived. IgM+ and IgD+ B cells are present.
• T-cell function may be normal or poor. Some patients have
reduced cell-mediated immunity, as evidenced by the occurrence of
Pneumocystis infection. The expression of CD40-ligand on activated
T cells may be defective (use PMA + ionophore).
• Mild variants exist compatible with minimal disease and survival into
adult life.

Complications
• Opportunist pneumonias; there appears to be a particular risk of
cryptosporidial infection of the biliary tree, leading to a severe
cholangitis and liver failure.
• Autoimmune diseases including haemolytic anaemic,
thrombocytopenia, and neutropenia; parvovirus-induced anaemia.
• Increased risk of lymphomas (IgM+, due to chronic overstimulation)
and hepatocellular, bile duct, and neuroendocrine carcinomas.
• Long-term prognosis without transplantation is poor (infections and
liver disease) in X-linked hyper-IgM syndrome (HIGM-1).

Treatment
• IVIg/SCIg should be started at the earliest opportunity: the IgM returns
to the normal range with adequate therapy. Doses should be in the
range 0.4-0.6g/kg every 2-3 weeks.
• Prompt antibiotics are required for infections, as for other antibody
deﬁciencies.
• Consideration should be given to the use of PCP prophylaxis
(co-trimoxazole 480mg bd, 960mg od, or 960mg 3x/week;
azithromycin and atovaquone are alternatives where co-trimoxazole
cannot be tolerated).

21

22

CHAPTER 1

Primary immunodeﬁciency

• All drinking water, even if bottled, should be boiled, as domestic
supplies cannot be guaranteed to be free of Cryptosporidium.
• Bone marrow/stem cell transplantation (BMT/SCT) is the treatment of
choice, where the diagnosis is made early in life and compatible donors
are available.
• Liver transplantation may be required for liver disease secondary to
Cryptosporidium infection.

Autosomal hyper-IgM syndromes
Four rare types of autosomal hyper-IgM have now been identiﬁed.

HIGM-2
• Caused by defects in the activation-induced cytidine deaminase gene
(AID gene, 12p13).
• Intrinsic B-cell defect with failure to class-switch. B cells express CD19,
sIgM, and sIgD.
• T-cell function is normal: opportunistic infections such as Pneumocystis
do not occur.
• T-cell expression of CD154 is normal.
• Lymphoid histology is abnormal, with hyperplasia and giant germinal
centres.
• Presentation is with recurrent bacterial and gastrointestinal infections
from early in childhood.
• Treatment is with IVIg/SCIg.

HIGM-3
• Caused by deﬁciency of CD40 expression on B cells owing to a
genetic defect (20q12-13.2).
• Clinical features are identical to those of HIGM-1, and opportunist
infections can occur.
• Class-switch memory B cells are markedly reduced or absent.
• Monocyte function is also defective (CD40 is expressed on
monocytes). CD40 is also expressed on endothelial cells.
• Neutropenia may occur.
• Increased risk of lymphomas and hepatocellular, bile duct, and
neuroendocrine carcinomas.
• Treatment is the same as for HIGM-1 with IVIg/SCIg, prophylaxis
against PCP, and consideration of BMT/SCT, although the latter will
not completely restore CD40 expression in non-haematopoietic cell
lineages.

HIGM-4
• Clinically a mild variant of HIGM-2, but with normal AID levels.
• The molecular defect is unknown.
• Some IgG production may occur.

HIGM-5
• Due to defects in uracil-DNA glycosylase (UNG).

X-LINKED LYMPHOPROLIFERATIVE DISEASE TYPE 1

• Clinically resembles HIGM-2.
• From the limited clinical experience, IVIg/SCIg would appear to be the
treatment of choice.

X-linked ectodermal dysplasia with HIGM (NEMO
deﬁciency; IκBα deﬁciency)
• Cases have been reported of X-linked ectodermal dysplasia with
HIGM due to loss-of-function mutations in the NEMO gene (Xq28),
coding for IKK-G, which block the release of NFκB on cellular
activation.
• Not all patients with NEMO mutations have extodermal dysplasia.
• Gain-of-function mutations in IκBA, with which IKK-G interacts,
have been reported to produce an autosomal dominant ectodermal
dysplasia similar to NEMO deﬁciency.
• IL-10 production is lacking.
• Patients with NEMO mutations have impaired polysaccharide
responses.
• IgA levels may be increased more than IgM.
• Patients with IκBA mutations have hypogammaglobulinaemia, reduced
CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, and absent T-cell proliferation to anti-CD3.
• Clinical features include early-onset severe bacterial and viral
infections, atypical mycobacterial infections, chronic diarrhoea,
bronchiectasis, and failure to thrive.
• Hypomorphic NEMO mutations have also been associated with
ectodermal dysplasia associated with osteopetrosis and lymphoedema,
and incontinentia pigmenti.
• Prophylactic antibiotics are required.
• Anti-herpes prophylaxis may be required.
• Treatment with IVIg is helpful.
• HSCT has been used in both NEMO and IκBA mutations, with
successful outcomes.

X-linked lymphoproliferative disease
type 1, SAP deﬁciency (Duncan’s
syndrome, XLP-1)
This is a very rare genetic disorder, leading to failure to handle EBV
correctly.

Cause
• The genetic defect has been localized to Xq26, and the gene has now
been cloned.
• The gene product SAP (SLAM-associated protein, SH2D1A) controls
the activation of T and B cells via SLAM (signalling lymphocyte
activation molecule), a surface protein. SLAM is involved in G-IFN
production and the switch from Th2 to Th1.
• The reason for the failure to handle EBV appropriately is not yet known.

23

24

CHAPTER 1

Primary immunodeﬁciency

Presentation
• Patients are ﬁt and well until EBV is encountered. Upon infection with
EBV, ﬁve outcomes are possible.
• Fulminant EBV infection (58%); mortality is 96%!
• Haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH).
• EBV+ non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (30%); risk of lymphoma is 200-fold
greater than in the normal population.
• Immunodeﬁciency, usually profound hypogammaglobulinaemia
(30%). Some cases have been misdiagnosed as CVID.
• Aplastic anaemia, often associated with hepatitis (3%).
• Vasculitis, lymphomatoid granulomatosis (3%).
• Overall mortality was 85% by the age of 10 years but is now improving,
especially for patients with HLH and lymphoma.
• Survival is only 18.6% for untransplanted patients with HLH.
• Overall survival is now 62.5% for untransplanted patients on Ig
replacement.
• Mild cases are recognized.

Diagnosis
• Diagnosis is difﬁcult, especially if there is fulminant EBV infection.
• Flow cytometric tests for intracellular proteins can demonstrate the
presence of protein, but this does not exclude mutations causing the
production of non-functional proteins.
• Follow-up genetic testing for both SAP and XIAP is required.

Immunology
• Immunology is usually normal before infection, but it is rarely checked
unless there is a family history. Carriers may have subtle immunological
abnormalities, such as unusually high anti-EBV VCA antibodies.
• After infection, in those who survive, there are reduced
immunoglobulins (all three classes). T-cell proliferation to mitogens
and antigens is poor, and there is reduced G-IFN production.
NK-cell function is also poor. CD8+ T cells may be persistently
elevated.
• Antibodies to EBV may be poor or even absent.

Treatment
• IVIG/SCIg should be used for the hypogammaglobulinaemia.
• HSCT may be an option as part of the treatment of lymphoma.
Survival after HSCT with good immune reconstitution is 81%.
• Prophylactic use of aciclovir in at-risk family members is of unproven
value.
• During acute fulminant EBV, therapy directed against the abnormal
CD8+ T cells (Campath®) and transformed B cells (rituximab,
anti-CD20) may be valuable.

TRANSIENT HYPOGAMMAGLOBULINAEMIA OF INFANCY (THI)

X-linked lymphoproliferative disease
Type 2, XIAP deﬁciency (XLP-2)
XIAP is an (X-linked) inhibitor of apoptosis, also known as BIRC4, and
stops cell death triggered by viral infection or excess caspase production.

Cause
• Genetic defect has been localized to Xq24-25.
• XIAP binds to and inhibits caspases 3, 7, and 9.

Presentation
• Mutations in XIAP have been associated with severe inﬂammatory
bowel disease.
• Similar presentations to XLP-1 may occur.
• Asymptomatic cases are described.

Diagnosis
• Based on clinical suspicion followed up by genetic testing.
• Flow cytometric tests for intracellular proteins can demonstrate the
presence of protein, but this does not exclude mutations causing the
production of non-functional proteins.

Immunology
• XLP-2 patients have increased lymphocyte apoptosis in response to
CD95.
• iNKT cells are normal and NK-mediated cytotoxicity is normal.

Treatment
• AS for XLP-1.

Transient hypogammaglobulinaemia
of infancy (THI)
Cause
• THI is thought to be due to a delay in immune development, leading
to a prolongation of the physiological trough of antibody after the age
of 6 months when maternal antibody has largely disappeared.
• Common in families of patients with other antibody deﬁciencies.
• Diagnosis excludes hypogammaglobulinaemia by reasons of
prematurity.

Presentation
• Usual presentation is with recurrent bacterial infections, typically of
the upper and lower respiratory tract, occurring after 6 months of age.
It may last up to 36 months before spontaneous recovery takes place.
• Transient neutropenia and thrombocytopenia have been reported.

25

26

CHAPTER 1

Primary immunodeﬁciency

Diagnosis
• There will be an early onset.
• Presence of normal B-cell numbers differentiates THI from XLA. IgM
is frequently normal, and there may be evidence of speciﬁc antibody
responsiveness.
• Check for btk expression to exclude XLA.
• No speciﬁc diagnostic features, and the diagnosis can only be made for
certain after full recovery of immune function has taken place.

Immunology
• IgG and IgA are low for age; IgM is usually normal. B cells are present;
T-cell numbers and function are normal. IgG must be reduced on
more than one occasion. A reduction to <2 SD below the lower end
of the normal range has been suggested by some authorities.
• Vaccine responses may be normal or reduced.

Treatment
• Mild cases may be managed with prophylactic antibiotics.
• IVIg/SCIg treatment may be required in more severe cases; it can
be used for a ﬁxed period and withdrawn at intervals to check for
spontaneous recovery.
• By deﬁnition all recover! If there is no recovery, the patient has an
alternative diagnosis.

Hyper-IgE syndrome (Job’s syndrome)
Frequently classiﬁed with neutrophil defects, but these are secondary to
the dysregulation of T- and B-cell function and the very raised IgE.

Cause
• Autosomal dominant form is associated with dominant negative
mutations in the DNA-binding domain of signal transducer and
activator transcription (STAT3).
• Autosomal recessive inheritance has also been described and is due to
mutations in tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2); similar clinical features may be
seen in dedicator of cytokinesis 8 (DOCK8) deﬁciency, which is also
autosomal recessive.

Presentation
• Patients present with atypical eczema and recurrent invasive bacterial
infections. Staphylococci and Haemophilus are the usual pathogens.
Invasive candidiasis may occur.
• Pneumatocoeles due to staphylococcal infection are a diagnostic
feature. These may become colonized with Aspergillus or Pseudomonas.
• Non-tuberculous mycobacterial infection may occur in STAT3
deﬁcient patients.
• The dominant form may be associated with invasive fungal infections
and Pneumocystis jirovecii.
• Osteopenia, probably due to abnormal osteoclast function, is a feature
and may lead to recurrent fractures.

RARE ANTIBODY DEFICIENCY SYNDROMES

• Coarse ‘leonine’ facies, but not all patients have red hair as originally
described.
• There is an increased risk of lymphoma.

Diagnosis
• The clinical history is typical, especially the occurrence of pneumatocoeles.
• IgE levels are massively elevated and are usually much higher than in
atopic eczema.
• Occurrence of invasive as opposed to cutaneous infections distinguish
HIGE from atopic eczema.

Immunology
• IgE is massively elevated (>50 000kU/L) and there may be IgG subclass
and speciﬁc antibody deﬁciencies, with poor/absent immunization
responses.
• Eosinophilia may be present, especially during infection
• Variable abnormalities of neutrophil function, affecting chemotaxis,
phagocytosis, and microbicidal activity, have been reported, but are likely
to be due to inhibition by the high IgE or defects in cytokine production.
• Both STAT3 and TYK2 mutations lead to defective Th17 function. There
may be defects in the production of γ-IFN, IL-12, IL-17, and IL-18
• Absent CD45RO on T cells has been reported.

Treatment
• IVIg/SCIg should be used for the antibody deﬁciency.
• Cimetidine (as an immunoregulatory agent) has been recommended,
although the value appears to be limited.
• γ-IFN is used in severe fungal infections (no randomized trials).
• Omalizumab has been tried, but may not be appropriate where there
is very high IgE (unlicensed indication).
• Surgery for pneumatocoeles and deep-seated abscesses may be required.
• Stem cell transplantation has been tried in some cases, with beneﬁt.

Rare antibody deﬁciency syndromes
Antibody deﬁciency, presenting as ‘common variable immunodeﬁciency’,
has been associated with the following extremely rare genetically identiﬁed disorders.
• Mu-chain deﬁciency.
• IgA (CD79a) deﬁciency.
• Igβ (CD79b) deﬁciency
• BLNK deﬁciency.
• ICOS deﬁciency.
• λ5/14.1 (surrogate light-chain, IGLL1, CD179B) deﬁciency.
• SWAP-70 deﬁciency.
• κ and λ light chain-deﬁciency.
• CD20 deﬁciency.
• CD81 (TAPA1) deﬁciency.
• LRRC8A (leucine-rich repeat-containing protein 8A) deﬁciency.

27

28

CHAPTER 1

Primary immunodeﬁciency

Routine genetic tests for these are not yet available; screenings of large
cohorts of CVID patients have shown that these disorders account for
very few cases currently diagnosed as CVID. Flow cytometry will be able
to identify the lack of some surface proteins, where there is a high index
of suspicion.

Severe combined immunodeﬁciency
(SCID)
Severe combined immunodeﬁciency involves both the T-cell arm and the
B-cell arm. Often the major defect is on the T-cell side; B cells may be
present but, in the absence of T cells, fail to respond or develop appropriately. The diagnosis is frequently missed at ﬁrst, which reduces the chance
of a successful outcome from treatment. It is estimated that the incidence
is 1 in 50 000 births. Almost all cases are now accounted for by identiﬁed
genetic defects.
Successful management of SCID requires a multidisciplinary team used
to dealing with very sick small infants. Management should be restricted
to centres experienced in the diagnosis and care of SCID. It should not
be undertaken in haematology-oncology bone marrow transplant units as
the requirements are very different from those of leukaemic patients.

Presentation
Most cases of SCID present with common clinical features, no matter
what the underlying defect.
• Typical features include:
• early-onset infections (bacterial, viral, fungal, opportunist)
• persistent candidiasis
• chronic enteric virus excretion
• failure to clear vaccines (BCG, oral polio)
• failure to thrive
• maternofetal engraftment (MFE), with GvHD, causing erythroderma
(often with eosinophilia).
• 0 Lymphopenia: an absolute lymphocyte count of <2×109/L in a baby
less than 6 months old is pathological and indicates SCID until proven
otherwise. Therefore it is mandatory to looking at the differential
white count in all babies with recurrent infections.
• If SCID is suspected, investigation is URGENT—seek advice at once
from a paediatric immunologist.

Infections in SCID
There is onset of infections soon after birth.
• These include:
• recurrent bacterial infections (pneumonia, otitis media, sepsis)
• persistent thrush
• persistent viral infections (RSV, enteroviruses, parainﬂuenza, CMV,
other herpesviruses, rotavirus, small round structured virus (SRSV))

SCID: INVESTIGATIONS IN SUSPECTED CASES

• opportunist infections (PCP; fungal infections, including Aspergillus).
• There are very signiﬁcant risks from the administration of live vaccines
especially BCG and polio.
0 BCG should not be given to babies where there is a family history of
SCID.

Other features of SCID
•
•
•
•

Failure to thrive.
Diarrhoea (consider chronic enteroviral infection, rotavirus, SRSV).
Skin rash (Omenn’s syndrome, MFE).
Bone abnormalities (ﬂared ribs—ADA deﬁciency;
malabsorption—rickets).
• Short-limbed skeletal dysplasia.
• Hepatosplenomegaly (BCGosis, graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) from
MFE or blood transfusions, Omenn’s syndrome).

SCID: investigations in suspected cases
On suspicion, ﬁrst-line investigations
• Lymphocyte subpopulations (T-, B-, NK-, and T-cell subpopulations,
with absolute numbers).
• Immunoglobulins.
• If the results are suspicious, the baby should be referred at the earliest
opportunity to a specialist centre with facilities for managing SCID.

Further investigations in the specialist referral centre
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

T-cell proliferation.
Cytokine assays.
NK-cell function.
Protein studies.
Speciﬁc antibodies.
Biochemical (exclusion of ADA deﬁciency).
Genetic studies.
HLA typing as part of work-up for bone marrow transplantation
(BMT).

Aims of the initial investigations
• To conﬁrm the diagnosis of SCID.
• To identify unusual variants, as this may affect the conditioning
protocol used prior to HSCT.
• To provide evidence for subsequent genetic counselling of the family.
• To provide a baseline against which success of BMT can be measured.

Patterns of lymphocyte subpopulations in SCID and variants
• It cannot be stressed too often how important a low total lymphocyte
count is as a marker of SCID: low lymphocyte counts should never be
ignored.

CHAPTER 1

Primary immunodeﬁciency

• Typical pattern is of very low/absent T cells with normal or absent B
cells; immature T cells may be present in low numbers (CD3+, CD2+,
CD4-, CD8-).
• SCID with MFE: T cells are present but are usually CD8+ and activated
(CD25+, DR+); B cells are usually low or absent. Maternal origin of the
cells may be conﬁrmed by genetic studies.
• Omenn’s syndrome (leaky SCID): T cells may be present, including
CD4+ T cells; clonal restriction with limited Tcr αβ-chain repertoire
(this requires genetic analysis).
• Bare lymphocyte syndrome (see SCID: MHC class I deﬁciency (bare
lymphocyte syndrome type I), p.40, and SCID: MHC class II deﬁciency
(bare lymphocyte syndrome type II), p.40): absence or marked
reduction of MHC class II antigen expression with variable MHC class I
antigen expression; T cells are normal or low.
• ZAP-70 kinase deﬁciency and ζ-chain deﬁciency (see SCID: ZAP-70
kinase deﬁciency and ADA deﬁciency, p.37+p.38): marked reduction/
absence of CD8+ T cells; low normal CD4+ T cells.
• Absence of CD3-Tcr complexes (CD3 G-, D-, or ε-chains), variable
expression of CD3: T-cell numbers are usually normal.

Proliferation assays
• Functional studies are useful in cases when T cells are present.
• PHA response: invariably absent in all major forms of SCID, including
Omenn’s syndrome and SCID with MFE; may be low-normal in ZAP70 kinase deﬁciency.
• Phorbol esters (PMA) ± calcium ionophore: will be normal where
there is a membrane defect (e.g. ZAP-70 kinase or CD3 complex) that
can be bypassed (PMA acts intracellularly on protein kinase C).
• Anti-CD3 ± IL-2: abnormal when the defect involves the CD3-Tcr
complex (e.g. CD3 deﬁciency, ZAP-70 kinase deﬁciency). The normal
newborn anti-CD3 response is lower than in adults.
• Reconstitution of proliferation to mitogens with IL-2 may suggest a
failure to produce this cytokine.

Cytokine assays
Rarely used: IL-2 deﬁciency has been reported but is exceptionally rare.

Immunoglobulins
• If the diagnosis is made within the ﬁrst few weeks of life, maternal
antibody will still be present.
• Even if the child has B+ SCID, immunoglobulins and speciﬁc antibody
are not produced.
• It may be worth checking for speciﬁc antibodies if there is late
presentation and the child has been immunized.

Biochemistry and genetics
• Check for ADA deﬁciency: abnormal metabolites (dATP, S-adenosyl
homocysteine) will be present.
• It is possible to test genetically for speciﬁc genetic abnormalities,
e.g. X-linked SCID (common cytokine receptor G-chain gene), Jak-3,

SCID: TREATMENT AND OUTCOMES

IL-7Ra, RAG-1/RAG-2 MHC class II deﬁciency (CIITA or RFX-5 genes),
ZAP-70 kinase deﬁciency, CD3G-, D-, ε-chain deﬁciency.
• The genetics department will be able to assist in the distinction of
Omenn’s syndrome from SCID with MFE: skin biopsies are helpful.
Cytogenetics can be used if the baby is male; otherwise molecular
genetics is required.

Screening
• Screening is possible using a multiplex immunoassay on the standard
Guthrie blood spot, or through measuring TRECs.
• Pilot studies are underway to evaluate the utility of screening.

SCID: treatment and outcomes
Treatment
The approach to treatment is also common to all types.
• Isolation to prevent further infection.
• Do not give any live vaccines.
• Irradiate all cellular blood products to prevent engraftment of any
donor lymphocytes.
• Ensure that all blood products are from CMV-negative donors.
• Identify and treat all infections: use direct culture and PCR-based
techniques.
• Transfer to nearest specialist paediatric immunodeﬁciency centre with
facilities for deﬁnitive treatment immediately diagnosis is suspected.
• Do not initiate investigations for underlying cause.
0 Delay in transfer signiﬁcantly reduces the chances of a successful outcome (90% success rate for babies diagnosed and treated immediately
after birth, compared with 40% where treatment is delayed).
Once in the tertiary centre, management will include the following.
• Isolation in laminar ﬂow.
• Establish venous access and commence nutritional support (enteral or
parenteral) if required.
• Initiation of diagnostic tests: T- and B-cell numbers; baseline T-cell
function; serum immunoglobulins; screen for pathogens (nasal
secretions, bronchial lavage, stool, urine, blood). Biopsies as required
(lymph nodes, skin for GvHD).
• Undertake genetic testing to identify gene defect, if possible.
• Tissue typing of baby and family; initiation of search for matched
unrelated donor on bone marrow registries.
• Counsel family about diagnosis and treatment.
• Initiation of IVIg replacement.
• Use PEG-ADA as a temporizing measure in ADA-deﬁcient SCID (see
SCID: ADA deﬁciency, p.38).
• Initiate aggressive treatment for identiﬁed infections with antibacterials,
antivirals, and antifungals as appropriate—good microbiological and
virological control is essential.

31

32

CHAPTER 1

Primary immunodeﬁciency

• Cytoreductive conditioning of recipient (to prepare space for incoming
stem cells).
• T-cell depletion of donor marrow (for mismatched grafts).
• Undertake BMT/SCT as appropriate; consider gene therapy (currently
suspended because of development of leukaemias arising from the
insertion of genes close to the proto-oncogene LMO-2). BMT may be:
• sibling (identical)
• parent (haplo-identical);
• matched unrelated donor (MUD)
• stem cell.
• Undertake post-BMT/HSCT immunological monitoring, treating
infection and GvHD as appropriate.

Outcomes
• Outcome depends on the promptness of the diagnosis and the
infections present at the time of diagnosis. Poor prognostic indicators
are late diagnosis and chronic viral infections (especially parainﬂuenza
pneumonitis).
• Meticulous care is required during the aplastic phase between
conditioning and engraftment: this will require cell support (platelets,
red cells), infection prophylaxis and treatment (fungi, viruses, and
bacteria), management of the complications of conditioning
(veno-occlusive disease of the liver; pneumonitis) and of GvHD
(mismatched donors).
• Survival should be >80% with early diagnosis, good matching of
donors, and no pre-transplant infections. This falls to < 40% with late
diagnosis, chronic infections, and poorly matched donors.
Regular monitoring post-HSCT is required to follow engraftment and
development of immune function. This should include the following.
• Lymphocyte subpopulations: the return of T and B cells, expression
of activation markers in association with GvHD, effectiveness of
immunosuppression.
• T-cell proliferation: this is only valuable when T cells have returned to
the circulation. The return of a PHA response deﬁnes probable safety
for release from laminar ﬂow conﬁnement.
• NK-cell function and numbers may correlate with graft survival.
• Immunoglobulins: adequacy of replacement IVIg therapy, return of IgA
and IgM synthesis, IgG subclass development (off IVIg).
• Speciﬁc antibodies: return of functional antibodies (isohaemagglutinins,
immunization responses).
• Genetic studies: chimerism of lymphocytes (DNA studies on separated
T and B cells).
• Biochemical reconstitution (ADA deﬁciency, enzyme deﬁciencies
(e.g. ZAP-70 kinase)).

T-B-NK +SCID

T-B-NK+SCID: RAG-1/RAG-2 deﬁciency
and Omenn’s syndrome
RAG-1/RAG-2 deﬁciency
Cause
• Autosomal recessive. Mutations in RAG-1/RAG-2 genes, required for
V(D)J recombination of the T- and B-cell antigen receptors. Located at
11p13.
• Now known to account for Omenn’s syndrome (‘leaky SCID’).
Presentation
• As a typical SCID; see Severe combined immunodeﬁciency (SCID), p.28.
• There is no radiation sensitivity.
Diagnosis
• Typical presentation with recurrent infections and lymphopenia on full
blood count.
• Conﬁrmed by immunological and genetic studies.
Immunology
• Low/absent serum immunoglobulins, severe lymphopenia (T-B- SCID).
• NK cells are present and comprise the majority of circulating
lymphocytes.
• MFE is common.

Omenn’s syndrome
Cause
• Autosomal recessive. Mutations in RAG-1/RAG-2 genes, required for
V(D)J recombination of the T- and B-cell antigen receptors. Located at
11p13.
• Partial activity present, allowing the development of oligoclonal,
peripherally expanded T-cell clones.
Presentation
• Presents with erythrodermic rash, lymphadenopathy, and
hepatosplenomegaly; must be distinguished from MFE.
• Cytogenetics of the peripheral blood cells may identify maternal cells.
Diagnosis
• May be difﬁcult.
• Cytogenetics is required to exclude MFE.
• Immunological tests are variable.
• Oligoclonal T-cell pattern is distinctive.
Immunology
• Eosinophilia.
• Leucocytosis, variable CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell numbers; high level of
activation marker expression (DR, CD25, CD45RO).
• B cells absent; hypogammaglobulinaemia usual.
• Oligoclonal Tcr usage.
• Abnormal lymph node histology: excess eosinophils, lymphocyte
depletion.

33

34

CHAPTER 1

Primary immunodeﬁciency

Artemis deﬁciency
This defect causes a T-B-NK+ radiation-sensitive phenotype of SCID, similar to RAG-1/RAG-2 deﬁciency. It is present in the Athabascan-derived
population (Navajo and Apache Indians).

Cause
• Mutation in the Artemis gene (DCLRE1C), located on chromosome
10p13, which is involved in DNA repair probably through interaction
with DNA-PKcs.

Presentation
• As for SCID, but prone to oral and genital ulcers.
• May cause Omenn-like phenotype.

Diagnosis
• Should be considered in cases of T-B-NK+ SCID, where RAG-1/RAG-2
mutations are not found.

Immunology
• Profound T- and B-cell lymphopenia with normal NK-cell numbers and
function.
• MFE common.

Cernunnos/XLF deﬁciency
This defect causes a T-B-NK+ radiation-sensitive phenotype of SCID or
sometimes CID, similar to RAG-1/RAG-2 deﬁciency.

Cause
• Mutation in the Cernunnos/XLF gene, involved in DNA repair probably
through interaction with XECC4/DNA ligase IV complex.

Presentation
• As for SCID, but with developmental delay, microcephaly.

Diagnosis
• Should be considered in cases of T-B-NK+ SCID, where RAG-1/RAG-2
mutations are not found.

Immunology
• T cells absent with progressive loss of B cells.

DNA ligase IV (LIG4) deﬁciency
This defect causes a T-B-NK+ radiation-sensitive phenotype of SCID or
CID, similar to RAG-1/RAG-2 deﬁciency. For milder cases treatment with
IVIg may be enough. High risk of lymphoma.

T-B + NK +SCID

DNA-PKcs deﬁciency
One child with T-B-NK+ SCID with radiation sensitivity has been shown
to have a mutation in DNA-PKcs preventing its binding to Artemis. This
mutation is also reported in horses and dogs, who develop SCID with
opportunistic infections.

T-B+NK+SCID: Jak-3 kinase deﬁciency,
common gamma-chain deﬁciency, and
IL-7RA deﬁciency
Jak-3 kinase deﬁciency (autosomal recessive
T-B+NK+ SCID)
This form, in which T cells are absent but B cells are present in normal
numbers, accounts for about 10% of all cases of SCID.
Cause
• Mutations in the gene encoding Jak-3 kinase (19p12-13.1), which
prevent signalling through the surface cytokine receptors containing
the common gamma chain. Signals from IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, IL-15, and
IL-21 are blocked.
• T-cell but not B-cell differentiation is blocked.
Presentation
• Presents with typical SCID features.
• Mild cases occur, presenting later with increased infections but not SCID.
• May also present with lymphoproliferative disease (compound
heterozygote).
Diagnosis
• Typical SCID presentation or high index of suspicion.
• Absent T cells with normal or increased B and decreased NK cells;
overall total lymphocyte count may be normal.
• Western blotting of lymphocyte lysates may identify the absence of
Jak-3 protein and genetic studies will conﬁrm the gene defect.
Immunology
• T cells are very low or absent; NK cells are reduced; B cells are
normal or increased; absent mitogenic responses.
• Mild variants may exist with signiﬁcant numbers of poorly functioning
T cells.
• Hypogammaglobulinaemia is usual.
Treatment
• Gene therapy has been attempted, but immune reconstitution was not
achieved.

35

36

CHAPTER 1

Primary immunodeﬁciency

Common gamma-chain deﬁciency (X-linked
T-B+NK+ SCID)
This accounts for 50-60% of SCID.
Cause
• Mutations in the common cytokine receptor gamma chain; signals from
IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, IL-15, and IL-21 are blocked.
• Gene is located at Xq13.1-13.3.
• Missense mutations may lead to the expression of a mutant nonfunctional gamma chain.
Presentation
• Typical SCID features in male infant.
Diagnosis
• Pattern of infections.
• Low/absent T cells, NK cells; normal or increased B cells.
• Demonstration of absent common gamma-chain and genetic
mutations. As levels of common gamma chain on lymphocytes are low,
demonstration of absence is difﬁcult, and may be confused if there is MFE.
• Flow cytometry can be used to identify the absence of the common
gamma chain.
• Functional STAT5 phosphorylation assay, using ﬂow cytometry to
detect tyrosine phosphoryklated STAT5, after stimulation with IL-2,
can distinguish between JAK-3 and XL-SCID.
Immunology
• Low serum immunoglobulins.
• Normal or increased B cells; low/absent T cells and NK cells
(dependent on IL-15).
• Poor mitogen responsivness. B cells may make IgE in vitro via a
common gamma-chain-independent IL-4 receptor.

Interleukin-7 receptor-α deﬁciency
Accounts for 1-2% of SCID patients.
Cause
• Autosomal recessive mutation in IL-7RA.
• Gene is located at 5p13.
• Missense mutations may lead to the expression of a mutant nonfunctional protein that binds IL-7 poorly.
Presentation
• Typical SCID features in infant.
Diagnosis
• Pattern of infections.
• Low/absent T cells, normal or increased B cells, and normal NK-cell
numbers.
• Demonstration of absent IL-7RA and genetic mutations. Should be
sought in atypical cases of B+ SCID, not accounted for by Jak-3 and
common gamma-chain mutations.

SCID: ZAP-70 KINASE DEFICIENCY

Immunology
• Low serum immunoglobulins.
• Normal or increased B cells, low/absent T cells, and normal NK cells.
• Poor mitogen responsiveness.

SCID: ZAP-70 kinase deﬁciency
ZAP-70 kinase deﬁciency
This is a rare cause of autosomal recessive SCID.
Cause
• Autosomal recessive mutation in CD3 zeta-associated protein, ZAP70.
• Gene is located at 2q12.
• Mutations cluster in region of gene encoding the site for enzymatic
activity.
• ZAP-70 is involved in signal transduction from the membrane CD3
complex to the internal cascade.
• ZAP-70 is crucial in thymic development, especially in the
development of CD8+ T cells from double-positive precursors.
Presentation
• Typical SCID features in infancy, with (usually) an early presentation.
• Later presentation with mild CID phenotype may occur.
• Inﬂamatory bowel disease and autoimmune cytopenia have been
described.
• Omenn-like and HLH syndromes may occur.
• Lymph nodes and thymic shadow may be present.
Diagnosis
• Pattern of infections.
• Characteristic selective absence of circulating CD8+ T cells.
• Demonstration of absence of ZAP-70.
• Thymic biopsy may show double-positive cells in the cortex but only
CD4+ T cells in the medulla.
Immunology
• Serum immunoglobulins may be normal.
• Normal or increased B cells, absent CD8+ T cells, normal/low CD4+ T
cells, and normal NK cells.
• Failure of response to membrane-acting mitogens, PHA, and anti-CD3
monoclonal antibodies, with normal responses to phorbol esters and
ionophores (acting at the level of protein kinase C).
Treatment
• Gene therapy may be possible.
• Otherwise treat as for SCID.

37

38

CHAPTER 1

Primary immunodeﬁciency

SCID: purine metabolic disorders:
ADA and PNP deﬁciencies
Adenosine deaminase (ADA) deﬁciency
This is the ﬁrst genetically identiﬁed cause of SCID. It accounts for 20%
of cases of SCID.
Cause
• Mutations in the ADA gene on chromosome 20q13.11. This gene has
now been cloned and sequenced.
• Gene product is involved in purine metabolism.
• In the absence of ADA, there is a progressive reduction of
T and B cells because of the toxic effects of dATP and S-adenosyl
homocysteine, with increased lymphocyte apoptosis.
Presentation
• Typical SCID features in infancy, with (usually) an early presentation.
• Liver enzymes are often raised.
• There is abnormal ﬂaring of the rib ends, pelvic dysplasia, and
neurological features, including cortical blindness.
• Presentation with mild form in adult life has been reported.
Presentation is with recurrent bacterial infections and opportunist
infections such as PCP; evidence of immune dysregulation
(autoimmunity and allergy).
• Lymphoma is a complication for late presenters.
• Relatives may show reduced levels of red cell ADA activity.
• Lymphocytes may be normal at birth (due to maternal ADA), but fall
rapidly after delivery.
Diagnosis
• Pattern of infections (in early childhood); diagnosis of adults may be
difﬁcult.
• Lymphopenia.
• Bone changes are not speciﬁc, although suggestive in the context of
the immunological abnormalities.
• Measurement of ADA in erythrocytes, together with serum levels
of toxic metabolites is essential (Purine Research Laboratory, Guy’s
Hospital, London).
Immunology
• Serum immunoglobulins may be normal initially, but fall rapidly.
• Progressive severe lymphopenia, affecting all cell types.
• Poor/absent responses to all mitogens.
Treatment
• HSCT is treatment of choice, as for other types of SCID.
• Red cell transfusions restore ADA levels and improve immune
function; PEG-ADA is available and is highly effective in restoring
immune function (although this makes HSCT harder!).

SCID: PURINE METABOLIC DISORDERS

• Antibodies to PEG-ADA may occur.
• Gene therapy has been used successfully, but has been complicated
in several cases by acute leukaemia due to insertion of the retroviral
vector into known oncogenes. Therefore gene therapy has been
suspended.

SCID: purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) deﬁciency
This is a rare genetic deﬁciency of another purine metabolic enzyme, PNP,
which leads to a combined immune deﬁciency of slower onset than ADA
deﬁciency.
Cause
• Absence of PNP leads to a build-up of the toxic metabolite dGTP,
which preferentially damages T cells in the early stages, but later
damages B cells also.
• Disease is autosomal recessive; gene is located at 14q13.1.
• Disease is rare (about 50 cases worldwide).
Presentation
• Onset tends to be later than for other forms of SCID, and in this
respect it behaves more as a combined immunodeﬁciency.
• Neurological signs (spasticity, tremor, ataxia, and mental retardation)
occur early.
• Infections are common, especially disseminated varicella, but also
other bacterial, viral, and opportunist pathogens.
• Haemolytic anaemia, ITP, and thyroiditis are also common.
Diagnosis
• Combination of progressive neurological signs and infections should
raise suspicion.
• A low serum urate is a useful marker.
• Diagnosis is made by enzymatic studies and by detection of elevated
levels of the metabolite dGTP (Purine Research Laboratory, Guy’s
Hospital, London).
Immunology
• Immunoglobulins are normal or low, but some patients have elevated
levels with monoclonal gammopathies.
• Poor speciﬁc antibody responses to immunization.
• Autoantibodies may be detected.
• B cells are normal in number until late disease, but there is a
progressive decrease in T-cell numbers with time.
• Mitogen responses are variably reduced.
Treatment
• Optimum treatment is unknown, owing to the rarity of the condition.
BMT or HSCT is probably best (11 patients worldwide, 4 successful),
although gene therapy is a future possibility.

39

40

CHAPTER 1

Primary immunodeﬁciency

SCID: MHC class I deﬁciency
(bare lymphocyte syndrome type I)
This is a rare cause of combined immunodeﬁciency (12 cases reported).

Cause
• Deﬁciency of either TAP-1 or TAP-2 (transporter associated with
antigen presentation).
• Causes unstable peptide/MHC class I/B2MG complex, which rapidly
dissociates and cannot be expressed on the cell surface.

Presentation
•
•
•
•
•

Recurrent bacterial sinopulmonary infections.
Granulomatous skin lesions, with ulceration.
Presentation at any age.
SCID like presentation in early life may occur.
May be asymptomatic.

Diagnosis
• Symptoms plus failure of class I expression on cells.

Immunology
• Minor abnormalities of humoral immunity only.
• Lymphocyte subsets may be normal; abnormalities when present are
minor and inconsistent.

Treatment
• Unsatisfactory; chest and sinus disease treated similarly to cystic
ﬁbrosis with aggressive antibiotics and physiotherapy.
• Skin disease is difﬁcult to treat: immunosuppressive therapy and
interferons may make the condition worse.
• Role of HSCT undeﬁned (but class I expression occurs on all
nucleated cells, so this is not a pure stem cell disorder).

SCID: MHC class II deﬁciency (bare
lymphocyte syndrome type II)
This rare disease is found predominantly in North Africa and the
Mediterranean area (80 cases worldwide). It is autosomal recessive, but
genetically complex.

Cause
• Mutations can occur in any of the following transcription factors:
CIITA (16p13), RFX-5 (1q21.1-21.3), RFXAP, (13q14) RFXANK (19p12,
most common).
• Patients with CIITA have normal expression of regulatory factor X
(RFX), while the other defects do not.

OTHER RARE FORMS OF SCID/CID

Presentation
• Presentation is usually early (ﬁrst 6 months of age) with severe
diarrhoea, hypogammaglobulinaemia, and malabsorption.
• Recurrent bacterial and viral chest infections.
• Viral infections of the nervous system (HSV, enteroviruses).
• Haemolytic anaemia.
• Hepatitis, cholangitis.
• Rarely, it is asymptomatic.

Diagnosis
• Diagnosis is made on clinical suspicion (differential diagnosis
includes IPEX syndrome (see X-linked immune dysregulation with
polyendocrinopathy syndrome (IPEX) due to FOXP3 deﬁciency,
p.54)).
• Absence of MHC class II expression on lymphocytes.

Immunology
• Immunoglobulins are normal or low.
• B-cell numbers are normal; T-cell numbers may be normal but there
may be low CD4+ T cells and increased CD8+ T cells, reversing the
normal ratio.
• MHC class I expression is variable.
• MHC class II expression will be absent (DR, DP, DQ) but may be
inducible with G-IFN.
• Poor but variable mitogen responses.

Treatment
• BMT/HSCT is the treatment of choice, but is surprisingly difﬁcult to do
successfully.

SCID: reticular dysgenesis (adenylate
kinase 2 (AK2) deﬁciency)
This is a rare defect of the maturation of stem cells for both lymphoid and
myeloid lineages caused by mutations in the gene for adenylate kinase 2
(AK2), a mitochondrial enzyme. There is marked granulocytopenia, lymphopenia, and thrombocytopenia (sometimes no cells at all!). It presents
with early overwhelming infections and often death before the diagnosis is
made. MFE is common. HSCT is required.

Other rare forms of SCID/CID
Nezelof’s syndrome
Mainly a T-cell deﬁciency, with no identiﬁed molecular cause(s), presenting with recurrent sinopulmonary and gastrointestinal infections and malabsorption, warts, allergic disease autoimmunity (haemolytic anaemia, ITP,
neutropenia, hepatitis). Unclear whether this is a discrete diagnostic entity

41

42

CHAPTER 1

Primary immunodeﬁciency

or represents early-onset CVID. T lymphopenia, variably reduced immunoglobulin levels, poor humoral function, autoantibodies. Prognosis seems
to be poor despite prophylactic antibiotics, antifungals, and IVIg: BMT/
HSCT suggested.

CD3 ζ-chain deﬁciency
Presented as T-B+NK+ SCID; partial deﬁciency has also been reported with
CID and coeliac disease and autoimmune disease.

CD3 deﬁciency
Deﬁciencies of CD3 G-, D-, and ε-chains have been described in small
numbers of patients; there is variable expression of CD3. Cases present
as severe CID, recurrent sinopulmonary infections, and autoimmune phenomena. Reduced expression of the CD3 complex on T cells is suspicious;
proliferative responses to mitogenic anti-CD3 monoclonal antibodies are
absent, but responses to phorbol esters and ionophore are normal. CD3δdeﬁcient patients have markedly reduced T cells. BMT/HSCT is probably
the treatment of choice. IVIg is helpful in mild cases.

CD25 (IL-2 receptor-A) deﬁciency
Three patients now reported with this condition, but presentations are
variable. Single patient reported presenting with severe T lymphopenia and
diffuse lymphocyte inﬁltrates associated with mutation in CD25 gene—
similar in presentation to autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (see
Autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndromes (ALPS; Canale-Smith syndrome), p.57). Recurrent viral, bacterial, and opportunist infections occur.
One patient had phenotype similar to IPEX syndrome (see p.54), but had
defective IL-10 production (unlike FOXP3 deﬁciency).

CD45 deﬁciency
Two cases presenting with SCID-like illness due to complete absence of
surface CD45 caused by mutations in the CD45 gene 1q31-q32.

P56lck deﬁciency
Three cases: one presenting early with infections, panhypogammaglobulinaemia, reduced CD4+ T cells, and poor responses to surface-acting
mitogens. May be a cause of idiopathic CD4+ T cell lymphopenia or mimic
CVID. Suggested treatment is IVIg and antibiotics; HSCT in one case
unsuccessful.

Actin-regulating protein coronin 1A deﬁciency
Coronin 1 (CORO1A, 16p11.2) is involved in the correct formation of the
actin cytoskeleton. It appears to be important in T-cell emigration from
the thymus. Mutations in CORO1A lead to absence of peripheral T cells
and a SCID phenotype, but with a normally developed thymus.

DOCK8 deﬁciency
• Dedicator of cytokinesis 8 (DOCK8) deﬁciency (autosomal recessive)
has been associated in a number of families with a combined
immunodeﬁciency, with features similar to the hyper-IgE syndrome
(see p.26).

OTHER RARE FORMS OF SCID/CID

• Patients had recurrent upper and lower respiratory tract infections,
severe herpes zoster or simplex, persistent molluscum contagiosum,
HPV infection.
• Severe atopic disease and anaphylaxis, with raised IgE and eosinophilia
was present in most patients.
• Squamous cell carcinoma and lymphoma occurred.
• Immunoglobulins were reduced; T and B cell numbers were low.

Late-onset combined immune deﬁciency (LOCID)
A small subset of patients with CVID are recognized who go on to develop
opportunist infections, more typical of a combined immune deﬁciency.
Often from consanguineous families. CD4+ T cells usually <200x106/L, with
decreased naive T cells and B cells. Increased incidence of splenomegaly, granulomata, and lymphoma. At present no genetic lesion has been identiﬁed.

Winged helix nude phenotype, FOXN1 (whn mutation)
One Italian family with complete alopecia and SCID-like syndrome
reported, associated with winged-helix nude mutation, similar to nude
mouse. Thymic function impaired. Reduced CD4+ T cells. T-cell proliferative function reduced. One patient successfully received HSCT.

STAT5b deﬁciency
Patients present with growth hormone insensitivity, short stature, skin
problems (eczema, ichthyosis), recurrent chest infections, Pneumocystis
and viral infections (severe herpes zoster and simplex). Deﬁciency of
STAT5b impairs signalling via receptors for IL-2, IL-4, CSF-1, and growth
hormone. CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells are reduced.

Calcium ﬂux defects
Mutations in the genes ORAI1/CRACM1 (calcium-release-activated calcium modulator 1), involved in calcium channels, and STIM1 (stromal
interaction molecule 1), which senses calcium release, affect lymphocyte
activation. Both mutations lead to autosomal recessive immunodeﬁciency
with increased susceptibility to bacterial and viral infections. Lymphocyte
counts are slightly reduced; immunoglobulin levels are normal but with
poor T-cell proliferative responses and poor speciﬁc antibody responses.
Ectodermal defects (teeth) and hypotonia occur. Lymphoproliferative disease occurs. Treatment is by HSCT.

CD8 deﬁciency
Single symptomatic patient described with homozygous mutation in CD8α
chain (2p12). Presented with recurrent bacterial infections of chest and sinuses.
CD8+ T cells completely absent. 2 sisters had same defect but were asymptomatic (parents consanguineous). Presents later than ZAP-70 deﬁciency.

Other rare defects
•
•
•
•
•

CD7 T-cell deﬁciency.
Autosomal SCID with multiple intestinal atresias.
Multiple cytokine deﬁciency.
Lack of nuclear factor of activated T cells (NF-AT).
IL-2 deﬁciency: presented as SCID; no transcription of IL-2.

T-cell disorder
• DiGeorge syndrome:
• including all the variants—CATCH-22 (see DiGeorge (22q11
deletion complex) syndrome, p.44).
• Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome:
• also includes X-linked thrombocytopenia and GATA-1 deﬁciency.

• STAT1 deﬁciency.

DiGeorge (22q11 deletion complex)
syndrome
DiGeorge originally described one phenotype of what is now realized to
be a broad and complex array of developmental defects, probably due to
more than one genetic lesion.
The range of defects is large and includes the CATCH-22 syndrome
(cardiac abnormalities, abnormal facies, thymic hypoplasia, cleft palate, and hypocalcaemia, associated with 22q11 deletions), Shprintzen
syndrome, velocardiofacial syndrome (VCF), cono-truncal face anomaly
syndrome, Opitz G/BBB syndrome, CHARGE (coloboma, heart defect,

DIGEORGE (22Q11 DELETION COMPLEX) SYNDROME

atresia choanae, retarded growth and development, genital hypoplasia, ear
anomalies/deafness) associations, Kallman syndrome, and arrhinencephaly/
holoporencephaly. Similar features may also arise in the fetal alcohol syndrome, maternal diabetes, and retinoid embryopathy.

Cause
• Microdeletions at 22q11, possibly affecting a zinc-ﬁnger (DNA-binding)
protein involved in early development, have been associated with
many of the phenotypic variants.
• Candidate genes include the transcription factor TBX1 (van Gogh
mutation in zebraﬁsh!), CRKL (mouse knockout, not reported in
humans), and UFD1L.
• Other mutations, including 10p deletions, may give a similar phenotype.
• CHARGE syndrome has been associated with mutations in the CHD7
(chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 7) gene located at
8q12.1; multiple mutations have been identiﬁed with no genotype-
phenotype correlation. These mutations tend to be sporadic rather
than familial (as in 22q11 syndromes).
• Abnormal development of branchial-arch-derived structures, including
heart, thymus, and parathyroid glands.

Presentation
• Hypocalcaemic tetany, often occurring in ﬁrst 48 hours after delivery,
due to maldevelopment of parathyroid gland.
• Cardiac abnormalities, typically those of a truncus arteriosus type,
interrupted aortic arch, or tetralogy of Fallot. Severity of the cardiac
abnormalities often determines outcome.
• Dysmorphic face with cleft palate, low-set ears, and ﬁsh-shaped mouth.
• Highly variable immunodeﬁciency associated with absence or
reduction of thymic size; this often improves with age.
• Severe forms may present as SCID with absent T cells (1% of cases).
• Partial syndromes may occur without any immunological features (VCF
and Shprintzen syndromes).
• Infections are mainly viral (adenovirus, CMV, rotavirus).
• GvHD from non-irradiated blood transfusions may occur if the
diagnosis is not considered during surgery for cardiac abnormalities.
• Increased risk of autoimmune disease and B-cell lymphomas.
• 10% have cleft palates.
• Development delay common, especially language.

Diagnosis
• Diagnosis is by clinical suspicion, based on the facial features, typical
cardiac abnormalities, and abnormally low calcium in full-blown cases.
Partial variants may be more difﬁcult to identify.
• All children with relevant cardiac abnormalities should be screened
for 22q11 deletions by FISH and for other cytogenetic abnormalities.
If positive, screen parents and refer for genetic counselling (50% of
subsequent pregnancies will be affected).

45

46

CHAPTER 1

Primary immunodeﬁciency

• Patients with an identiﬁed 22q11 deletion should be screened for
immunological defects, both humoral and cellular (immunoglobulins,
IgG subclasses, speciﬁc antibodies, lymphocyte surface markers, and
proliferation assays).

Immunology
• Immunology is highly variable and tends to improve with age; extrathymic development of T cells may occur.
• SCID-like immunology is possible.
• Variable reduction in T cells, with normal or low T-cell proliferation to
mitogens.
• Immunoglobulins may be normal or reduced, and speciﬁc antibody
production may be poor with low/absent immunization responses.
• Deﬁciency of IgA increased, and associated with autoimmunity.
• CHARGE syndrome associated with reduced CD4+ and CD8+ T cells
and near-absent T cells in a few cases. Poor proliferative responses
to mitogens. NK and B cell numbers usually normal. Variable
immunoglobulin levels but poor vaccine responses.
• TRECs analysis gives an idea of thymic output.
• Tcr Vβ analysis may also be abnormal.

Treatment
• Optimum treatment is uncertain: the cardiac abnormalities deﬁne
prognosis and repair of these takes priority.
• Irradiated blood should be used until the severity of the immunological
abnormality is known. Children with normal T-cell function are
probably at very low risk of developing transfusion-related GvHD.
• Calcium supplementation for hypoparathyroidism.
• As mild immune defects may improve, simple measures such as
prophylactic antibiotics may be all that is required. If there is evidence
of signiﬁcant humoral deﬁciency, IVIg may be required
• Severe defects, with absent T cells, should be considered for BMT/
HSCT, although in the absence of a thymus it is probable that
reconstitution is due to engraftment of mature T cells.
• Thymic transplants (inserted into muscle peripherally) have been tried
and are said to be of value.
• Long-term monitoring for the development of autoimmune disease
and hearing disorders, and support for learning difﬁculties.
• Adolescents and adults may be more at risk of developing major
depression and schizophrenia.
• Surgery may be required for palatal defects.
• The safety of vaccination with live vaccines has not been fully evaluated
in controlled trials, but may be considered if:
• CD8+ T cells >0.3x109/L
• CD4+ T cells >0.5x109/L
• proliferative responses to mitogens normal.
• Long-term maintenance of immunity may be worse than in healthy
individuals.

WAS, XLT AND XLN

Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS),
X-linked thrombocytopenia (XLT) and
X-linked neutropenia (XLN)
Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome is an X-linked disorder causing thrombocytopenia with small platelets, eczema, and a progressive immune deﬁciency.
The same gene is also responsible for X-linked thrombocytopenia, a
milder variant in which the eczema and immune deﬁciency are absent, and
X-linked neutropenia.

Cause
• X-linked disease; the gene is located at Xp11.23 encoding WASP
(Wiskott-Aldrich-associated protein). The same gene is responsible
for X-linked thrombocytopenia.
• WASP is a multifunctional protein, with GTPase binding activity. It is
involved in intracellular actin polymerization, intracellular signalling,
apoptosis, and phagocytosis.
• Carrier females show non-random X inactivation, indicating that
WASP expression carries a selective advantage in cell development.
• Abnormal O-glycosylation of surface proteins of both lymphocytes
and platelets is well described. One such surface antigen is CD43
(sialoglycophorin). However, the gene for CD43 is normal in WAS.
N-linked glycosylation is normal.
• Gain-of-function mutations in the GTPase (cdc42) binding domain of
WASp impair the autoinhibitory ability of the molecule and increase
actin polymerization, causing a mild congenital neutropenia. These
patients also have lymphocyte abnormalities with poor lymphocyte
proliferation response to anti-CD3.

Presentation
• Presentation is in early childhood in males with severe eczema, which
has an atypical distribution compared with atopic eczema. Molluscum
contagiosum, warts, and HSV may infect eczematous skin.
• Abnormal bleeding is due to the low platelet count, and bleeding
complications occur early.
• Infections develop more gradually, usually affecting the respiratory
tract, and are bacterial.
• Opportunist infections: Pneumocystis, disseminated molluscum
contagiosum, papillomavirus, systemic varicella, herpes simplex, and
CMV. Fungal infections are uncommon, and are mainly Candida.
• Autoimmunity (vasculitis and glomerulonephritis) is well described:
• vasculitic aneurysms may occur
• inﬂammatory bowel disease.
• Allergic reactions to food may occur.
• There is often a family history.
• XLT, a mild variant with thrombocytopenia alone, but without eczema
and immune deﬁciency is recognized.

47

48

CHAPTER 1

Primary immunodeﬁciency

• Two forms of WAS exist: a severe form culminating in early
lymphoma, and a milder form compatible with survival to adult life.
There is no phenotype-genotype correlation.
• Symptomatic female carriers have been reported (skewed
X-inactivation).
• XLN patients present with mild congenital neutropenia.

Diagnosis
• Clinical features: there is thrombocytopenia (variable in range <-70)
with abnormally small platelet volume (<6.0ﬂ is diagnostic).
• Identiﬁcation of low/absent WASP with subsequent mutation analysis
is required.
• No absolutely diagnostic immunological features.
• Prenatal diagnosis is possible.

Immunology
• There is a progressive reduction of T cells with poor proliferative
responses to CD3, CD43, and periodate (speciﬁc for O-linked sugars).
Proliferation to galactose oxidase and neuraminidase, which act via
N-linked sugars, is normal.
• There is reduced IgM and IgA with a normal or high IgG and elevated
IgE. There is a progressive loss of antipolysaccharide responses
(including isohaemagglutinins) with poor/absent responses to test
immunization with polysaccharide antigens. B-cell numbers are normal.
• CD43 (sialophorin) on lymphocytes and gpIb on platelets are unstable
and tend to fall off cells when they are kept in vitro. Abnormalities of
the cytoskeleton in T cells and platelets, with failure of actin bundling,
have also been described.
• Variable thymic hypoplasia.

Treatment
• Splenectomy may be beneﬁcial for thrombocytopenia, which is
usually resistant to steroids. XLT patients are highly susceptible to
overwhelming sepsis if splenectomy is undertaken, even though
normally they do not have a problem with infection.
• Platelet transfusions should be avoided unless essential to control
bleeding. Ensure that blood products are from CMV- donors.
• IVIg should be used for patients with poor antipolysaccharide
responses if recurrent bacterial infections are a problem and after
splenectomy, as responses to post-splenectomy vaccination schedules
will be poor.
• Consider prophylactic antibiotics; mandatory post-splenectomy.
Prophylactic aciclovir for HSV.
• Treat eczema.
• Avoid aspirin and related drugs (increased risk of bleeding).
• Rituximab may be required for autoimmune complications.
• Early (<5 years of age) BMT/HSCT should be considered to prevent
the development of lymphoma; it cures all the features of the disease,
including eczema.

ATAXIA TELANGIECTASIA

• The role of BMT/HSCT in adult patients is unclear. Development of
lymphoma is an indication for aggressive chemotherapy followed by
transplantation in ﬁrst remission, with matched unrelated donor for
the graft-versus-lymphoma effect.
• Gene therapy is undergoing clinical trials, and 2 patients treated in this
way have shown marked clinical improvements.

Outcome
• Death may occur from infection or intracranial haemorrhage.
• Very signiﬁcant risk of death in late adolescence/early adulthood from
high-grade lymphoreticular malignancy, usually EBV+. This may be
preventable by early HSCT.
• Mild variants exist and may have fewer problems with bleeding or
infection in adulthood.
• XLT life expectancy appears to be near normal.
• XLN patients are at increased risk of developing myelodysplasia.

Ataxia telangiectasia
Cause
• Cells from AT patients have a disorder of the cell cycle checkpoint
pathway, resulting in extreme sensitivity to ionizing radiation.
Lymphocytes show frequent chromosomal breaks, inversions, and
translocations; the major sites affected are the genes for the T-cell
receptors and the Ig heavy chains.
• Disease is autosomal recessive; six genetic complementation groups
(A, B, C, D, E, V1, V2) have been described and all but V2 map to
11q22-23.
• One of the genes has now been identiﬁed and is a DNA-dependent
kinase related to phosphatidylinositol kinase-3 (ataxia telangiectasia
mutated protein (ATM)). Function appears to be to sense doublestranded DNA breaks.
• ATM phosphorylates BRCA1 (may explain increased risk of breast
cancer in carrier females).

Presentation
• Progressive cerebellar ataxia, with typical telangiectasia, especially of
the ear lobes and conjunctivae.
• Accompanied by recurrent bacterial sinopulmonary infections.
• Opportunist infections uncommon, but extensive warts are not
unusual.

Diagnosis
• Clinical history is usually diagnostic, although the disease may be
difﬁcult to identify in the early stage when signs are minimal.
• A-Fetoprotein in serum is usually raised.

49

50

CHAPTER 1

Primary immunodeﬁciency

• Genetic testing is difﬁcult because of the large size of the gene and the
lack of clustering of the mutations.
• Spontaneous cytogenetic abnormalities occur, and will be increased by
radiation exposure.

Immunology
• Immunoglobulins are variable: there is often a reduction of IgG2/
IgG4, IgA, and IgE, with poor antipolysaccharide responses. There is an
increased incidence of autoantibodies.
• T-cell numbers and function are usually reduced.

Treatment
• No treatment is effective in what is a relentless disease with
progressive neurological deterioration.
• PEG feeding may be required in the later stages, when bulbar function
deteriorates, to prevent recurrent aspiration.
• IVIg reduces the incidence of infections and improves quality of life but
does not affect the outcome.
• Minimize radiation exposure.

Outcome
• Ataxia is progressive and patients become wheelchair-bound early
(late teens, early twenties).
• High incidence of malignancy, especially high-grade lymphoma, and
the incidence of malignancy is raised in other family members (ﬁvefold
increase in breast cancer).
• Death usually ensues in early adult life and is caused by infections or
neoplasia.
• Heterozygotes for abnormal ATM genes may have an increased risk of
chronic lymphocytic leukaemia.

Other chromosomal instability
disorders
Ataxia-telangiectasia-like disorder (ATLD)
An AT-like disorder, without telangiectasia, has been identiﬁed linked to
MRE11A, a gene at 11q21, which is also involved with ATM in DNA repair.
A-fetoprotein and serum immunoglobulin levels are normal. Patients are
radiosensitive. Rate of neurodegeneration is slower than AT.

Ataxia-ocular apraxia type 1 (AOA1)
This is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by cerebellar ataxia,
oculomotor apraxis, and a sensorimotor neuropathy; telangiectasia is
absent. It is caused by mutations in the APTX gene coding for aprataxin.
Muscle co-enzyme Q10 may be deﬁcient; there is hypolbuminaemia and
raised cholesterol.

OTHER CHROMOSOMAL INSTABILITY DISORDERS

Ataxia-ocular apraxia type 2 (AOA2)
This is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by cerebellar ataxia,
variable oculomotor apraxia, and sensorimotor neuropathy. It is caused by
mutations in the SETX gene on chromosome 9q34 coding for senataxin,
an RNA and DNA helicase. There is no radiosensitivity. α-fetoprotein
levels are increased.

Nijmegen breakage and Seemanova syndromes
• These are syndromes of severe microcephaly, mental retardation (not
in the Seemanova syndrome), bird-like face, and recurrent infections.
• Increased chromosomal sensitivity to ionizing radiation.
• Gene has been identiﬁed on chromosome 8q21, encoding a protein
nibrin (NBS1) involved in DNA repair.
• Nibrin associates with MRE11 (see ATLD) and RAD50, deﬁciency of
which has been reported to cause a similar syndrome.
• Most patients have reduced/absent immunoglobulins and lymphopenia.
• T-cell responses to mitogens are poor.
• Cytogenetic analysis shows chromosomal abnormalities; the most
commonly involved chromosomes are 7 and 14, where the Ig and Tcr
genes are located.
• Thymus is dysplastic.
• Malignancy is increased (lymphoma, neural tumours), and is the major
cause of death.
• There is no speciﬁc treatment.

Bloom’s syndrome
• Autosomal recessive syndrome most common in Ashkenazi Jews.
• Gene located at 15q26.1, coding for the BLM protein, a RecQ helicase,
which maintains the stability of DNA when duplexes are unwound.
• Presents with marked sun sensitivity, short stature, patchy vitiligo,
infertility, immunodeﬁciency, and very high incidence of cancer.
• Early in childhood vomiting and diarrhoea can lead to severe dehydration.
• Immunodeﬁciency is characterized by low IgM, normal or poor speciﬁc
antibody responses, poor T-cell function, poor B-cell IgM production,
and NK-cell defects.
• Malignancy is the major complication and is difﬁcult to treat because of
the inability to repair DNA damage.
• Carriers do not seem to have an increased cancer risk.
• Immunoglobulin replacement is helpful, together with prompt
antibiotic treatment.
• Regular screening for cancer is essential.

Fanconi anaemia
• This is an autosomal recessive disease with chromosomal breaks.
• Seven genes (FANCA-FANCG) have been identiﬁed, on different
chromosomes, with eight different complementation groups.
• There are multiple organ defects, bone marrow failure (pancytopenia),
radial hypoplasia, abnormal face, and leukaemic transformation.
• Presentation is usually with short stature, abnormalities of
pigmentation, and organ defects.

51

52

CHAPTER 1

Primary immunodeﬁciency

• Decreased T and NK cells, increased IgE, low IgA, and poor
responses to polysaccharides have been reported, but immunological
abnormalities are not a major feature.

ICF (immunodeﬁciency-centromeric instability-abnormal
facies)
• Caused by abnormalities of chromosomes 1, 9, and 16.
• A gene has been identiﬁed, DNMT3B, involved in DNA methylation.
• Presents with dysmorphic face, mental retardation, and malabsorption
with failure to thrive.
• Immunodeﬁciency occurs in all patients and is mainly humoral with
severe hypogammaglobulinaemia, but T-cell numbers are usually
reduced. In vitro functional tests of T cells are usually normal.

Cockayne syndrome
A disorder of nucleotide excision and repair associated with extreme sun
sensitivity. Associated with mutations in the genes ERCC6 or ERCC8. Not
normally associated with immunological abnormalities.

Trichothiodystrophy
Similar to Cockayne syndrome.

Xeroderma pigmentosa
Extreme sun sensitivity leading to bullae, keratoses, and squamous cell carcinoma are the features of this syndrome, which is a DNA repair defect.
Multiple genes can cause the phenotype. There is an immunodeﬁciency
with low CD4+ T cells and poor in vitro and in vivo T-cell function in some
patients; low IgG levels may also occur.

DNA ligase I deﬁciency
A single patient reported with short stature, sun sensitivity, low IgG,
absent IgA, poor speciﬁc antibody responses, and death from lymphoma.
The genetic defect was identiﬁed as DNA ligase I deﬁciency.

Chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis
(CMC) syndromes
Multiple syndromes, presenting with mucocutaneous candidiasis; rarely
with invasive candidiasis. Often in association with endocrinopathy.

Cause
• Cause of many cases of CMC is unknown.
• Cytokine abnormalities have been documented.
• Autosomal dominant and recessive forms as well as sporadic cases are
all documented.
• AIRE on chromosome 21 (21q22.3) is abnormal in autoimmune
polyglandular syndrome type I (APECED (autoimmune
polyendocrinopathy-candidiasis-ectodermal dysplasia), see Chapter 4).

CHRONIC MUCOCUTANEOUS CANDIDIASIS (CMC) SYNDROMES

May be associated with autoantibodies to IL-17A, IL17F, and IL-22,
impairing Th17 cells.
• Gain-of-function STAT1 mutations (autosomal dominant CMC),
impairing IL-17, IL-22 and γ-IFN production, and impaired Th1 and
Th17 function by inibiting STAT3.
• CARD-9 (autosomal recessive CMC) impairs Dectin-1 signalling and
reduces Th17 cells
• Other mutations known to be associated with CMC-like illness
include:
• lymphoid phosphatase, lyp (protein tyrosine phosphatase nonreceptor type 22, PTPN22)
• Dectin-1 (C-type lectin receptor which enhances TLR2/TLR4
cytokine production) deﬁciency: causes mucosal but not invasive
candidiasis
• TLR3 L412F variant (dysfunctional receptor): candidiasis, nail
dystrophy and severe sinopulmonary infections, viral infections and
autoimmunity
• IL-12 p40/IL-12Rβ1 (also mycobacteria and salmonella)
• IL17F/IL17RA (also staphylococci).

Presentation
• Early onset of superﬁcial candidiasis affecting nails and mouth, and
occasionally the oesophagus; persistent; invasive candidiasis is very rare
and should raise questions of other diagnoses.
• May be a family history.
• May be associated with an endocrinopathy causing hypocalcaemia due
to parathyroid insufﬁciency, hypothyroidism, and adrenal insufﬁciency
(consider APECED).
• Other autoimmune phenomena may occur: vitiligo, alopecia, hepatitis,
pernicious anaemia.
• Increased susceptibility to bacterial infections (particularly of the
respiratory tract), tuberculosis, herpesviruses, and toxoplasmosis.
Severe forms may progress to a more generalized combined
immunodeﬁciency, similar to SCID.
• May be associated with thymoma.
• Autosomal dominant form presenting with CMC and cerebral
vasculitis similar to moyamoya disease (genetic basis unknown).

Diagnosis
• There is no unequivocal diagnostic test.
• In vivo and in vitro T-cell responses to Candida antigens are poor or
absent, but anti-Candida IgG antibodies are high.
• Acquired immunodeﬁciency and other risk factors for Candida
(diabetes, steroid inhalers, Sjögren’s syndrome, proton pump inhibitor
use) should be excluded.
• Presence of superﬁcial candidiasis with an endocrinopathy, either
overt or cryptic (autoantibody positive without symptoms), is highly
suspicious: AIRE gene should be checked.

53

54

CHAPTER 1

Primary immunodeﬁciency

Immunology
• Anti-Candida antibodies (IgG) are raised, often with multiple precipitin
lines on double diffusion tests.
• IgG2/IgG4 often reduced, and there are poor antipolysaccharide
responses with low immunization responses.
• Poor in vitro proliferation to Candida antigens, with abnormal cytokine
production (high IL-6). T-cell responses to mitogens are usually
normal. Cutaneous reactivity to Candida is absent, although other
DTH responses are often normal. T-lymphocyte subsets are usually
normal.
• Abnormal production of IL-17, IL-22, and γ-IFN.
• Reduced Th17 cells are a key feature.
• Autoantibodies may be detectable to endocrine organs (parathyroid,
adrenal, ovary, thyroid).
• Autoantibodies to IL-17 and IL-22 may be detectable.
• Mannan-binding lectin deﬁciency has been suggested as a cofactor.

Treatment
• Treatment is difﬁcult: Candida will respond well to antifungals
(ﬂuconazole or itraconazole) but inevitably relapses when the
antifungal is withdrawn. Resistance to these antifungals may occur.
Prolonged therapy is undesirable and increases the chances of
hepatotoxicy. Newer antifungals are voriconazole and caspafungin—
these should be used sparingly.
• Avoid the use of proton pump inhibitors as these increase the risk of
oesophageal candidiasis.
• IVIg should be considered for patients with recurrent bacterial
infections. Continuous antibiotics tend to exacerbate the candidiasis.
• G-IFN may have some beneﬁcial effect.
• HSCT should be considered for severe forms, but the procedure is
difﬁcult in heavily infected patients.
• Maintain regular surveillance for signiﬁcant endocrine disease, in
particular adrenal insufﬁciency, which may be insidious in its onset.
Treat endocrine disease normally.

Outcome
• CMC is not as benign as textbooks would have you believe!
• Patients may die from overwhelming sepsis, in addition to deaths from
unrecognized adrenal insufﬁciency.

X-linked immune dysregulation with
polyendocrinopathy syndrome (IPEX)
due to FOXP3 deﬁciency
An X-linked disorder characterized by severe endocrine autoimmunity,
diarrhoea, eczema, and serious infections.

IPEX DUE TO FOXP3 DEFICIENCY

Cause
• Gene defect identiﬁed as the FOXP3 gene, which is also responsible
for the scurfy phenotype in the mouse. The gene is close to WASP on
the X chromosome, Xp11.23.
• FOXP3 is a forkhead DNA-binding protein.
• Clinical phenotype has also been seen in patients without mutations in
FOXP3, indicating that other genes may also be involved.
• Patients are described with the phenotype but without mutations in
FOXP3 (IPEX-like syndrome); CD25 deﬁciency and STAT5b deﬁciency
may cause a similar syndrome.

Presentation
• Presentation early in life with severe watery diarrhoea and failure to
thrive.
• Severe eczema.
• Endocrine autoimmunity (early-onset diabetes mellitus, thyroid
disease).
• Autoimmune haemolytic anaemia, ITP, neutropenia, splenomegaly.
• Infections may include meningitis, osteomyelitis, and pneumonia.
• Interstitial nephritis in a third of patients.
• Rarely, interstitial lung disease.

Diagnosis
•
•
•
•

Clinical features.
Anaemia, thrombocytopenia.
Eosinophilia.
Multiple autoantibodies: TPO, islet cell, platelets, neutrophils,
erythrocytes (positive Coombs test).
• Enterocyte antibodies.
• Testing for Treg cells.
• Genetic testing is possible.

Immunology
• Markedly elevated IgE, with normal IgG, IgA, and IgM; normal speciﬁc
antibody responses.
• Raised IgE with allergen-speciﬁc IgE.
• Autoantibody to small bowel antigen AIE-75.
• T and B cells are usually normal.
• Reduced/absent regulatory T cells (Treg) by ﬂow cytometry
(CD4+CD25+FOXP3+).

Treatment
• BMT/HSCT, preferably before organ damage occurs.
• Control of endocrine disorder and attention to nutrition:
immunosuppression may be required (ciclosporin, tacrolimus,
sirolimus).
• Female carriers require genetic counselling.

55

56

CHAPTER 1

Primary immunodeﬁciency

OKT4 epitope deﬁciency
• In this condition, the epitope on the CD4 molecule recognized by the
monoclonal antibody OKT4 is absent.
• If OKT4 is used to identify T cells, CD4+ T cells will be spuriously
absent.
• The mutation appears not to affect CD4 and T-cell function.
• Occurs in 8.3% of Blacks; very rare in other racial groups.
• Most patients are asymptomatic.
• Heterozygotes have normal numbers of OKT4+ T cells, with a 50%
reduction in CD4 density on the surface when measured with OKT4.
• Recognition of this is important to prevent misdiagnosis as a severe
T-cell deﬁciency.

Idiopathic CD4+ T-cell lymphopenia
Initially recognized in adults presenting with AIDS-like opportunist infections but with no evidence of retroviral infection. Unclear whether this is a
discrete immunodeﬁciency or secondary to an unidentiﬁed pathogen.

Cause
• Unknown.
• Some cases associated with p56lck and CD45 abnormalities.
• Cases have been reported with deﬁcient expression of the chemokine
receptor CXCR4.

Presentation
• Presents with opportunist infections (PCP, Mycobacteria, Candida,
papillomavirus).
• Bacterial sepsis with unusual organisms.
• Increased incidence of lymphomas and autoimmune disease.
• Increased in IV drug users and haemophiliacs.
• May occur in children.

Diagnosis
• Pattern of opportunist infections in the absence of identiﬁed retroviral
infection.
• Reduced CD4+ T-cell numbers, with reduced CD45RA+ naive T cells.
Decreased CD127 expression.

Immunology
• Persistently reduced CD4+ T-cell numbers on more than one occasion;
OKT4 epitope deﬁciency excluded.
• CD8+ T cells may also be reduced—represents a poor prognostic factor.
• B-cell numbers may be reduced.
• Restricted Tcr repertoires.

Treatment
• Treat infections.
• IL-2 has been helpful in some cases.

AUTOIMMUNE LYMPHOPROLIFERATIVE SYNDROMES

• γ-IFN has also been used to reverse defective cytokine production and
treat cryptococcal meningitis.
• HSCT has been recommended in some cases.

Autoimmune lymphoproliferative
syndromes (ALPS, Canale-Smith
syndrome)
A series of disorders characterized by failure of apoptosis (programmed cell
death), leading to uncontrolled lymphoproliferation and autoimmunity.

Cause
Genetic defects have been identiﬁed in a number of genes controlling
apoptosis.
• Fas (TNFRSF6, CD95, APO-1), chromosome 10q24.1, ALPS Ia.
• Fas-ligand (TNFSF6, CD95L), ALPS Ib.
• Caspase 8 and Caspase 10, ALPS II.
• Somatic KRAS mutation (G13D) associated with ALPS-like phenotype,
without evidence of germline RAS mutations.
• No identiﬁed abnormality but typical phenotype, ALPS III.
• Penetrance of defects may be variable within families.

Presentation
• Occurs in males and females, but with skewing to males; usual onset in
childhood.
• Occasionally may be asymptomatic.
• Persistent splenomegaly, lymphadenopathy (typically neck),
hepatomegaly.
• Autoimmunity: haemolytic anaemia, ITP (made worse by
hyperspelenism), hepatitis, uveitis, Guillain-Barré syndrome.
• Increased incidence of lymphoma (Hodgkin’s > non-Hodgkin’s) and
other malignancies (carcinoma).

Diagnosis
• Unexplained lymphoproliferation with autoimmunity in a child is highly
suspicious.
• Lymphocytosis, often with eosinophilia in peripheral blood.
• Abnormal expression of Fas and Fas-ligand or caspases (genetic testing
is required but not widely available).
• Abnormal apoptosis assays (see Chapter 20).
• Histology of lymph nodes shows inﬁltration of double-negative T cells,
with no evidence of EBV.
• PET scanning may be valuable in identifying lymphadenopathy and
targeting biopsies.

Immunology
• Lymphocytosis, with increase in peripheral Tcrαβ+, CD45RA+
double-negative T cells (CD4-CD8-) >1% of total lymphocytes.

Primary immunodeﬁciency

Increase in Tcr γδ+ double-negative T cells.
Poor T-cell proliferative responses and abnormal apoptosis.
Increased CD5+ B cells; reduced CD27 expression.
Increased immunoglobulins.
Multiple autoantibodies.

Treatment
• Splenectomy may be required but increases risks of infection.
• Autoimmune disease may require treatment with corticosteroids and
immunosuppressive drugs (all available drugs have been tried!!).
• Rituximab has been used.
• Antimalarial drugs may be helpful (effects on TNF?).
• HSCT has been used successfully.

Outcome
• May improve spontaneously over time, with regression of
lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly.
• Increased risk of lymphoma.

Cartilage-hair hypoplasia (CHH)
syndrome
An autosomal recessive T-cell immunodeﬁciency associated with shortlimbed dwarﬁsm and distinctive ﬁne sparse hair.

Cause
• Autosomal recessive and linked to chromosome 9p21.
• Gene is ribonuclease mitochondrial RNA processing gene (RMRP),
involved in the metabolism of RNA primers.
• Occurs particularly in Finland and old-order Amish in the USA.
• Carrier frequency is 1 in 19 in old-order Amish.

Presentation
• Short-limbed skeletal dysplasia, with ﬁne sparse hair and ligamentous
laxity.
• Anaemia (macrocytic), neutropenia, ITP, other autoimmune diseases.
• Infections, especially varicella, are a problem in one-third. May rarely
present as SCID, with opportunist infections. Recurrent bacterial
infections may occur.
• Megacolon (aganglionic).
• Increased incidence of malignancy (non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma,
squamous cell carcinoma, basal cell carcinoma, and leukaemia).
• Phenotype is highly variable.

Diagnosis

• Typical radiographic appearances of joints, sparse hair, and macrocytic
anaemia.

WHIM SYNDROME

Immunology
• Immunology is variable.
• IgA ± IgG subclass deﬁciencies are reported.
• Neutropenia, together with T-cell lymphopenia. B-cell numbers may
be normal.
• Poor proliferative responses to mitogens.

Treatment
• IVIg if infections are a problem.
• HSCT if presenting as SCID; will not cure dwarﬁsm.
• Consider varicella vaccine.

Warts, hypogammaglobulinaemia,
infection, myelokathexis (WHIM)
syndrome
WHIM syndrome is a rare immunodeﬁciency and is the ﬁrst to be associated with deﬁciency of a chemokine receptor (CXCR4). CXCR4 is also
the co-receptor for HIV.

Cause
• Deﬁciency of CXCR4 chemokine receptor for stromal-derived factor 1
(SDF-1):
• SDF-1 is essential for normal myeloid maturation and
differentiation; absence of SDF-1 increases granulocyte apoptosis
and causes myelokathexis (white blood cell retention).
• Autosomal recessive; gene located at 2p21.

Presentation
• Presents early in childhood with recurrent bacterial infections,
developing into bronchiectasis.
• Warts (papillomavirus infection) develop later and are extensive and
conﬂuent; genital warts will predispose to cervical carcinoma.
• Rare patients have cardiac defects.
• Severe granulocytopenia and lymphopenia; bone marrow shows
granulocyte hyperplasia.

Diagnosis
• Clinical and laboratory features.
• Protein and molecular diagnosis not yet routinely available.

Immunology
• Hypogammaglobulinaemia; reduced B-cell numbers, especially memory
B cells.
• Neutrophil function is normal.

59

60

CHAPTER 1

Primary immunodeﬁciency

Treatment
• IVIg for bacterial infections.
• G-CSF may be helpful, even though levels may be raised in some
patients, by increasing neutrophil emigration.

Mendelian susceptibility to
mycobacterial disease (MSMD)
G-Interferon/IL-12 pathway defects
Multiple defects have been identiﬁed in association with inherited susceptibility to mycobacterial infection, especially low-virulence Mycobacteria
(BCG, environmental Mycobacteria), and salmonellosis. Other infections
are rare. Autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, and X-linked inheritances have been reported.
Causes
Deﬁned genetic disorders identiﬁed so far include the following.
• G-Interferon receptor-1 mutations (IFNGR1, 5q23-24), leading to
autosomal recessive loss of expression of the receptor or loss of
G-IFN binding; these map to the extracellular domains. Partial defects
with reduced G-IFN responses have been reported. Dominant defects
have also been reported, involving mutations in the intracellular
domain, leading to surface overexpression of a truncated receptor.
• G-Interferon receptor-2 mutations (IFNGR2, 21q22.1-22.2), causing
either complete or partial deﬁciency of the receptor.
• Autosomal dominant mutations in STAT1 (signal transducer
and activator of transcription 1) that impair the intracellular
signal transduction of G-IFN (two types of mutations, preventing
phosphorylation and DNA binding).
• IL-12 p40 subunit mutations.
• IL-12R B1 deﬁciency due to mutations in the IL-12RB1 gene.
• Interferon regulatory factor 8 (IRF8, 16q24.1): may occur as autosomal
recessive and autosomal dominant forms. Dominant form associated
with selective absence of dendritic cells; recessive form lacks
monocytes and dendritic cells.
• GATA2 deﬁciency (3q21.3): MonoMAC syndrome (monocyte
deﬁciency and mycobacterial disease):
• monocytopenia, NK-cell cytopenia, B-cell lymphopenia.
• immunoglobulins normal or elevated.
• cytogenetic abnormalities in bone marrow (trisomy 8, monosomy 7).
• aplastic anaemia, AML, CML.
• An acquired autoimmune syndrome with autoantibodies against
G-IFN has also been described. May respond to high-dose IVIg,
plasmapheresis, or anti-B-cell therapies such as rituximab).
• Mutations in CYBB gene (coding for gp91phox, normally causing
XL-CGD) have been reported as causing just mycobacterial infection;

TOLL-LIKE RECEPTOR (TLR) DEFECTS

these patients have normal oxidative metabolism by ﬂow cytometry
using dihydrorhodamine.
Diagnosis
• Lack of surface G-IFNR can be identiﬁed by ﬂow cytometry; but lossof-function mutations require genetic identiﬁcation.
• IL-12R defects so far reported lack surface expression, and are
amenable to detection by ﬂow cytometry.
• Other abnormalities require speciﬁc assays backed up by genetic
studies for diagnosis.
Treatment
• G-IFN in high doses in combination with conventional antimycobacterial treatment may be helpful in autosomal dominant
G-IFNR1 and IL-12R defect; infection tends to recur.
• BMT/HSCT has been used in G-IFNR defects, but outcomes have been
poor with GvHD, infections, and generalized granulomatous disease.
• IL-12-related defects appear not to lead to recurrent infections.

Toll-like receptor (TLR) defects
TLRs are part of the innate immune system. Testing for defects in these
pathways is now available via ﬂow cytometry (see Chapter 20).

IRAK-4 deﬁciency
Deﬁciency of IL-1 receptor associated kinase-4 (a Toll-like receptor) has
been reported in association with severe recurrent pyogenic infections,
including Pneumococcus, Staphylococcus, and Shigella, and poor inﬂammatory response (absent inﬂammatory markers). Speciﬁc antibody responses
are poorly maintained after immunization. Interestingly, infections seem
to become less problematic with increasing age. Antibiotic therapy and
immunoglobulin therapy have been used.

MyD88 deﬁciency
An autosomal recessive condition. Features are similar to IRAK-4 deﬁciency,
since the two molecules are associated as part of TLR signalling. All TLRs
except TLR3 signal via MyD88. Infections are mainly Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and can be lifethreatening. There is normal resistance to other bacteria, viruses, and fungi.
As with IRAK-4 deﬁciency, susceptibility to infection declines with age.

UNC93B1 and TLR3 deﬁciency
Deﬁciencies of UNC93B1 or TLR3 lead speciﬁcally to increased susceptibility to HSV-1 encephalitis. UNC93B1 is an endoplasmic reticulum protein involved in the transport of TLR7 and TLR9 to endolysosomes. In the
absence of these receptors, normal anti-viral interferon production does
not occur.

CHAPTER 1

Primary immunodeﬁciency

Phagocytic cell defects
Major defects of phagocytic cells
• Chronic granulomatous disease:
• X-linked
• autosomal recessive.
• Leucocyte adhesion defects (LADs):
• LAD-1: defects of CD18, common B-chain for LFA-1, Mac-1, and
CR4 (CD11a, CD11b, CD11c); defect in CD11c (?);
• LAD-2: defects in synthesis of fucose from GDP-mannose; lack of
expression of Lewis X ligand.
• LAD-3: mutations in Kinlin-3
• Glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deﬁciency.
• Myeloperoxidase deﬁciency.
• Secondary granule deﬁciency.
• Cyclic neutropenia and severe congenital neutropenia.
• Schwachman-Bodian-Diamond syndrome.
• Chediak-Higashi and Griscelli syndromes.
• Familial lymphohistiocytosis and haemophagocytic syndromes.
• NK-cell deﬁciency.
• Rare causes: rac2 deﬁciency.

Chronic granulomatous disease
This is the most signiﬁcant neutrophil defect, although not the most common. It is also the easiest to diagnose.

Cause
• There is a defect of intracellular bacterial killing in neutrophils and
monocytes because of a failure of superoxide, oxygen radical, and
peroxide production.
• X-linked and autosomal recessive forms are described. There is
a deﬁciency of components of cytochrome b558: 91 kDa protein
(X-linked; Xp21.1), 22 kDa protein (16q24), or NADPH oxidase p47
(7q11.23) or p67 (1q25).
• As phagocyte hydrogen peroxidase is normal, catalase-negative
organisms are killed normally whereas catalase-positive organisms
(Staphylococcus aureus, Aspergillus, Nocardia, and Serratia) cause major
problems.
• Kell blood group antigens are encoded adjacent to the X-CGD locus.

Presentation
• Infections with catalase-positive organisms, especially deep-seated
abscesses, osteomyelitis, and chronic granulomata (including orofacial
granuloma).
• May mimic inﬂammatory bowel disease and lead to malabsorption and
obstruction of the bowel.

LEUCOCYTE ADHESION MOLECULE DEFICIENCY (LAD-1, LAD-2, LAD-3)

• Liver abscess is a common ﬁrst presentation, and any child with a liver
abscess has CGD until proved otherwise.
• Usually presents initially in childhood but, rarely, the ﬁrst presentation
may occur in adults.
• Is a cause of atypical hepatic granulomata in the absence of infection.

Immunology and diagnosis
• Neutrophil oxidative metabolism is abnormal (see Part 2).
• The easiest screening test is the nitroblue tetrazolium reduction
(NBT test), but this may miss some cases. The preferred test is a ﬂow
cytometric assay using dihydrorhodamine (some patients may have
abnormal DHR but normal NBT!).
• Bacterial killing will be absent.
• X-linked CGD patients should be tested for deﬁciency of Kell antigens.
• Carriers of XL-CGD are at increased risk of discoid lupus and
photosensitivity.
• Skewed X-inactivation may give rise to females with XL-CGD.

Treatment
• Long-term antibiotics (co-trimoxazole ± itraconazole) are the mainstay
of treatment. Use the liquid formulation of itraconazole (better
absorption) and monitor trough levels, adjusting the dose accordingly.
• In the USA low-dose prophylactic G-IFN tends to be used instead.
• Acute infections should be treated promptly with intravenous
antibiotics, supplemented with high-dose G-IFN.
• Drainage of large abscesses may be required.
• Inﬂammatory bowel disease may be signiﬁcantly helped by high-dose
steroids, particularly where there are obstructive lesions due to
granulomata. This increases infection risk.
• BMT/HSCT is the treatment of choice and should be carried out early
before infective complications become a threat to life. Results from
transplantation in adults are now good.
• Kell-negative XL-CGD patients are a transfusion hazard and need to
be transfused with Kell-negative blood.
• Gene therapy has been used: the long-term outcome is variable even
when there has been initial engraftment of transfected cells.

Outcome
• Outcome has been much improved by the use of prophylactic
antibiotics and G-IFN, but it is still a life-shortening illness (death
usually by 5th decade).

Leucocyte adhesion molecule deﬁciency
(LAD-1, LAD-2, LAD-3)
Cause
• LAD-1 is due to a deﬁciency of the B-chain (CD18) for LFA-1
(CD11a), Mac-1 (CD11b), and CR4 (CD11c).

63

64

CHAPTER 1

Primary immunodeﬁciency

• The gene is located at 21q22.3. There may be variable expression:
the severe phenotype has <1% expression, while in the moderate
(incomplete) phenotype there may be as much as 10% of control
expression.
• LAD-2 is caused by a defect in fucose metabolism, causing the absence
of the sialyl-Lewis X ligand from phagocytes (CD15a). The defect is
due to mutations in the GDP-fucose transporter (FUCT1).
• LAD-3 is caused by mutations in Kinlin3 (required for integrinmediated leucocyte adhesion to endothelium).

Presentation
• Presentation is variable, depending on the phenotype. Infections are
most marked in LAD-1 and LAD-3.
• Delayed umbilical cord separation is a signiﬁcant feature (>10 days).
• Skin infections, intestinal and perianal ulcers, and ﬁstulae are typical.
• Periodontitis occurs in older children and may lead to loss of teeth.
• Immunizations may leave scarred nodules.
• Lack of inﬂammatory change at sites of infection and an absence of pus
formation.
• LAD-2 is accompanied by marked developmental abnormalities.
• LAD-3 causes a bleeding disorder.

Diagnosis and immunology
• Diagnosis depends on the demonstration of reduced/absent molecules
on lymphocytes and granulocytes by ﬂow cytometry.
• PMA stimulation of granulocytes may be necessary to identify the
moderate phenotype in which some upregulation occurs.
• There is usually a peripheral blood neutrophilia, which is often
extreme.
• Neutrophil rolling is impaired in LAD-2, but not in LAD-1 or LAD-3.
Neutrophil adherence is markedly reduced in LAD-1 and LAD-3, but
less so in LAD-2
• In LAD-2 the H blood group antigen is missing from red cells (Bombay
phenotype) and the Lewis blood group antigens are also absent.

Treatment
• Prompt antibiotic therapy is required.
• BMT/HSCT is necessary for the severe phenotype of both LAD-1 and
LAD-3; graft rejection is not possible in the absence of LFA-1. This
observation led to the use of anti-LFA-1 monoclonal antibodies as
anti-rejection therapy. Moderate phenotypes may be more difﬁcult to
transplant.
• LAD-2 has been treated with high-dose oral fucose with beneﬁt,
although not all patients respond.
• One patient developed autoantibodies against re-fucosylated
antigens.

OTHER PHAGOCYTIC CELL DEFECTS

Other phagocytic cell defects
Rac-2 deﬁciency
An autosomal dominant mutation in the rho-GTPase Rac-2 (22q12.13)
has been associated with a presentation similar to that of LAD-1, with
delayed umbilical cord separation, absence of pus, and perirectal ulceration. Chemotaxis was abnormal, and neutrophil granule exocytosis was
impaired. BMT was curative.

G6PD deﬁciency
Cause
• An X-linked (Xq28) condition; the gene is prone to frequent mutations
(200 variants have been recorded).
• Absence of functional G6PD (1-5% of normal activity) impairs the
NADPH system of oxidative metabolism, with effects similar to those
of CGD. However, most variants have 20-50% of normal enzyme
activity and no phagocytic defect.
Presentation and diagnosis
• The presentation is similar to that of CGD, when <5% of enzyme
activity is present.
• Haemolytic anaemia is often present, and can be triggered by certain
foods (fava beans) and drugs (sulphones such as dapsone, primaquine,
salicylates).
• The NBT test is diagnostic and the enzyme activity can be measured.

Myeloperoxidase deﬁciency
This deﬁciency is not uncommon (the gene is located at 17q21.3-q23).
The prevalence is between 1 in 2000 and 1 in 4000 in the USA. Cases
are usually asymptomatic, although occasional defects in killing Candida
have been reported and infection may occur, particularly if the patient is
diabetic.

Glutathione synthetase deﬁciency
Rare autosomal recessive. May be associated with haemolytic anaemia.
Severe deﬁciency is associated with metabolic acidosis, with increased
5-oxoproline levels, progressive neurological disease, and recurrent bacterial
infections due to impaired phagocytosis and intracellular killing. Glutathione
reductase deﬁciency is associated with haemolysis but not with infections.

Schwachman-Bodian-Diamond syndrome
This is an autosomal recessive syndrome of hereditary pancreatic insufﬁciency, accompanied by neutropenia, abnormal neutrophil chemotaxis,
thrombocytopenia, anaemia, and growth retardation. NK-cell lymphopenia is common. The gene is the SBDS gene (7q11)—its precise function is unknown, but it is thought to be involved in RNA metabolism.
Hypogammaglobulinaemia with recurrent sinopulmonary infections may
also occur. Responses to polysaccharide antigens may be absent. Exocrine
pancreatic supplementation is required. Treatment with IVIg may be helpful, and G-CSF has been used, although there is concern over potential risk

65

66

CHAPTER 1

Primary immunodeﬁciency

of myeloid leukaemias. HSCT has also been tried—appears to be increased
risk of GvHD.

Secondary granule deﬁciency
Neutrophil structure is abnormal with bilobed nuclei. Secondary (lactoferrin) granules are absent and there is a deﬁciency of other neutrophil
enzymes (alkaline phosphatase). This leads to defective neutrophil oxidative metabolism and bacterial killing, resulting in skin and sinopulmonary
infections. The diagnosis can be made by careful examination of the blood
ﬁlm, supplemented by cytochemical studies for neutrophil enzymes (NAP
score). Some cases have been associated with defects in the C/EBPe gene
(14q11.2), a CCAAT enhancer protein-binding protein, which acts as a
transcription factor in myelopoiesis.

Cyclic neutropenia
This is a rare syndrome characterized by cyclic reductions in neutrophils,
but it may be more common than previously thought, with milder variants
escaping notice.

Cause
• Autosomal dominant disorder due to mutations in the ELA2 gene,
encoding neutrophil elastase. Mutations affect whether elastase
localizes to granules or to the cell surface membrane. Membrane
expression is associated with disease. Similar mutations in ELA2 also
cause severe congential neutropenia.
• Similar disease in dogs (grey collie syndrome) is due to different gene
defect (see Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome in Disorders of pigmentation
and immune deﬁciency, pp.68-69) and has a 14-day cycle.
• The cycle is usually 21±2-3 days, but the molecular cause of cycling is
unknown.

Presentation
• Mouth ulceration typically occurs at the neutrophil nadir; more
signiﬁcant invasive infection may occur.
• Mood change just before the nadir is often marked. Symptoms may
improve with age.

Diagnosis
• The clue is usually a low neutrophil count during an infective episode.
• Diagnosis is conﬁrmed by serial full blood counts with full differential,
3 times weekly over 4 weeks. Neutrophils may disappear completely.
Symptoms usually occur if the count drops below 1×109/L.
• There is a compensatory monocytosis at the time of the neutrophil nadir.

Management
• G-CSF prevents a dramatic drop but does not abolish the cycle, which
shortens to approximately 14 days.
• However, there is a risk of myeloid leukaemia with chronic G-CSF
therapy and this should be used with circumspection. Data suggest that

OTHER NEUTROPHIL DEFECTS

ELA2 mutations increase the risk of AML and MDS, and this may be
increased further by G-CSF use.
• Prophylactic co-trimoxazole either side of the predicted nadir may be
valuable in preventing infection.

Other neutrophil defects
Barth syndrome
This X-linked disorder, caused by mutations in the TAZ gene, features
cyclic neutropenia, as well as dilated cardiomyopathy and methylglutaconic aciduria. The gene product is an acyltransferase involved in the synthesis of cardiolipin.

Cohen syndrome
This rare autosomal recessive syndrome is due to mutations in the COH1
gene, whose product is involved in vesicle sorting and intracellular protein
transport. Neutropenia is associated with dysmorphic features and mental
retardation.

Severe congenital neutropenia (SCN)
Four different genetic variants of SCN have been reported. The majority
of cases have defects in the ELA2 gene, as in cyclic neutropenia, and are
at risk of developing myelodysplasia (MDS) and acute myeloid leukaemia
(AML). The disorder is autosomal dominant and homozygous defects have
not been reported. However, the neutropenia is static. Mutations in HAX-1
and AK2 (see SCID: reticular dysgenesis (adenylate kinase 2 (AK2) deﬁciency, p.41) also cause severe congenital neutropenia. Rare cases have
been associated with autosomal dominant mutations in the transcriptional
repressor GFI1 gene, causing overexpression of elastase and overﬂow onto
the cell membrane; these patients also have lymphopenia. WASP mutations
have been associated with XLN (see Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS),
X-linked thrombocytopenia (XLT) and X-linked neutropenia (XLN), p.47).
Mutations have also been reported in the gene encoding the receptor for
G-CSF: these patients do not develop MDS or AML. Other possible defects
in the ELA2 promoter region may also contribute to SCN cases.

Kostmann’s syndrome
This is a congenital severe neutropenia due to a neutrophil maturation
defect with arrest at the pro-myelocyte stage. This is genetically distinct
from severe congenital neutropenia and has only been reported in one
family, with an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance. It presents
with recurrent severe infections. Immunoglobulins are raised; there is
a compensatory monocytosis, eosinophilia, and a thrombocytosis. BMT
may be used as treatment. Co-trimoxazole prophylaxis is necessary.

B-Actin deﬁciency
Patients with defective B-actin present with recurrent bacterial infections,
including abscesses, mental retardation, and joint problems. Neutrophil
chemotaxis is abnormal.

67

68

CHAPTER 1

Primary immunodeﬁciency

Disorders of pigmentation and
immune deﬁciency
There have been major advances in the understanding of the genetics of
immune deﬁciencies that are associated with pigmentary disorders.

Chediak-Higashi syndrome
Cause
• An autosomal recessive disease due to mutations in the CHS1 gene
(also known as LYST (lysosomal trafﬁcking regulator)) located at 1q42.1.
• CHS is the human equivalent of the beige mutant mouse.
• The exact function of the LYST protein is not known.
Presentation
• Benign and aggressive presentations occur.
• Characteristic features are partial oculocutaneous albinism (due
to abnormal melanocytes), leading to silver streaks in the hair
(prematurely!) and pigmentary changes in the iris and also the skin.
• Recurrent infections, especially periodontitis and pyogenic infections.
• CNS abnormalities: peripheral and central, with neuropathy, cranial
nerve palsies, parkinsonian features, ﬁts, and mental retardation.
• Hepatosplenomegaly occurs frequently.
Diagnosis
• Giant primary cytoplasmic granules in leucocytes and platelets.
• Hair shafts show diagnostic clumping of pigment granules.
Immunology
• Granulocyte and monocyte chemotaxis is abnormal with delayed
intracellular killing (correctable by ascorbate in vitro).
• Defective NK-cell function is common.
• Neutropenia.
Prognosis
• Outcome is poor in the accelerated phase, with neurological
deterioration and a haemophagocytic syndrome like familial
lymphohistiocytosis (see p.70).
• Expression of CTLA-4 has been associated with development of the
accelerated phase.
• This should be treated with etoposide followed by BMT/HSCT.

Partial albinism (Griscelli syndrome)
This is similar to Chediak-Higashi syndrome but is distinguished from it by
the absence of giant granules.
• Three types have now been identiﬁed, and mouse models exist for
all types. The genes identiﬁed are all involved in the intracellular
movement of melanosomes, mechanisms that are also used in granulecontaining cells to undertake exocytosis.

DISORDERS OF PIGMENTATION AND IMMUNE DEFICIENCY

• GS type 1 due to mutations in the MYO5A gene (15q21.1) encoding
myosin Va. This type presents with albinism and severe neurological
disease with mental retardation and developmental delay.
• GS type 2 due to mutations in RAB27A gene (15q21.1), encoding a
GTPase Rab27a involved in the secretory pathway. Patients have
hypopigmentation and a severe immune defect, culminating in an
accelerated phase of fulminant haemophagocytosis. Treatment is
with BMT/HSCT.
• GS type 3 due to mutations in the MLPH gene, coding for
melanophilin, and leading to impaired interaction with Rab27a. This
type has the best prognosis.
• Diagnosis can be conﬁrmed by microscopy of hairs to examine
pigment deposition.
• Delayed hypersensitivity and NK-cell function are defective; reduced
immunoglobulins and neutrophil problems have also been described.

Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome type 2
Type 2 HPS is an autosomal recessive disorder associated with mutations
in the AP3B1 gene. The clinical features are severe congenital (non-cycling)
neutropenia and defects of platelet-dense bodies, with a bleeding tendency and oculocutaneous albinism. The equivalent gene defect in dogs
causes the grey collie syndrome; the mouse mutant is pearl. Other forms
of HPS are recognized with distinct gene defects but these do not have
neutropenia and infections.

p14 deﬁciency
A single family has been described with deﬁciency of the endosomal adaptor protein p14 (MAPBPIP). Features include severe congenital neutropenia, short stature, hypopigmentation, coarse features, and recurrent
bacterial chest infections. T- and B-cell abnormalities were also noted.

Other pigmentary disorders
Other genetic disorders of pigmentation not associated with immune deﬁciency include:
• piebaldism due to mutations in the KIT gene.
• Waardenburg syndrome characterized by piebaldism with
sensorineural deafness caused by multiple gene defects (PAX3, MITF,
SLUG, EDN3, EDNRB, SOX10).
• Oculocutaneous albinism (four genes: TYR, P, TYRP, MATP).
• Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome, types 1 and 3-6 (HSP1,3-6).
Other genes causing defects of pigmentation have been identiﬁed in the
mouse, but human equivalents have yet to be identiﬁed.

CHAPTER 1

Primary immunodeﬁciency

Familial lymphohistiocytosis,
haemophagocytic syndrome in other
conditions, and NK-cell deﬁciency
Familial lymphohistiocytosis (FLH)

• FLH is an autosomal recessive disease of childhood, presenting with
inﬁltrations of polyclonal CD8+ T cells and macrophages into many
organs following viral infections.
• Genetics is complicated. Five defects have been identiﬁed:
• FLH1—no gene identiﬁed
• FLH2—Perforin deﬁciency (PRF1)
• FLH3—Munc 13-4 (UNC13D, 17q25.1)
• FLH4—Syntaxin 11 (STX11, mainly Kurdish patients)
• FLH5—Munc 18.2 (STXBP2)
• In addition, XIAP deﬁciency is sometimes also classiﬁed as one of
the FLH conditions (see X-linked lymphoproliferative disease type
2, XIAP deﬁciency (XLP-2), p.25).
• Polymorphisms in CTLA-4 in Japanese with infection-triggered HLH
• Majority of Turkish patients are FLH-2, FLH-3, or FLH-4.
• Presentation is with fever, hepatosplenomegaly, liver dysfunction,
neurological disease, rash, and lymphadenopathy.
• Inﬂammatory bowel disease may be a feature.
• NK-cell and cytotoxic T-cell function is markedly reduced.
• sCD25 increased (highest levels associated with poorer prognosis).
• Ferritin levels markedly increased.
• Speciﬁc ﬂow cytometric tests are available for some variants (see
Chapter 20).
• Perforin deﬁciency is the main cause of rapidly fatal FLH.
• Failure of apoptosis has been suggested as a mechanism for the
excessive cellular inﬁltrates.
• Treatment is with etoposide-containing regimes and HSCT (ideally not
when there is ﬂorid HLH as this markedly reduces survival).

Haemophagocytic syndrome in other conditions
Haemophagocytosis has been reported to occur as part of the accelerated
phase of type 2 Griscelli syndrome patients, Chediak-Higashi syndrome,
and X-linked lymphoproliferative syndrome triggered by EBV exposure. It
is also seen in SLE, adult-onset Still’s disease, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis,
and Castleman’s disease. It has been suggested that IL-18 may be responsible in the autoimmune secondary cases. Macrophage activation syndrome
is seen juvenile rheumatoid arthritis and SLE—it is similar to HLH.

NK-cell deﬁciency
• Primary NK-cell deﬁciency has been reported, causing severe or fatal
infections with herpesviruses and varicella. It usually presents in the
teens or early adulthood.
• Both sexes are affected.
• Differential diagnosis includes XLPS.

IMMUNODEFICIENCY WITH GENERALIZED GROWTH RETARDATION

• Homozygosity for a polymorphism in the FcRGIIIa receptor (CD16)
on NK cells has been associated with increased susceptibility to
herpesviruses; this change also interferes with the ability of certain
anti-CD16 monoclonal antibodies to bind.
• One family showed linkage to a region of chromosome 8.

Immunodeﬁciency in association with
other rare syndromes
Immunodeﬁciency has been described as a feature in a wide variety of
other genetic syndromes. This is not an exhaustive list!

Other genetic syndromes
Seckel syndrome
An autosomal recessive syndrome characterized by ‘bird-headed’ dwarﬁsm,
mental retardation, hypoplastic anaemia, and hypogammaglobulinaemia.
Down syndrome
This is due to trisomy 21. There is a progressive decrease in IgM, dysplastic
thymus, low NK activity, and an unusual sensitivity to G-interferon, whose
receptor is located on chromosome 21. There is an increase in Tcr γδ
cells at the expense of Tcr αβ cells. T-cell proliferation to mitogens is
reduced, with poor IL-2 production. There is an increase in infections and
also in malignancy and autoimmune disease.
Turner syndrome
The genetic abnormality is XO; 50% of patients have low IgG and IgM.
Chromosome 18 syndromes
Ring chromosome 18 and deletions of the long and short arms of chromosome 18 are associated with facial hypoplasia, mental retardation, and
low/absent IgA.

Immunodeﬁciency with generalized
growth retardation
Schimke immuno-osseus dysplasia
An autosomal recessive syndrome characterized by nephropathy, skeletal
dysplasia, and lentigenes. There is a lymphopenia of CD4+ T cells with poor
T-cell mitogen responses. Pancytopenia is common. Immunoglobulin levels
may be reduced. The gene is SMARCAL1, encoding a chromatin remodelling
protein. This gene affects thymic function. Patients are prone to bacterial,
fungal, and viral infections. HSCT has been reported to be helpful.

Immunodeﬁciency with absent thumbs (TAR syndrome)
There is radial dysplasia, ichthyosis, and anosmia. Recurrent infections and
chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis occur. There are poor T-cell mitogen
responses and absent IgA, with low IgG and IgM.

CHAPTER 1

Primary immunodeﬁciency

Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome
Caused by deletions on chromosome 4p, leading to a syndrome of growth
retardation, mental retardation, microcephaly, and multiple other abnormalities affecting skeleton, teeth, heart, ears, and eyes. Recurrent bacterial
infections are a feature. Humoral immune defects are variable, ranging
from pan-hypogammaglobulinaemia to IgA, IgG2, or speciﬁc antibody deﬁciency. Candidiate gene is WHSC1, a histone methyltransferase.

Others
• Dubowitz syndrome (autosomal recessive; dwarﬁsm, eczema, bone
marrow failure).
• Growth retardation, facial anomalies, and immunodeﬁciency.
• Progeria (Hutchison-Gilford syndrome): premature ageing.
These syndromes have all been reported with variable immunodeﬁciencies.

Skin disease and immunodeﬁciency
Dyskeratosis congenita
Dyskeratosis congenita is characterized by cutaneous pigmentation, nail
dystrophy, and oral leucoplakia, and is complicated by malignancy and
bone marrow failure. Autosomal dominant or recessive and X-linked
forms occur. The X-linked form is associated with mutations in the DKC1
gene encoding dyskerin, a nucleolar protein. Variable immune defects
are found: hypogammaglobulinaemia and poor delayed-type hypersensitivity. Thymic aplasia may occur. The same gene defect also causes the
Høyeraal-Hreidarsson syndrome (microcephaly, growth failure, and pancytopenia, which may mimic SCID).

Netherton syndrome
Characterized by trichorrhexis, ichthyosis, and atopy; some patients have
low IgG, abnormal neutrophil function, and poor T-cell mitogen responses.
Mutations in the gene SPINK5, encoding a serine protease inhibitor, have
been identiﬁed in some patients.

Acrodermatitis enteropathica
This is caused by zinc deﬁciency, leading to eczema, diarrhoea, malabsorption, and sinopulmonary infections. T-cell numbers and function are
reduced, and immunoglobulins are low. All the defects can be corrected
with supplemental zinc.

Anhidrotic ectodermal dysplasia
This family of diseases is associated with defective NFκB signalling.
Autosomal recessive or X-linked forms of this syndrome occur. Defects
in the NEMO gene have been reported in the X-linked form, associated
with signiﬁcant immunodeﬁciency (see ‘Autosomal hyper-IgM syndromes’,
p.22). Autosomal dominant and recessive forms have mutations in the
EDA1 gene encoding ectodysplasin (a TNF cyokine family member) or
its receptor EDAR, a member of the TNF-receptor superfamily, encoded

IMMUNODEFICIENCY WITH METABOLIC ABNORMALITIES

by EDA3. EDAR mutations have been associated with autosomal recessive disease. Hypohidrosis and faulty dentition are the key features. Upper
respiratory infections occur. There is variable T- and B-cell function, and
speciﬁc antibody responses may be poor.

Papillon-Lefèvre syndrome
Abnormal neutrophil chemotaxis and reduced neutrophil killing have been
reported in this syndrome of hyperkeratosis and pyoderma with periodontitis. The gene defect has been identiﬁed as mutations in cathepsin
C (also known as dipeptidyl peptidase I), an enzyme involved in protein
degradation.

Epidermodysplasia verruciformis (Lewandowsky-Lutz
dysplasia)
Rare autosmosomal recessive skin disorder with high susceptibility to papillomavirus infection (typically HPV types 5 and 8). Caused by inactivating
mutations in the EVER1 and EVER2 genes on chromosome 17, which control access to zinc. Presents with ﬂat wart-like papules and there is a high
risk of developing skin cancer. Treatment with retinoids, interferons, and
high-dose cimetidine has been suggested.
Extensive warts have also been associated with common variable
immune deﬁciency, interferon-γ deﬁciency, and WHIM syndrome.

Immunodeﬁciency with metabolic
abnormalities
ADA and PNP deﬁciencies are metabolic abnormalities causing immunodeﬁciency, but are covered in ‘SCID: ZAP-70 kinase deﬁciency and ADA
deﬁciency’ and ‘SCID: purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) deﬁciency’,
pp.37-39).

Transcobalamin II deﬁciency
Autosomal recessive deﬁciency of TC II (22q11.2), a vitamin-B12-binding
protein essential for transport of B12, has been reported in association
with diarrhoea, failure to thrive, megaloblastic anaemia, lymphopenia,
neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia. Abnormal neutrophil function and
hypogammaglobulinaemia are present. All the features are reversible with
B12 therapy.

Methylmalonic acidaemia
The features are similar to those of TC II deﬁciency. It is treated with
folic acid.

Type I hereditary orotic aciduria
This is an autosomal recessive disease of retarded growth, diarrhoea,
and megaloblastic anaemia. Fatal meningitis and disseminated varicella
may be complications. There is a T-cell lymphopenia and impaired T-cell
function.

73

74

CHAPTER 1

Primary immunodeﬁciency

Biotin-dependent carboxylase deﬁciency
An autosomal recessive condition characterized by convulsions, ataxia,
alopecia, candidiasis, and intermittent lactic acidosis. The severe neonatal
form presents with severe acidosis and recurrent sepsis. There is increased
urinary B-hydroxypropionic acid, methyl citrate, B-methylcrotonglycine,
and 3-hydroxyisovalerate excretion. Decreased T and B cells with low IgA
are noted. It is treated with biotin.

Mannosidosis
This is a lysosomal storage disease that is associated with abnormal neutrophil (chemotaxis, phagocytosis, and killing) and lymphocyte (hypogammaglobulinaemia and poor PHA responses) function.

Glycogen storage disease type Ib
Recurrent infections, including severe oral ulceration and abscesses, are
associated with neutropenia and neutrophil dysfunction in this syndrome.

Hypercatabolism of immunoglobulin
Familial hypercatabolism
Familial hypercatabolism of IgG has been associated with bone abnormalities, abnormal glucose metabolism, and recurrent infections. IgG is very
low with a very short half-life; serum albumin may be normal or low.

Intestinal lymphangiectasia (Waldmann’s disease)
This is due to a failure of normal lymphatic development in the bowel, with
abnormally dilated lymphatics. Similar abnormalities may occur elsewhere,
causing localized oedema, effusions, and ascites. There is enteric loss of
lymphocytes and malabsorption, particularly of fats. There is a profound
lymphopenia, with hypoalbuminaemia and hypogammaglobulinaemia; IgM
may be in the normal range and infections may be less severe than the
IgG level might predict. Speciﬁc responses may be normal but very shortlived. IVIg can be given, but weekly therapy may be required to maintain
adequate levels. Fat malabsorption may be severe and medium-chain triglyceride supplements may be required.

Splenic disorders
Congenital asplenia and Ivemark syndrome
Asplenia may occur alone or in association with partial situs inversus and
cardiac defects. Early infections, especially with capsulated organisms, are
a typical feature. Sudden unheralded death from overwhelming sepsis
may occur, and the diagnosis may only be made at post-mortem. Survival
into adult life is possible without serious infection. Blood ﬁlm will show
Howell-Jolly bodies; ultrasound will demonstrate absence of the spleen,
which can be conﬁrmed by absence of uptake on a labelled white cell
scan or on a red cell clearance scan. Initial poor polysaccharide responses
may improve after the ﬁrst 3 years of life. However, there remains a

COMPLEMENT DEFICIENCIES

risk of overwhelming sepsis and lifelong prophylactic antibiotics should
be administered, together with regular immunizations against inﬂuenza,
pneumococci, Haemophilus inﬂuenzae type b (Hib), and meningococci.
Management is as for acquired asplenia (for further details on management see Asplenia, p.112).

Tuftsin deﬁciency
Tuftsin is a tetrapeptide released from the CH2 domain of IgG by the
actions of a membrane leucokinase and a splenic endocarbocypeptidase.
It stimulates the bactericidal function of phagocytic cells. Primary tuftsin
deﬁciency has been described in ﬁve patients, in association with increased
infections. Administration of immunoglobulin replacement may be beneﬁcial. Secondary tuftsin deﬁciency occurs in splenectomy, asplenia, and
hyposplenia (coeliac disease). Tuftsin production may also be impaired by
parenteral nutrition, probably by lipids.

Complement deﬁciencies
Cause
• Genetic deﬁciencies of all complement components have been described,
including the regulatory inhibitors, C1 inhibitor, factor I, and factor H.
• Properdin deﬁciency is X-linked; the others are autosomal recessives,
except C1-inhibitor deﬁciency which is autosomal dominant.
• Factors B, C2, and C4 form part of the extended MHC complex (short
arm of chromosome 6, located between HLA-D and HLA-B loci).
• Complement deﬁciencies are common in South Africa and in the
countries of the North African coast and Eastern Mediterranean. C2
and C4 deﬁciencies are relatively common. An increasing number of
C4 null alleles substantially increases the risk of developing lupus.

Presentation
• Increased susceptibility to pyogenic infections in C3, factor I, and factor
H deﬁciencies.
• Increased susceptibility to neisserial infections in C5, C6, C7, C8a, C8b,
C9, factor D, and properdin deﬁciencies.
• Recurrent neisserial infection, especially meningitis, should always
prompt a screen for complement deﬁciency; the disease may be milder
than in complement-replete individuals.
• C9 deﬁciency is common in Japan and may be asymptomatic, as slow
lysis through C5-C8 may take place without C9.
• Increased susceptibility to SLE-like syndrome in C1q, C1r/C1s, C4, C2,
C5, C6, C7, C8a, and C8b. C2-deﬁcient lupus is often atypical, with
marked cutaneous features.
• Factor H, factor I, and MCP deﬁciencies are associated with the nondiarrhoea-associated haemolytic-uraemic syndrome.

Diagnosis
• Diagnosis is by screening for the classic, alternate, and terminal lytic
sequences by functional complement assays (classic and alternate

75

76

CHAPTER 1

Primary immunodeﬁciency

pathway CH100—see CH100/APCH100 (haemolytic complement; lytic
complement function tests), p.448), followed by measurement of
individual components, as indicated by the screening tests.

Treatment
• No speciﬁc treatment is available; use of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) may
make the acute problems worse.
• Recurrent neisserial infection may be prevented by prophylactic
antibiotics and meningococcal vaccination may help, although there
are concerns that the disease may be more severe if it occurs in a
complement-deﬁcient person after vaccination.
• Prophylactic penicillin (phenoxymethylpenicillin (penicillin V) 500mg
bd adult dose; erythromycin 250mg bd if allergic to penicillin) is highly
desirable.
• Autoimmune disease is treated in the normal way.

Ficolin-3 deﬁciency
• Ficolin-3 is a recognition molecule in the lectin pathway, encoded by
the FCN3 gene.
• An adult patient has been described with homozygous deﬁciency of
ﬁcolin-3, who presented with recurrent respiratory tract infections,
including Haemophilus and Pseudomonas, and extensive bronchiectasis.
• No speciﬁc treatment has been identiﬁed.

Mannan-binding lectin (MBL) deﬁciency
MBL (10q11.2) is involved in the initiation of complement activation via the
lectin pathway, triggered by binding to mannose residues on bacterial cell
surfaces. Although deﬁciency of MBL has been associated with infections,
many mutations (the gene is highly polymorphic) reducing MBL levels have
been identiﬁed in asymptomatic families, indicating that MBL deﬁciency
alone is insufﬁcient to cause disease in the absence of other host-defence
problems.
• It has been estimated that up to 5% of the population lack functional
MBL and this has led to suggestions that MBL deﬁciency may have a
beneﬁcial effect in later life.
• MBL deﬁciency in cystic ﬁbrosis has been associated with a worse
prognosis.
• The risk of infection in children with low MBL seems to be highest in
the ﬁrst 2 years of life, when speciﬁc polysaccharide responses are
poor. Therefore MBL’s value may be early protection before speciﬁc
antibody production is optimum, with its role diminishing in later life
when it is replaced by antibody.
• MBL deﬁciency may be a risk factor for infections during
chemotherapy, and after stem cell transplantation.
• Infections are usually due to encapsulated organisms.
• Opsonic failure is described.
• Reports associate low MBL with autoimmune diseases.
• Deﬁciency of MASP2 has been reported in association with pyogenic
infections.

HEREDITARY ANGIOEDEMA AND C4-BINDING PROTEIN DEFICIENCY

Hereditary angioedema and C4-binding
protein deﬁciency
Hereditary angioedema (HAE)
Cause
• Two main types of HAE are recognized: type I (85%; gene deletion,
no protein produced) and type II (15%; point mutation in active site of
enzyme). The gene is located on chromosome 11.
• The condition is autosomal dominant as one normal gene is insufﬁcient
to protect against symptoms.
• Type III HAE has been associated with a gain in function mutation in
factor XII.
• There is failure of inactivation of the complement and kinin systems,
but the angioedema is most likely to be due to the latter (bradykinin)
rather than the former.
Presentation
• There is an angioedema (deep tissue swelling) of any part of the body,
including airway and gut; the latter presents with recurrent abdominal
pain and repeated laparotomies may be undertaken before the
diagnosis is made.
• There is no urticaria or itch, although patients often describe an
uncomfortable prodromal tingling.
• Attacks begin in later childhood/teenage years and may be precipitated
by trauma (beware dental work and operations) and infections.
• Frequency of attacks may be increased by oral contraceptives and
pregnancy. There is an increased risk of immune complex disease.
• Type III HAE occurs mainly in women, especially if oral contraceptives
are used.
• Attacks in all types of HAE can be triggered by trauma, infections, and
emotional stress.
Diagnosis
• Typically C4 and C2 are undetectable during an acute attack and are
low/absent between attacks.
• In type I, there will be a low C1-inhibitor level immunochemically and
this will become undetectable in an acute attack.
• In type II, a normal or high level of inhibitor will be measured
immunochemically, but function will be low or absent.
• Angioedema may be acquired secondary to SLE or lymphoma, and
these may be distinguished from HAE by the reduction in C1q,
although this is not always reliable (see Chapter 2).
Treatment
• Treat major attacks with puriﬁed or recombinant inhibitor: Berinert®
or Cinryze® (1000-1500 IU, i.e. 2-3 ampoules) by slow intravenous
injection. Guidelines suggest 20 IU/kg, but not all patients require this
dose.

77

78

CHAPTER 1

Primary immunodeﬁciency

• Recombinant C1 inhibitor (Rhucin®) is effective, but because it
is derived from rabbit milk, it has a short half-life (2 hours). It is
contraindicated in patients with rabbit allergy.
• Subcutaneous treatment with 3mL icatibant (Firazyr®), a bradykinin B2
receptor antagonist), repeated after 8 hours if necessary, is as effective,
and may be given by self-administration at home. The main side effect
is injection site pain.
• Ecallantide (Kalbitor®), a plasma kallikrein inhibitor, is licensed for
subcutaneous use in USA but not Europe. It is effective but 2.7% of
patients developed anaphylaxis!
• FFP may be an emergency alternative, but there are the usual risks
of transmitted infection and it is also possible for FFP to exacerbate
attacks by providing more substrate.
• Tracheostomy may be required if there is signiﬁcant laryngeal oedema.
• Prophylaxis may be obtained with modiﬁed androgens (danazol 200-
600mg/day, or stanozolol 2.5-10mg/day) or anti-ﬁbrinolytics (tranexamic
acid 2-4g/day). Regular liver function tests and liver ultrasound scans are
required for monitoring therapy with all these agents.
• Prophylactic puriﬁed inhibitor should be used before high-risk surgical
procedures, although tranexamic acid may be adequate for minor
procedures.
• Dental work should always be carried out in hospital in view of the
risk of developing oral oedema and airway obstruction.
• Abdominal attacks respond poorly to puriﬁed inhibitor. Treatment
should be conservative: analgesia (NSAIDs), IV ﬂuids, and avoidance
of unnecessary laparotomies (unless there is good evidence for other
pathology).
• Type III HAE is said to respond to standard HAE therapies.

C4-binding protein (C4bp) deﬁciency
C4bp inhibits the classical pathway of complement activation by blocking
the formation of the C3 convertase C4bC2a. Deﬁciency of C4bp may
cause angioedema and, because of its interaction with protein S, may also
be a cause of purpura fulminans.

Angioetensin-converting enzyme (ACE) deﬁciency
Deﬁciency of ACE, with undetectable serum levels is associated with
recurrent angioedema. Manage as for HAE.

Acquired angioedema (AAE)
Acquired C1 inhibitor deﬁciency occurs in association with lymphoproliferative disorders and more rarely in association with SLE. The most common disorder is splenic villous lymphoma, presenting predominantly in an
older population. Splenomegaly is usual. It is also associated with MGUS,
Hodgkin’s lymphoma, and adenocarcinoma. There may be autoantibodies
to C1-inh; the pattern of complement consumption is said to be different
(see Complement deﬁciencies, p.75). Attacks are triggered by similar stimuli to HAE. Gastrointestinal attacks are less common than HAE. Manage as
for HAE; treat underlying cause.

CHAPTER 2

Secondary immunodeﬁciency

Introduction
Many disease states have been associated with immune dysfunction of varying degrees of severity and signiﬁcance; some rare secondary disorders
have already been covered in Chapter 1. In this and subsequent chapters
the immunological abnormalities will be discussed, together with the value
of immunological tests (if any). However, there will not be a detailed discussion of the clinical and non-immunological features of the diseases, and
the reader is advised to consult other standard textbooks.

Classiﬁcation of secondary
immunodeﬁciency
• Viral infections:
• HIV, CMV, EBV, rubella, ?enteroviruses (echoviruses,
Coxsackieviruses), measles, inﬂuenza.

asplenia).
• Cardiac surgery (thymectomy).
• Other host-defence disorders:
• cilial dyskinesia
• cystic ﬁbrosis
• yellow nail syndrome
• Young syndrome
• Alpha-1-anti-trypsin deﬁciency.
• Burns.
• Myotonic dystrophy.

Human immunodeﬁciency virus 1 and 2
HIV-1 and HIV-2 are retroviruses, responsible for the acquired immunodeﬁciency syndrome (AIDS). For more detailed information on clinical
aspects see Oxford Handbook of Genitourinary Medicine 2e.

Immunological features
• Virus enters the cells via a cognate interaction of the gp120 env with
CD4 and a chemokine receptor, either CxCR4 or CCR5.
• It also infects other CD4+ cells (macrophages, dendritic cells) and
other cells expressing CD4-like surface proteins (neuronal cells).
• Macrophage tropic viruses use CCR5, and infect T cells poorly; T-cell
tropic viruses use CXCR4 for entry and form syncytia.
• Resistance to viral infection is associated with polymorphism in the
chemokine receptors.
• A viral isolate entering T cells via CD8 has been described.
• Uptake of virus into phagocytic cells may be augmented by antibody,
and complement. HIV activates complement.
• High levels of viral replication may take place in lymph nodes.
• Initial viraemia after infection is controlled by CD8+ cytotoxic T cells
(increased cell numbers). The asymptomatic phase is characterized
by strong cytotoxic responses, but viral replication still detectable
intermittently, i.e. HIV is not a true latent virus.
• The antibody response to major viral proteins appears after a lag
phase of up to 3 months and persists through the asymptomatic phase
but declines in late-stage disease.
• Marked B-cell dysfunction with polyclonal increase in immunoglobulins
and the appearance of multiple autoantibodies.
• In the seroconversion illness there is a dramatic fall in CD4+ T cells
and rise of CD8+ T cells. The levels of CD4+ T cells may drop to a
level at which opportunistic infections may occur at this early stage
(poor prognostic indicator). Levels then usually recover to within
the low normal range. There is then a slow decline of absolute CD4+
T-cell count over time (years) following infection.

83

84

CHAPTER 2

Secondary immunodeﬁciency

• Passage to the symptomatic phase is characterized by a rapid drop
in CD4+ T cells, loss of cytotoxic activity, and switch of virus type
from slow-growing, non-syncytial-forming strains to rapidly growing,
syncytial-forming strains (quasi-species evolving through lack of
replicative ﬁdelity and under immunological selection pressure). This is
accompanied by the occurrence of opportunistic infections.
• Activation of T cells enhances viral replication and hence CD4+ T-cell
destruction. Therefore opportunistic infections enhance the selfdestruction of the immune system. Long-term non-progressors and
• patients responding to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART)
show good proliferative responses to gag proteins. Progression has
been associated with a switch from Th1 to Th2 responses.
• HIV preferentially infects CD45RO+ cells but the depletion of T cells
principally affects CD45RA+CD62L+ naive T cells.
• T-cell depletion is caused by increased apoptosis, impaired production
(HIV effects on thymus), and destruction of both infected and
uninfected cells.
• HIV replication is suppressed by natural CCR5 chemokine ligands,
RANTES, MIP-1A, and MIP-1B, which are secreted by CD8+ T cells.
SDF-1A is the natural ligand for CXCR4. High levels of chemokine
production have been associated with resistance to infection.

Diagnosis and monitoring
• Diagnosis depends on the detection of antiviral antibody ± viral
antigen, not on immunological markers. Screening tests for anti-HIV
antibody are followed up by PCR-based tests. Informed consent must
be obtained.
• The most accurate monitoring of disease is now available through
measurements of viral load by quantitative PCR (viral load).
0 Lymphocyte surface markers (CD4 count) must not be used as a way
of HIV testing without consent.
• CD4+ T cell numbers will be reduced and CD8+ T cells increased
in most acute viral infections and in seriously ill patients in the ITU
setting.
• In the acute seroconversion illness, there is a sharp fall in absolute
CD4+ T-cell numbers and an increase in CD8+ T-cell numbers with
T-cell activation markers increased (IL-2 receptor (CD25) and MHC
class II (DR)); this normally returns rapidly to normal as evidence
of viral replication disappears. Persistent CD4+ T-cell lymphopenia
after seroconversion illness is a poor prognostic sign indicating rapid
progression to terminal illness.
• Sequential monitoring of the CD4+ T-cell numbers provides guidance
on the rate of progression of disease and identiﬁes levels at which
therapeutic interventions may be indicated (e.g. Pneumocystis
prophylaxis at 0.2×109/L CD4+ T cells).
• Once the CD4+ T-cell count falls below 0.05×109/L, further monitoring
is of little clinical value (except psychologically to patients, who view
cessation of monitoring as doctors giving up).

HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS 1 AND 2

• Successful treatment with HAART will lead to a rise of CD4+ T cells
to within the normal range and suppression of viral load.
• Immune function will recover in patients with a good response to
HAART:
• recovery is biphasic
• rapid increase in CD4+ T cells in ﬁrst 3-6 months, mainly CD45RO+
memory T cells (decreased apoptosis and redistribution?)
• second phase is due to slower increase in CD54RA+CD62L+ naive
T cells owing to increased thymic emigration
• rapid increase in CD8+ T cells initially followed by decline
• return of cutaneous reactivity to recall antigens.
• Serum immunoglobulins are usually polyclonally elevated (IgG levels
>50g/L may be recorded); serial measurements have no clinical utility.
Most of the antibody is either ‘junk’ or relates to an anamnestic
response.
• Autoantibodies may be detected (including antinuclear and dsDNA
antibodies, anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA), and
anti-cardiolipin). The presence of autoantibodies may cause serious
diagnostic confusion, especially if the clinical presentation is atypical.
• Rare patients, usually children, may suffer from panhypogammaglobulinaemia or speciﬁc antibody deﬁciency, presenting with
recurrent bacterial infections; these patients may derive signiﬁcant
beneﬁt from IVIg. It has been more difﬁcult to demonstrate speciﬁc
antibody defects in adults, although a subpopulation of adult patients
do have recurrent sinopulmonary infections with Haemophilus and
Pneumococcus: IVIg seems to be less helpful.
• Serum B2-microglobulin levels may be elevated, as a marker of
increased lymphocyte turnover; however, the range of elevation in
HIV+ patients is small compared with that seen in lymphoproliferative
disease, and its value (except where CD4+ T-cell counts are
unavailable) is small. Serum and urinary neopterin, a marker of
macrophage activation, may also be elevated. There is little to choose
between these two surrogate markers and viral load is much more
clinically relevant.

Immunotherapy
• The mainstay of therapy at present is the use of antiretroviral
agents. Mono- or dual-agent therapy is not recommended. Complex
multi-agent regimes are now used. The reader is advised to consult
the current HIV literature for information on the current state
of therapeutic options. Some regimes require strict timing of
administration and high levels of compliance. Multiresistant HIV strains
have been reported.
• IVIg may be helpful in certain HIV+ infants, although not in adults.
• Other immunotherapies (interferons, IL-2) have been uniformly
disappointing and are not used routinely. A-IFN enjoyed a vogue in
the treatment of Kaposi’s sarcoma (due to HHV-8), but the latter
responds better to cytotoxic therapy and radiation.
• Use of passive immunotherapy has been disappointing.

CHAPTER 2

Secondary immunodeﬁciency

• No reliable vaccine is yet available, although trials are continuing on a
number of candidate vaccines.

Immune reconstitution inﬂammatory syndrome (IRIS)
• Occurs in HIV+ patients with very low CD4+ T-cell counts, especially
if on protease inhibitors.
• Good virological and immunological response to HAART.
• Temporal association with the introduction of HAART, although may
be delayed.
• Associated with the presence of infection (either recognized or
cryptic):
• TB, Cryptococcus, CMV, JC virus, Pneumocystis jiroveci, VZV, hepatitis
B and C, Kaposi’s sarcoma
• Features include:
• infection-speciﬁc features (depending on organ infected)
• fever
• lymphadenopathy
• likely to be due to excessive cytokine release as improved
lymphocyte numbers interact with infection
• protease inhibitors increase macrophage IL-6 and TNF-α
production.
• Management is aggressive treatment of underlying infection.

Castleman’s syndrome
• Occurs in association with HIV, especially with HHV8 co-infection.
• Characterized by polyclonal lymphproliferation causing
lymphadenopathy, fever, weight loss, leucopenia.
• Histology of lymph nodes shows typical ‘onion-skin’ change.
• Also seen in SLE, POEMS syndrome, and paraneoplastic pemphigus.
• Caused by excessive IL-6 production.
• May respond to antiviral drugs (HHV-8, HIV), rituximab, or possibly
anti-IL6 monoclonal antibodies.

Epstein-Barr virus
EBV is associated with infectious mononucleosis (glandular fever), Hodgkin’s
disease, Burkitt’s lymphoma, and nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Rare EBVpositive T-cell lymphomas have also been described (T/NK—lethal midline
granuloma).

Immunological features
• EBV is a transforming B-lymphotropic virus of the herpes family,
binding to the cells via CD21 (C3d) receptor and MHC class II
antigens. This receptor is also expressed on follicular dendritic
cells and pharyngeal and cervical epithelium. All these tissues are
targets. Pharyngeal epithelium is usually affected ﬁrst, with
infection spreading to B cells in the adjacent lymphoid tissue of
Waldeyer’s ring.

EPSTEIN-BARR VIRUS

• Following infection there is a B lymphoproliferation, triggered by
cross-linking of the CD21, CD19, CD81 complex by the virus, which
is controlled rapidly by cytotoxic T cells which form the ‘atypical
mononuclear cells’ seen on smears. Both MHC-restricted and
unrestricted cells are produced, with the latter directly recognizing a
virally induced antigen on the cells (LYDMA (lymphocyte-determined
membrane antigen)). The viral BZLF1 protein is a major target antigen.
• Viral persistence occurs, with reactivation of infection in the
immunocompromised (immunosuppressed patients, transplant
recipients, HIV-infected patients), giving oral hairy leucoplakia,
lymphocytic interstitial pneumonitis and lymphoma. Nasopharyngeal
carcinoma also occurs, although other cofactors are likely to be
involved.
• In patients with a genetic predisposition (Duncan’s syndrome (XLPS),
NK-cell deﬁciency (see Chapter 1)), severe or fatal infection can occur
on ﬁrst exposure to EBV.
• Although infectious mononucleosis (glandular fever) is usually a
self-limiting illness, some patients fail to clear the virus and develop
an appropriate sequence of IgG antibodies. These patients have
persistently positive IgM antibodies to EBV and have chronic symptoms
(fatigue, malaise, sore throats).
• In the acute phase of EBV infection there is suppression of mitogen
and allogeneic responses. NK function is also abnormal even though
cell numbers are increased. It has been shown that EBV-transformed
cells secrete a homologue of IL-10. Monocyte chemotaxis is also
abnormal.
• EBV infection may cause severe B-cell lymphoproliferative disease in
immunosuppressed patients and in patients after BMT. It also causes
B-cell lymphomas, especially in solid organ transplant recipients on
long-term immunosuppression.

Immunological diagnosis
• Usual screening test (Monospot) for acute EBV infection relies on
the production of heterophile antibodies that agglutinate sheep cells.
This test may miss cases. IgM antibodies are detected and are then
succeeded rapidly by IgG antibodies to early antigen (EA) and viral
capsid antigen (VCA); antibodies to EBV nuclear antigen (EBNA)
appear weeks to months after infection.
• Initial lymphopenia is followed by lymphocytosis of CD8+ T cells,
which give rise to the atypical lymphocytes seen on blood ﬁlms.
However, monitoring of lymphocyte subpopulations is of little value,
except in unusual variants of EBV infection.
• There is usually an acute polyclonal rise in immunoglobulins, which
may be associated with the production of autoantibodies.

Immunotherapy
• None is required normally. However, in patients with a persistent EBV
syndrome, high-dose aciclovir (800mg 5 times daily for 14 days) may
lead to remission of symptoms and disappearance of the IgM anti-EBV
antibodies.

87

88

CHAPTER 2

Secondary immunodeﬁciency

• Vaccines are in development, including peptide vaccines.
• Adoptive immunotherapy with EBV-speciﬁc CTL is undergoing trials,
especially in immunosuppressed or immunodeﬁcient patients.

Other viral infections
Cytomegalovirus
• CMV behaves similarly to EBV.
• Early CD8+ T-cell lymphocytosis giving atypical lymphocytes on a
blood ﬁlm.
• Proliferative responses are reduced during acute infections.
• CMV infection of monocytes with production of an IL-1 inhibitor may
be important.
• Congenital CMV infection leads to a prolonged suppression of T-cell
function, and may also suppress antibody production.
• In BMT recipients, there may be prolonged suppression of myeloid
differentiation.
• Reactivation of the disease may occur in the context of
immunosuppression (e.g. HIV, drug therapy).
• High-titre anti-CMV antibodies in the form of IVIg may help to prevent
infection.
• Once infection is established treatment with antivirals (ganciclovir,
foscarnet, cidofovir) is necessary. Valganciclovir is an oral prodrug.

Rubella
• Congenital rubella, but not acute infection, causes poor lymphocyte
responses (reduced PHA proliferation) and may lead to long-term
depressed humoral immune function.
• Hypogammaglobulinaemia and a hyper-IgM syndrome, with transiently
reduced CD40 ligand expression, have been reported.
• Rubella appears to infect both T and B cells directly.

Measles
• Measles virus is capable of infecting both lymphoid and myeloid cells.
• Acute measles depresses cutaneous type IV reactivity (tuberculin
reactivity); this is transient. Similar effects occur with measles vaccines.
• NK activity and immunoglobulin production are suppressed.
• Acute measles may lead to reactivation of TB because of
immunosuppression.
• Acute measles may cause:
• transient lymphopenia
• PHA- and PPD-driven proliferationd.
• transient dneutrophil chemotaxis (?signiﬁcance).
• Early inactivated measles vaccines led to a response predominantly
against viral haemagglutinin but not to the fusion protein, sometimes
leading to an atypical wild-type infection due to inappropriate immune
response.

OTHER VIRAL INFECTIONS

Inﬂuenza virus
• Acute inﬂuenza may give a marked but transient lymphopenia,
accompanied by poor T-cell proliferative responses.

Hepatitis viruses
• Non-speciﬁc immunosuppressive effects are seen, which may be due
to either liver damage or virus.
• Congenital infection with HBV leads to tolerance of the virus and
chronic carriage.
• 5% of normal subjects do not make a humoral response to HBV
vaccines after the normal 3-dose course (>100U). Where evidence of
full seroconversion is required for occupation try the following:
• different brand of vaccine
• double dose may be given (40mcg)
• double dose of vaccine with G-IFN-1b 50mcg/m2—in practice give
100mcg (1 vial) and warn subjects of severe ﬂu-like symptoms.
• Interleukin-2 (1mU) has also been used successfully.

Disseminated warts (papillomavirus)
• May occur as discrete warts or as epidermodysplasia verruciformis
(defects in EVER1/EVER2 genes (see Chapter 1)).
• May be seen in immune deﬁciencies (see Chapter 1)
• common variable immune deﬁciency
• Wiskot-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) and other combined immune
deﬁciencies
• WHIM syndrome.
• Full immunological evaluation required.
• Some patients have no identiﬁable immunological defect.
• May respond to intralesional α-interferon or systemic γ-interferon-1b.
• The potent contact sensitizer diphenylcyclopropenone
(diphencyprone) may also be helpful (not readily available).
• Cimetidine has been used: this is said to improve cell-mediated
immunity by blocking T-cell H2-receptors.
• Imiquimod is a topical agent believed to act by local cytokine induction.
• Irritant agents such as 5-ﬂuorouracil and tretinoin can also be used.
• Intralesional skin test antigens (mumps, Candida, and Trichophyton)
have been used.
• Laser surgery is useful, particularly in WAS, as it prevents excessive
bleeding.
• The role of HPV vaccine is uncertain, but may be beneﬁcial in some
cases.

Post-viral fatigue syndromes
• Chronic fatigue syndromes, accompanied by muscle/joint pains and
neurocognitive symptoms, may occur after a range of viral infections,
including enteroviruses, and vaccines.
• Immunological abnormalities include variable lymphopenia, IgG
subclass abnormalities, and atypical anti-nuclear antibodies.
• May be transient or persistent.
See Chapter 14 for a fuller discussion.

CHAPTER 2

Secondary immunodeﬁciency

Acute bacterial infections
Acute bacterial sepsis may lead to profound changes in immune function
on a temporary basis.

Immunological features
• Neutrophil migration and chemotaxis are increased, while
phagocytosis is normal or decreased.
• Lymphopenia affecting CD4+ and CD8+ cells may be marked.
Signiﬁcant and temporary hypogammaglobulinaemia may be present
(?release of immunosuppressive components from bacteria).
• Massive acute-phase response with elevation of C-reactive protein
(CRP) and other acute-phase proteins (complement, ﬁbrinogen,
protease inhibitors, A2-macroglobulin (IL-6 carrier)), and a reduction in
albumin (negative acute-phase protein).
• Complement components will be consumed rapidly, but synthesis will
be increased (all are acute-phase proteins), so measurements may
be difﬁcult to interpret. Functional assays of complement are usually
highly abnormal.
• Toxic shock may follow certain types of bacterial infection
(staphylococci, streptococci) owing to release of ‘superantigenic’
toxins, which activate many clones of T cells directly, bypassing the
need for MHC on antigen-presenting cells by binding directly to the
T-cell receptor. Effects are likely to be due to cytokine excess.

Immunological investigation
• The most important investigations are microbiological, to identify the
pathogen, by culture and rapid antigen or PCR tests.
• Monitoring of the acute-phase response (CRP) gives a good indication
of response to therapy.
0 Acute measurement of immunoglobulins and complement is usually
misleading and may lead to erroneous diagnoses of antibody or complement deﬁciency. It is best to leave these investigations until convalescence. Functional assays of complement may take 2-3 weeks to
normalize after acute sepsis.
• Acute measurement of cytokines in toxic shock is currently impractical
and the diagnosis is clinical.

Chronic bacterial sepsis
Immunological features
• Hypergammaglobulinaemia is usual, often with small and sometimes
multiple monoclonal bands developing which represent the immune
response against the pathogen.
• Chronic antigenaemia will cause immune complex reactions and
secondary hypocomplementaemia (e.g. subacute bacterial endocarditis
(SBE)).

CHRONIC BACTERIAL SEPSIS

• The acute phase becomes a chronic phase: anaemia of chronic disease,
iron deﬁciency due to sequestration (defence against pathogen) (see
‘Iron deﬁciency and nutritional status’, p.111). There is the risk of
amyloid development (see Chapter 14).
• T-cell function may be signiﬁcantly impaired.
• Mycobacterial infection causes anergy to PPD and third-party antigens.
10% of TB cases do not respond to tuberculin.
• Mycobacterial products (arabino-D-galactan) interfere with in
vitro proliferative responses to PHA, PWM, and PPD; the effect
is possibly via macrophages and may involve prostaglandins
(inhibitable by indomethacin).
• There is often a lymphopenia.
• Persistently raised CRP may also be suppressive.
• Miliary TB may cause neutropenia, generalized bone marrow
suppression, and leukaemoid reactions.
• Untreated leprosy is a potent suppressor of cell-mediated immunity:
T-cell responses to mitogens and antigens are reduced.
• Defect disappears with appropriate antibiotic therapy and appears
to be mediated by a glycolipid.
• Underlying bias of the immune system towards either Th1 (cellular)
or Th2 (antibody) responses determines whether the response to
leprosy is tuberculoid (Th1) or lepromatous (Th2).
• Other immunological features include the development of vasculitis
(erythema nodosum) and glomerulonephritis (assumed to be due
to immune complex with IgG and complement).

Immunological monitoring
• Acute-phase markers provide the best guide to progress and response
to therapy (but beware of elevations from drug reactions). The
erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) is less useful because of its long
half-life.
• Low complement (C3) and elevated C3d indicates immune-complex
reaction (renal involvement likely); monitoring of functional haemolytic
complement is not valuable.
• Immunoglobulins are usually high (polyclonal stimulation ± monoclonal
bands). Electrophoresis also shows elevated A2-macroglobulin, reduced
albumin; beware apparent monoclonal ‘bands’ from very high CRP (use
speciﬁc antisera on immunoﬁxation to demonstrate this).
• Hypogammaglobulinaemia is rare: consider underlying
immunodeﬁciency.
• Measurement of in vitro T-cell function and lymphocyte markers is not
valuable unless there is a suspicion that the infections are due to an
underlying immunodeﬁciency.

Immunotherapy

• G-Interferon offers some possibilities for modifying the Th1:Th2
balance in chronic mycobacterial infections and in leishmaniasis.

91

CHAPTER 2

Secondary immunodeﬁciency

Bronchiectasis
Clinical features
• Syndrome of chronic inﬂammatory/infective airway damage, leading to
chronic cough with sputum production.
• Associated with deﬁciencies of host defence, but may be idiopathic.

Causes
See Table 2.1.
0 Do not use IVIg without evidence of humoral immune deﬁciency
(test immunization required); IgG levels increased in non-immune
bronchiectasis.

Treatment
• Prophylactic azithromycin, 250-500mg 3x/week (has anti-inﬂammatory
activity as well as antibacterial activity).
• Mucolytics (carbocisteine).
• Nebulized antibiotics (colistin).
• Treat underlying cause.

Fungal and parasitic infections
Fungal infections
Except for cutaneous infections, invasive fungal infections are usually the
markers of, rather than the cause of, immunodeﬁciency, indicating defective neutrophil/macrophage and T-cell immunity.

MALIGNANCY

Parasitic infections
Immunological features
• Malaria has no overt effect on cell-mediated immunity but reduces the
humoral immune responses to bacterial antigens (tetanus toxoid,
• Meningococcal polysaccharide, and Salmonella O antigen), presumably
through effects on the spleen. There appears to be little interaction
between HIV infection and malaria where the two diseases overlap.
Tropical splenomegaly due to vivax malaria is associated with a CD8+
T-cell lymphopenia and raised IgM.
• Trypanosomes suppress cellular responses, but there is often a
polyclonal increase of non-speciﬁc immunoglobulin, especially IgM.
• Visceral leishmaniasis is characterized by a polyclonal
hypergammaglobulinaemia, often massive, but with absent cellmediated immunity until after treatment. Splenomegaly may be massive
and there is often lymphopenia. The cachexia and lymphopenia are
mediated by release of tumour necrosis factor-A (TNF-A) by infected
macrophages.
• Many parasites, including malaria and trypanosomes, escape
immunological surveillance by antigenic variation. This occurs under
selection pressure from the immune system. Other avoidance
mechanisms include shedding of surface antigen complexed with
antibody.
• Autoimmunity may occur as a consequence of the chronic infection.
Schistosomiasis is associated with anti-nuclear antibodies including
anti-calreticulin antibodies. Onchocerciasis is also associated with anticalreticulin antibodies (which cross-react with an onchocercal antigen).
• Parasitic infections are associated with excess eosinophil and IgE
responses.
Immunological monitoring
• There is little value in monitoring anything other than the acute-phase
response.

Malignancy
Immunological features
• Malignancy, especially lymphoid, is very common in primary
immunodeﬁciencies (Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, CVID, DNA repair
defects (see Chapter 1)) and in secondary immunodeﬁciencies (HIV,
EBV). Some viruses are directly oncogenic (hepatitis B, EBV).
• Malignancy is also increased in patients with autoimmune disease,
possibly secondary to immunosuppressive drug therapy, and in
transplant patients who are immunosuppressed (skin tumours,
carcinoma of the anogenital tract).
• Abnormalities of T- and NK-cell function may be due to impaired
surveillance or secondary to tumour/treatment.
• T-cell defects include reduction of IL-2 and TNF-A production, and
activation markers such as CD71 (transferrin receptor).

93

94

CHAPTER 2

Secondary immunodeﬁciency

• Cancer cells may release TGF-B, which reduces T-cell proliferative
responses and macrophage metabolism, through inhibitors of
complement.
• Some tumours cause autoimmune responses due to inappropriate
expression of antigens. These may lead to paraneoplastic phenomena,
such as the Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (small cell lung
carcinoma), due to an autoantibody against voltage-gated calcium
channels, and neuronal and retinal autoantibodies in breast, ovarian,
and colonic tumours.
• Major immunosuppression may result from radio- and chemotherapy.
This may be prolonged and lead to secondary infective complications.

Immunological monitoring
• There is little value in immunological monitoring of aspects such as
NK-cell numbers or function.
• Patients with signiﬁcant and persistent infective problems posttreatment may warrant investigation of cellular and humoral immune
function, depending on the type of infections. Lymphocyte surface
markers, immunoglobulins, IgG subclasses, and speciﬁc antibodies to
bacteria and viruses may be appropriate.
• Paraneoplastic phenomena may suggest a search for unusual
autoantibodies (voltage-gated calcium channels, cerebellar Purkinje
cells, retinal antigens) (see Chapter 5).

Immunotherapy
Immunotherapy of solid tumours has had a chequered career.
• IL-2 therapy has been proposed for certain tumours (renal and
melanoma) but there are no good controlled trial data to support this
and it is very toxic.
• In vitro stimulation of non-speciﬁc killers (LAK cell therapy) by IL-2,
using either peripheral blood cells or tumour-inﬁltrating cells, has also
been claimed to be beneﬁcial in small open trials, but is even more
toxic.
• Other immunotherapies tried have included the use of non-speciﬁc
immunostimulants such as BCG, Corynebacterium parvum, and
Bordetella pertussis, often given intralesionally. Occasionally spectacular
results have been achieved.
• A-IFN has been used with success in certain lymphoid disorders (hairy
cell leukaemia, plateau-phase myeloma).
• Monoclonal antibodies are now being introduced targeted against
tumour-speciﬁc antigens, e.g. CD20 (rituximab) in lymphoma,
anti-CD52 in CLL, and anti-Her-2 (trastuzumab) in breast cancer.
• Monoclonal antibodies have also been used to target
radiopharmaceuticals to tumours where the antibody itself may
kill tumour cells poorly (e.g. anti-CD20 monoclonals labelled with
yttrium-90).
• A major beneﬁt of immunotherapy has been in the use of colonystimulating factors to protect the bone marrow, allowing higher doses
of conventional cytotoxic agents to be used. This approach may
increase the risk of secondary myeloid leukaemias.

MYELOMA

Myeloma
Immunological features
• Myeloma is a tumour of plasma cells, leading to clonal proliferation.
A single isolated lesion in bone is referred to as a plasmacytoma.
Waldenström’s macroglobulinaemia is a clonal proliferation of IgMproducing lymphocytes.
• >10% plasma cells in bone marrow.
• Staging of disease depends on bone marrow features, paraprotein
level, calcium, and haemoglobin.
• There may be a genetic background (HLA-Cw2, -Cw5), and IgA
paraproteins may be associated with a translocation t(8;14). Other
translocations may occur; Ig gene rearrangements are detectable
(FISH is the preferred technique).
• Myeloma cells often express lymphocyte and plasma cell antigens
simultaneously. Abnormal B cells may be detectable in the peripheral
blood, expressing high levels of CD44 and CD54. Cells also express
CD56 (NCAM), an adhesion molecule, and soluble levels of NCAM
are elevated in myeloma.
• IL-6 plays a key role as either an autocrine or a paracrine factor
stimulating proliferation. CRP may be raised in consequence.
Osteoclast-activating factors are also produced, leading to bone
destruction (IL-1, IL-6, TNF-B).
• Monoclonal immunoglobulin production parallels the frequency of
B cells: 52% IgG; 22% IgA; 25% free light chain only; 1% IgD. IgE
myeloma is exceptionally rare and is found with plasma cell leukaemia.
Biclonal myeloma and non-secreting tumours may be found.
• Synthesis of heavy and light chains is often discordant and whole
paraprotein may be accompanied by excess free light chains. Free light
chains are readily ﬁltered, but are nephrotoxic. IgD myeloma often
presents in renal failure.
• Hyperviscosity is common with high levels of IgM and IgA paraproteins,
but is rare with IgG and free light-chain paraproteins. IgA frequently
polymerizes in vivo (dimers and tetramers).
• Paraproteins may have autoantibody activity and may be cryoglobulins
(types I and II).
• Complexes of paraproteins (especially IgM) with coagulation factors
may cause bleeding.
• Although myelomatous change probably arises in the spleen or lymph
nodes, these are unusual sites for disease, which is usually found in
bone and bone marrow. Excess clonal plasma cells will be found in the
bone marrow.
• Normal humoral immune function is impaired and there is suppression
of non-paraprotein immunoglobulin (arrest of B-lymphocyte
maturation). Speciﬁc antibody responses are poor.
• T-cell function is also impaired, leading to viral infections.
• Low levels of monoclonal paraproteins are found in other
lymphoproliferative conditions, chronic infections, connective tissue
diseases, and old age.

95

96

CHAPTER 2

Secondary immunodeﬁciency

• Where a paraprotein is present without other features of myeloma
(no increase in plasma cells in bone marrow), the term ‘monoclonal
gammopathy of uncertain signiﬁcance’ is applied. A proportion of these
patients develop myeloma with time, and all should be monitored at
intervals.
• Heavy-chain disease is rare (μ, G, and A); A-heavy-chain disease is the
most likely. All are associated with lymphoma-like disease.
• POEMS syndrome (polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrine
abnormalities, monoclonal gammopathy, and skin rashes) appears
to be a plasma-cell variant of Castleman’s disease, a hyperplasia of
lymph nodes, which may occur with autoimmune diseases (see also
Chapter 4). It is associated with high circulating levels of IL-1, IL-6,
VEGF, and TNF.

Immunological diagnosis and monitoring
• Diagnosis of a paraproteinaemia depends on accurate electrophoresis
of serum and urine, followed by immunoﬁxation. Immunochemical
measurements of immunoglobulin levels (by radial immunodiffusion
(RID) or nephelometry) may be misleading because of polymerization
or, in the case of IgM, monomeric paraprotein.
• Paraprotein levels are best determined by scanning densitometry,
provided that the total protein in serum can be measured accurately.
There are difﬁculties if the M-band overlaps the B-region.
• Urinary light-chain excretion may be helpful as a prognostic monitor
of tumour cell burden, but there are difﬁculties in calculating this (see
Part 2) and renal function affects the output.
• Measurement of serum free light chains is a more sensitive marker of
clonality and tumour burden.
• Serum B2-microglobulin is a marker of tumour-cell activity, but has
fallen out of favour.
• CRP may be a surrogate for IL-6 production.
• The degree of humoral immunodeﬁciency should be assessed by
measurement of exposure and immunization antibodies, followed by
test immunization with protein and polysaccharide antigens.
• Light-chain (AL) amyloid may be a complication.

Immunotherapy
The disease is probably not curable at present.
• Standard chemotherapy includes melphalan and prednisolone; other
agents used include vincristine, doxorubicin (or related drugs),
cyclophosphamide, and carmustine (BiCNU®). Dexamethasone is
usually added.
• A-Interferon has a major effect in prolonging the plateau phase.
• Thalidomide (and a newer derivative, lenalidomide) has been shown to
be valuable, but side effects can be signiﬁcant.
• Bortezomib (Velcade®) is a proteasome inhibitor which has produced
excellent clinical responses. Neutropenia and neuropathy are
signiﬁcant side effects.

LYMPHOMA: HODGKIN’S DISEASE

• HSCT (allogeneic and autologous purged marrow) may also prolong
remission, but it is doubtful if it is curative. Colony-stimulating factors
should be used with caution as they may enhance tumour cell growth.
• Waldenström’s macroglobulinaemia may be treated with ﬂudarabine
or cladribine; rituximab is also helpful.
• Radiotherapy may be required for localized plasmacytomas.
• IVIg may be beneﬁcial in dealing with secondary infective problems but
should be used with great caution in patients with renal impairment
and those with rheumatoid activity of their paraproteins (both may
lead to renal failure). Prophylactic antibiotics may be an alternative.
• Plasmapheresis may be required to deal with hyperviscosity and/or
cryoglobulinaemia.

Monoclonal gammopathy of uncertain signiﬁcance (MGUS)
•
•
•
•
•
•

Asymptomatic premaligant clonal plasma cell disorder.
Found in 3% of population aged >50.
<10% plasma cells in bone marrow.
Chromosomal abnormalities in bone marrow are common (FISH).
Paraprotein <15g/L.
IgG, IgA paraproteins account for 80%; IgM 17%; small number of lightchain-only MGUS.
• Monitor paraproteins at regular intervals—often stable for years
• Rising level indicates development of myeloma.
• Most MGUS will progress to myeloma, given long enough (>20 years
in some cases).

Lymphoma: Hodgkin’s disease
Immunological features
• Hodgkin’s disease (HD) is a lymphoma seen predominantly in the
young. It is characterized by the presence of typical Reed-Sternberg
(RS) cells (CD15, CD30 positive).
• Three major types (nodular sclerosing, mixed cellularity, and
lymphocyte depleted) are recognized. Lymphocyte predominant may
well be a separate disease, as it occurs later and often relapses to nonHodgkin’s lymphoma. Staging depends on the number of sites affected
and on the presence or absence of constitutional symptoms.
• EBV genome is often found in HD, and RS cells are usually positive. RS
cells are thought to be the true neoplastic cell, possibly derived from
interdigitating reticulum cells.
• T- and B-cell numbers are reduced. Immunoglobulins are often raised,
especially IgE. 10% of patients will have hypogammaglobulinaemia
(severe disease). There may be poor speciﬁc antibody responses;
primary antibody responses are impaired, whereas secondary
responses may be normal.
• T-cell proliferation is reduced (reversible by indomethacin, suggesting
a possible macrophage defect). Cutaneous anergy is common.

97

98

CHAPTER 2

Secondary immunodeﬁciency

Responses to Pneumovax II® may be present even if there is a lack of
DTH responses.
• In some cases the defects have been shown to precede the
development of the disease and also to persist long term after
successful treatment (although the role of the cytotoxic regimes in this
is poorly understood). It is difﬁcult then to distinguish from a primary
immunodeﬁciency complicated by lymphoma.
• Bacterial infections are common (Pneumococcus and Haemophilus
inﬂuenzae), related to poor humoral function and possibly also to poor
neutrophil function.
• Before CT scanning became widespread, splenectomy for staging was
common. This is now only undertaken for symptomatic hypersplenism.
Splenectomy has a very signiﬁcant effect on immune function in
lymphoma, and patients may become unresponsive to bacterial
vaccines.

Immunological diagnosis and monitoring
• Diagnosis is made on histological examination of excised lymph
node, supplemented by the use of immunocytochemistry to identify
populations of cells. This may be useful in the identiﬁcation of scanty
RS cells. RS cells may also be found in association with:
• glandular fever
• reactive hyperplasia
• some non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas.
• There is usually a reactive expansion of CD4+ T cells.
• Molecular techniques should be used to look for evidence of EBV
genome.
• HD is associated with an acute-phase response, with elevated ESR,
CRP, and caeruloplasmin. This may be a poor prognostic indicator.
• All patients with lymphoma should be monitored for evidence of
humoral immune deﬁciency: serum immunoglobulins, IgG subclasses,
and speciﬁc antibodies. Test immunization is appropriate. Particular
attention should be paid to apparently cured patients, who may still
have persisting immunodeﬁciency.

Immunotherapy
• Treatment is with radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy. The latter is
used for patients with constitutional (B) symptoms. There are many
regimes for combination chemotherapy.
• Most regimes are myelosuppressive and impose a temporary
secondary defect through neutropenia.
• Relapse can be treated with autologous bone marrow transplantation
(harvested in remission) or with a stem-cell transplant.
• Secondary neoplasms may occur (myelodysplasia, acute myeloid
leukaemia); the risk is related to the intensity of treatment.
• IVIg may be required for those with a persisting symptomatic humoral
defect after treatment.

NON-HODGKIN’S LYMPHOMA

Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma
Immunological features
• This category includes all those lymphoid and histiocytic lymphoid
malignancies that are not Hodgkin’s disease. There are many
classiﬁcations, but the two used most often in the UK are Kiel and the
Working Formulation. A WHO classiﬁcation was introduced in 1999.
Morphology and cellular origin play a major role in classiﬁcation.
• Tumours are also divided on the basis of their clinical grade (=
aggressivity). Low-grade B-cell tumours overlap with chronic
lymphocytic leukaemia. Waldenström’s macroglobulinaemia is
often referred to as an immunocytic lymphoma. Both T- and B-cell
lymphomas are recognized, as well as tumours derived from histiocytic
elements.
• Retrovirus (HTLV-1) has been associated with T-cell lymphomas in
areas where it is endemic (Japan and the Caribbean).
• EBV has been associated with certain B-cell lymphomas, particularly
associated with immunosuppression, and endemic Burkitt’s lymphoma,
which is found in malarial areas. This tumour, but also others, is
associated with chromosomal abnormalities, normally translocations
t(14;8).
• Many other translocations have been identiﬁed. It is thought that these
translocations allow dysregulated activity of cellular oncogenes, such
as bcl-2 and abl, by placing them in proximity to active promoters. In
Burkitt’s lymphoma the oncogene is c-myc.
• Sites of translocations often involve the heavy- and light-chain genes
for immunoglobulin and the genes for T-cell receptors.
• Secondary lymphomas are usually non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL).
These are found with:
• primary immunodeﬁciencies (WAS, CVID, AT, Chediak-Higashi,
DNA repair defects)
• connective tissue diseases (rheumatoid arthritis, Sjögren’s
syndrome, SLE
• phenytoin therapy
• post-transplant (ciclosporin therapy).
• In the case of primary immunodeﬁciency, it is likely that the chronic
infections lead to an abortive immune response that predisposes to
lymphoma. Perhaps earlier diagnosis and better treatment will prevent
this.
• Studies of humoral and cellular function have shown abnormalities
that have not always correlated with the type of lymphoma.
Abnormalities are more likely in high-grade tumours. Both hypo- and
hypergammaglobulinaemia may occur and may persist after treatment.
Monoclonal bands, often IgMκ, may be found in association with B-cell
tumours. Autoantibody activity may be noted.
• Acquired angioedema (AAE) (see Chapter 1) is often associated with
an underlying B-cell lymphoma with a paraprotein:
• paraprotein binds to and inhibits C1-esterase inhibitor.
• the usual tumour in AAE is splenic villous lymphoma.

100

CHAPTER 2

Secondary immunodeﬁciency

• As in Hodgkin’s disease, splenectomy may have been undertaken in
the past, imposing an additional immunological defect. These patients
require careful supervision.

Immunological diagnosis and monitoring
• Diagnosis requires histological examination of lymphoid tissue,
accompanied by immunohistochemistry, using panels of monoclonal
antibodies to identify the predominant cell type.
• Clonality will be established by molecular techniques looking at Ig and
Tcr gene rearrangements.
• Humoral immune function should be monitored as for Hodgkin’s disease.
• Serial B2-microglobulin measurements may be helpful as a marker of
lymphocyte turnover.
• Electrophoresis will demonstrate the presence of paraproteins.
• If autoimmune phenomena are present, association with
the paraprotein can be shown by light-chain restriction on
immunoﬂuorescence.
• Sometimes abnormalities of immunoglobulins precede overt disease. In
contrast with primary immunodeﬁciency, IgM disappears ﬁrst, followed
by IgG and IgA.
0 Finding an isolated but marked reduction of IgM in an older person
should lead to a review for evidence of lymphoma (selective IgM deﬁciency is vanishingly rare!).

Immunotherapy
• Treatment depends on the type of tumour and its grade. Localized
disease may be amenable to radiotherapy, while disseminated disease
will require chemotherapy. Aggressive chemotherapy of high-grade
tumours may result in some cures.
• Autologous bone marrow transplantation may be helpful in relapse.
IVIg may be required if there are infective problems.
• The monoclonal antibody rituximab, with or without and attached
radioisotope, is valuable for treating CD20+ lymphomas.

Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL)
Immunological features
• CLL is a clonal proliferation of small lymphocytes. It is the most
common form of lymphoid leukaemia. 95% are B cell in origin; 5%
are T cell in origin. Other variants include prolymphocytic leukaemia
(B-PLL), hairy cell leukaemia (HCL), and splenic lymphoma with
circulating villous lymphocytes (SLVL). Cell counts may become very
high (>100x109/L). It is predominantly a disease of the elderly (95% of
patients are aged >50 years).
• Different variants can be distinguished by ﬂow cytometry.
• B-CLL is usually CD5+, CD23+, FMC7-, CD22±, with weak surface
Ig. Clonal restriction can usually be demonstrated with anti-lightchain antisera.

CHRONIC LYMPHOCYTIC LEUKAEMIA (CLL)

B-PLL has the phenotype CD5±, CD23-, FMC7+, CD22+, sIg+.
HCL is CD5-, CD23-, FMC7+, CD22+, sIg+.
SLVL is CD5±, CD23±, FMC7+, CD22+, sIg+.
Circulating lymphoma cells can be distinguished because they often
express CD10 (CALLA).
• T-PLL is rare: cells are usually CD4+, CD8-, but dual-positive or
CD4-, CD8+ variants may occur.
• Large granular lymphocytic leukaemia has the phenotype CD4-,
CD8+, CD11b+, CD16/56+, CD57+. The cells may be highly active in
an NK assay.
Bone marrow examination shows an excess of lymphocytes.
Chromosomal abnormalities are common: trisomy 12 and deletions
of the long arm of chromosome 13 in B-cell disease, and chromosome
14 abnormalities (inversion or tandem translocation) or trisomy 8q in
T-cell disease. Deletions of 17p affecting p53 expression have a poorer
prognosis. Recent studies have demonstrated that some CLL patients
have an abnormal ATM gene (ataxia telangiectasia mutated).
Recurrent bacterial infections are a major problem.
Humoral function is impaired and response to Pneumovax II® is a
better predictor of infection than total IgG.
Studies of normal B-cell function is difﬁcult in vitro because of the
predominance of the aberrant clone.
Electrophoresis may show small bands (usually IgM). T-cell numbers
may be increased (CD4+ T cells), but function may be poor with low/
absent PHA responses.
Viral infections may be a problem: shingles with dissemination, HSV.
Autoimmune phenomena are common: ITP and haemolytic anaemia.
Splenectomy may be required and this exacerbates the immune deﬁcit.
Vaccine responses are frequently entirely absent in this situation and
patients must have prophylactic antibiotics.
HCL may be associated with vasculitis.

Immunological diagnosis and monitoring
• Diagnosis of straightforward CLL is usually possible from the white
count and examination of the ﬁlm. Conﬁrmation requires ﬂow
cytometry and examination of the bone marrow.
• Studies of humoral immune function are necessary and should include
test immunization with Pneumovax II®. As these diseases are chronic,
monitoring should be carried out at regular intervals to identify
deterioration.

Immunotherapy
• Treatment is with cytotoxic agents. Chlorambucil is the usual agent
but ﬂudarabine, deoxycorfomycin, and cladribine are highly effective.
The last named produces a state similar to ADA deﬁciency. This
leads to a profound immunosuppression, with T-cell lymphopenia
and a signiﬁcant risk of opportunistic infections. Patients treated with
these agents should have regular T-cell counts by ﬂow cytometry and
receive prophylactic co-trimoxazole and irradiated blood products
(risk of engraftment).

101

102

CHAPTER 2

Secondary immunodeﬁciency

• A-Interferon is very effective in HCL. Rituximab or ofatumumab
(anti-CD20) is valuable in combination with ﬂudarabine and
cyclophosphamide. The humanized monoclonal antibody
Campath-1H® (alemtuzumab) has been used in resistant cases with
success, but causes profound immunosuppression. Younger patients
may be candidates for HSCT (autologous BMT is not curative).
• Recurrent infections may require prophylactic antibiotics or IVIg.
Monthly treatment is usually adequate (dose 200-400mg/kg).

Chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) and
myelodysplastic syndromes
Immunological features
• Chromosomal abnormalities occur in almost all cases of CML and
myelodysplastic syndromes. The Philadelphia chromosome (t(9;22))
is the most common, but others have been described, including the
5q-syndrome, monosomy 7, trisomy 8, 19, or 20, and deletions on
other chromosomes (12 and 20). The deletions of chromosome 5 are
of interest because they map to the region containing the genes for
IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, G-CSF, and GM-CSF.
• There is a high incidence of progression to acute myeloid leukaemia.
• Abnormal neutrophil function is well described: neutropenia is
common in myelodysplasia. Even if the neutrophil count is normal,
function is often not, with abnormalities of adhesion, chemotaxis,
phagocytosis, and bacterial killing being well documented. This occurs
particularly with monosomy 7 in childhood.
• Infections are common.

Acute leukaemias
Overview
• Acute leukaemia is a common malignancy of childhood, and accounts
for about 30-40% of paediatric malignancy. 80% of cases are due to
acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL).
• Certain primary immunodeﬁciencies are risk factors for ALL (Bloom’s
syndrome, ataxia telangiectasia, Schwachmann’s syndrome, xeroderma
pigmentosa). Most ALLs are B cell in origin.
• T-ALL is associated strongly with HTLV-1 infection in areas where this
virus is endemic.
• A number of chromosomal translocations have been described,
including the Philadelphia translocation (t(9;22)), which is common in
adult ALL. Other translocations are well described.
• T-ALL is often associated with translocations involving the T-cell
receptor genes.

ACUTE LEUKAEMIAS

• ALL is classiﬁed according to the FAB classiﬁcation, on the basis of
cytological appearance, into L1, L2, and L3 types. Immunophenotyping
allows the distinction of B-, T-, and null (rare) ALLs.
• Acute myeloid leukaemia has also been classiﬁed by the FAB group
into M0-M7, depending on the predominant cell type identiﬁed by
morphology and cytochemistry. Cases of AML may be secondary
to Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, Chediak-Higashi syndrome, or
Fanconi anaemia, as well as to the use of cytotoxic drugs such as
cyclophosphamide.
• Occasionally, biphenotypic leukaemias may be detected, deﬁned as
the presence of at least two markers from each lineage (e.g. lymphoid
and myeloid). They account for 5-10% of acute leukaemias and tend to
have a poor prognosis. Often they present as AML, but have evidence
of clonal rearrangements of immunoglobulin and Tcr genes.

Immunological features
• In ALL the immune system is usually normal, although primary IgM
responses to some antigens (viruses), may be poor.
• Secondary immune responses are usually normal.
• Non-neoplastic cells are normally present in normal numbers.
• Leukaemic clones rarely have functional activity, although there have
been reports of cytokine production.
• Rare cases may be hypogammaglobulinaemic at presentation.
• Chemotherapy is profoundly immunosuppressive, affecting both
T- and B-cell function and rendering patients neutropenic. Careful
attention to prevention of infection (isolation, irradiation of food, gut
decontamination) is essential.

Immunological diagnosis
• Diagnosis of leukaemia is usually made on the basis of suspicious
blood ﬁlms, supplemented by immunophenotyping of both peripheral
blood and bone marrow, to identify the characteristics of the
leukaemic clone. This is supplemented by genetic analysis to identify
any translocations: probes to the sites of recombination for these
translocations give a very sensitive tool for detecting minimal residual
disease in bone marrow after treatment.
2 Leukaemia phenotyping is best undertaken by haematologists who will
have access to supportive evidence from blood ﬁlms, bone marrow
smears, and trephines, as well as cytochemical enzymatic studies. They
will also undertake the therapy.
• Monitoring of humoral and cellular function post-treatment, and
especially after BMT, is essential.

Immunotherapy
• The management of ALL involves intensive chemo- and radiotherapy
to sanctuary sites such as the nervous system (often with intrathecal
methotrexate). For relapse or high-risk patients bone marrow or
stem cell transplantation is used, either matched unrelated donors or
purged autologous if an HLA-identical donor is not available. There is a
high risk of long-term development of NHL and AML.

103

104

CHAPTER 2

Secondary immunodeﬁciency

• AML is treated similarly with intensive chemotherapy, with the option
for BMT/HSCT when remission is obtained. Acute promyelocytic
leukaemia associated with the t(15;17) translocation may be treated
with all-trans retinoic acid, which allows differentiation of the blocked
cells to mature neutrophils, although BMT is still required.
• Certain cytokines may have a role as adjunctive agents, allowing
intensiﬁcation of chemotherapy, but with the increased risk of later
myeloid lineage leukaemias.

Bone marrow and stem cell
transplantation
• Bone marrow transplantation (BMT) and stem cell transplantation
(HSCT) are part of the treatment for a variety of inherited diseases
(SCID and SCID variants, CGD, HIGM, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome,
osteopetrosis, Gaucher’s disease) in addition to its role in the acute
leukaemias and CML with blast transformation. The process is
discussed in more detail in Chapter 15.
• BMT leads to an immediate severe immunodeﬁciency because of
the conditioning required to allow ‘take’. All blood products must
be irradiated to prevent viable lymphocytes engrafting and must be
CMV-.
• There follows a period of gradually improving immune function while
the immune system reconstitutes. This recapitulates immunological
ontogeny.
• T-cell function reconstitutes early, but full B-cell function may take up
to 2 years. IgG2 levels may remain depressed, and there are frequently
poor responses to polysaccharide antigens.
• Degree of reconstitution is affected by the degree of mismatch and by
GvHD.
• Return of T-cell function in vitro (positive PHA) is usually taken to
deﬁne the time when release from isolation is safe, but this is usually
the last parameter to normalize. Anti-CD3 stimulation responses
usually return early.
• Appearance of recent thymic emigrants may be detected by
measurement of TRECs (T-cell receptor excision circles) and by the
use of CD45RA and CD27 to deﬁne naive and effector CD4+ T-cell
reappearance.
• While B-cell function is poor during the acute phase and for the ﬁrst
year thereafter, IVIg prophylaxis is essential.
• Return of B-cell function can be monitored by IgA/IgM levels and
development of isohaemagglutinins. Reappearance of class-switch
memory B cells is also valuable, especially in patients transplanted for
hyper-IgM syndromes.
• Once off IVIg, a full programme of immunizations should be
undertaken, starting with killed vaccines (killed polio, DPT, Hib, and
Pneumovax II®). The response to these can be assessed (pre- and

EXTREMES OF AGE: PREMATURITY

post-levels are required, and remember that antibody from IVIg may
persist for up to 6 months or longer).
• Once there is a good response to killed/subunit vaccines, live vaccines
can be administered (MMR).
• Immunological function in chronic GvHD is markedly abnormal, with
a persisting risk of invasive infections of all types. The gastrointestinal
involvement superimposes a severe nutritional defect, which further
reduces immune function.

Extremes of age: prematurity
• Following birth, infants are dependent for the ﬁrst 6 months of life on
maternally transferred immunoglobulin (IgG only).
• Immune function gradually develops, although there is usually a
physiological trough in IgG levels at around 6 months. If this is
prolonged, transient hypogammaglobulinaemia of infancy results
(Chapter 1).
• Additional protection to the neonatal gut is provided by breastfeeding,
particularly in the ﬁrst few days when the IgA-rich colostrum is
produced.
• Maternal antibody transfer is an active process in the placenta which
begins at around 14 weeks’ gestation and accelerates markedly after
22 weeks. The process can take place against a concentration gradient
and is selective for some IgG subclasses; IgG2 is transferred relatively
less well.
• Antibody-deﬁcient mothers will also be at risk of producing
hypogammaglobulinaemic infants, who will require IVIg for the ﬁrst
6 months of life. Good replacement therapy during pregnancy will
obviate the need for this.
• Premature delivery interrupts the placental transfer and leaves the
infant deﬁcient in immunoglobulins and with a relatively less mature
humoral and cellular immune system. Breastfeeding is rarely possible,
but oral administration of colostrum is desirable to prevent necrotizing
enterocolitis. Infections are often problematic, although other factors,
such as ITU nursing, venous and arterial lines, and lung immaturity,
all contribute. Group B streptococcal infections are particularly
troublesome.

Immunological features and diagnosis
• All immunoglobulins will be low, as will IgG subclasses. However, the
‘normal’ ranges are calculated from full-term delivery.
• Provided that there are no major complications, the immune system
rapidly catches up after delivery and there are rarely long-term
sequelae.
• Responses to standard immunization schedules may be poor—
consider boosters.

105

106

CHAPTER 2

Secondary immunodeﬁciency

Immunotherapy
• The role of IVIg replacement as routine for premature infants has been
investigated extensively, with conﬂicting results, and a consensus as to
its value is difﬁcult to obtain.
• Differences in products and batches may relate to highly variable
levels of anti-group B streptococcal antibodies.
• Better products, enriched for speciﬁc antibodies to the problem
pathogens, may be required.
• Oral IgA-rich products have also been used to reduce the risk of
enterocolitis.
• Immunization of the premature causes problems in timing, as there
may be very poor responses if routine immunizations are given at
intervals calculated from date of delivery uncorrected for gestational
age.

Extremes of age: the elderly
Immunological changes in the elderly are multifactorial, relating to the
decline in normal immunoregulatory processes, the increased incidence of
disease, and the increased use of drugs. Nutritional status is also important. There is no relationship to chronological age.

Immunological features
• There is no signiﬁcant change in lymphocyte numbers or subsets in
the healthy elderly, although lymphoid organs show a reduction of
germinal centres.
• Thymic function declines, but not as much as previously assumed!
• NK-cell numbers increase in the long-lived elderly.
• Mucosal immunity seems to be reasonably intact, although the nonspeciﬁc inﬂammatory response is reduced.
• Aged lymphocytes have metabolic abnormalities such as reduced
5 -nucleotidase activity (also associated with CVID), and there are
changes in the expression of surface antigens.
• Immunoglobulin levels change with age: IgG and IgA tend to rise
while IgM and IgE fall. Primary humoral responses are reduced and
secondary responses give lower peak titres and a more rapid fall with
time. Antibody afﬁnity may also be poorer. Some studies have shown
that vaccine responses in the elderly may be as good as in younger
people.
• CVID may present for the ﬁrst time post-retirement, but this diagnosis
should only be entertained when other secondary causes have been
eliminated.
• With increasing age there is an increasing incidence of small
monoclonal bands on electrophoresis (MGUS), such that 20% of
95-year-olds will have bands. These are present at low levels and are
rarely of great signiﬁcance.
• There is a parallel increase in autoantibodies of all types. These are
usually present at low titres and are not associated with disease.

TRANSFUSION THERAPY

•

•

•

•

•

Normal ranges for antibody titres should be adjusted to take account
of these changes.
Cell-mediated immunity, as tested by mitogen responses and DTH
testing, are also reduced in the elderly. Thymic function is probably
better than previously thought and new thymic emigrants can be
detected in the elderly.
Biologically, the healthy very elderly (>85 years old) represent a
special group. There may be combinations of MHC genes that can
be associated with survival (in Japan, a high frequency of DR1 and
a low frequency of DR9), but this might be due to selection out of
those individuals with less favourable MHC types associated with
autoimmune disease.
Coexisting disease imposes additional strains on the immune system
(e.g. chronic lung disease from smoking, cardiac failure with pulmonary
oedema, and malnutrition). These often tip the balance away from the
immune system in favour of invading pathogens.
Diseases such as inﬂuenza have a disproportionate effect on the
elderly through the risks of secondary bacterial infection and
exacerbation of pre-existing underlying diseases. Infections common
in early childhood, such as meningitis, are also more common in the
elderly.
CMV has been suggested as an important risk factor for immunological
decay.

Immunological diagnosis
• The investigation of the elderly for immunodeﬁciency should be
symptom-driven.

Immunotherapy
• Preventative vaccination of at-risk groups is thought to be helpful, for
instance with inﬂuenza vaccine and Pneumovax II®. At-risk groups are
those with underlying signiﬁcant disease, particularly chronic lung disease.
• Protection may be poor because of the underlying decay of
immune function!
• Consideration should also be given to ensuring that other vaccines
such as tetanus are kept up to date (this tends to be forgotten in the
elderly) as tetanus antibodies may fall below protective levels. Keen
gardeners are at most risk.
• Immunoglobulin therapy may be required for those with signiﬁcant
symptomatic hypogammaglobulinaemia.

Transfusion therapy
• In addition to immediate reactions to blood products due to
transfused white cells, pre-formed antibodies (to HLA or IgA), etc.,
there is evidence for an immunosuppressive effect. This is most
noticeable in the effect on renal allograft survival (Chapter 14).
• IVIg has complex immunoregulatory properties when used in high
doses (Chapter 16).

107

108

CHAPTER 2

Secondary immunodeﬁciency

• Crude factor VIII concentrates are immunosuppressive, although this
may relate as much to chronic hepatitis due to hepatitis C. High-purity
FVIII is much less immunosuppressive.
• Other infections transmissible by blood, such as HIV and CMV, can
have major immunosuppressive effects.
• The use of unirradiated blood in the immunocompromised (with poor/
absent cell-mediated immunity (CMI)) may lead to engraftment of
viable lymphocytes and the development of GvHD.
• Lymphocytes may be viable for up to 2 weeks in bank blood.

Chronic renal disease (nephrotic
syndrome and uraemia)
Nephrotic syndrome
• Renal protein loss should always be considered when investigating
hypogammaglobulinaemia.
• Investigation of humoral function is essential if there is signiﬁcant
proteinuria.
• In the nephrotic syndrome there is an increased susceptibility to
Pneumococcus and other streptococci.
• Typical pattern is loss of immunoglobulins in order of ascending
molecular weight, depending on the selectivity of the proteinuria, with
preferential loss of IgG and then IgA, and preservation of IgM until
gross nephrosis ensues.
• The IgG synthetic rate is normal or increased and the IgM catabolic
rate is normal.
• Responses to Pneumovax II® are poor, but responses to inﬂuenza are
normal.
• Poor neutrophil chemotaxis and opsonization are also described.
• Loss of complement proteins such as C3 and factor B may also
contribute to poor bacterial handling through decreased opsonization.

Uraemia
• Chronic uraemia is immunosuppressive with poor humoral and cellular
immune responses. The molecules responsible for this are uncertain.
• Lymphopenia is common, affecting CD4+ and CD8+ T cells; DTH and
mitogen responses are reduced.
• Immunoglobulins and speciﬁc antibody responses to pneumococcal
and hepatitis B vaccines may be low. Double doses of HBV vaccines
(40mcg) are advised.
• Lymph nodes show a loss of secondary follicles.
• Neutrophil function shows defective chemotaxis and phagocytosis,
with impaired oxidative metabolism, leading to poor bacterial killing.
• Certain types of dialysis membrane (cellophane, now no longer
used) activate the alternate pathway of complement, with release of
anaphylotoxins and neutrophil activation leading to severe circulatory
and respiratory problems.

PROTEIN-LOSING ENTEROPATHY AND LIVER DISEASE (CIRRHOSIS)

• Dialysis patients often have a CD4+ T-cell lymphopenia; increased
expression of CD11b/CD18 is seen on neutrophils. Increased T-cell
apoptosis may occur.

Renal transplantation
• Renal transplant recipients will be on long-term immunosuppressive
therapy.
• Increased risk of HPV-induced skin tumours, EBV-induced lymphomas,
and B-lymphoproliferative disease.
• Por humoral and cellular immune function.
• Monitoring is required, especially if irreversible lymphocytoxic agents
such as azathioprine are used long-term.

Protein-losing enteropathy and
liver disease (cirrhosis)
Protein-losing enteropathy
Causes
• Secondary hypogammaglobulinaemia may be due to protein-losing
enteropathy, for which there are many causes:
• Ménétrier’s disease (giant rugal hypertrophy)
• coeliac disease and other types of sprue
• inﬂammatory bowel disease (Crohn’s disease)
• infections—hookworm, TB
• ﬁstulae post-gastrectomy syndrome
• neoplasms
• allergic gut disease (eosinophilic gastropathy)
• secondary to constrictive pericarditis and gross right heart failure
• Whipple’s disease
• chylous effusions
• intestinal lymphangiectasia (dilated lymphatics).
Immunological features
• Immunoglobulins are low, with a short half-life, but the synthetic rate
may be increased.
• Speciﬁc antibody responses may be normal, although they may decline
rapidly.
• Lymphopenia is associated with dilated or blocked lymphatics
(intestinal lymphangiectasia, constrictive pericarditis, right heart
failure). This may lead to poor mitogen responses and DTH reactions.
Diagnosis
• Proof that the bowel is the source of immunoglobulin and cellular
loss is difﬁcult as most laboratories are singularly reluctant to try to
measure faecal immunoglobulin excretion! Whole-bowel perfusion
studies may make this more tolerable.
• Radiolabelled albumin excretion in the faeces will quantitate the loss.

109

110

CHAPTER 2

Secondary immunodeﬁciency

• Full studies of humoral and cellular function are required, together
with investigation of the underlying cause (radiology, endoscopy, and
biopsy).

Liver disease (cirrhosis)
• Increased infections with bacteria and mycobacteria are seen
(especially with alcohol which directly impairs macrophage function).
• Complement components are reduced (decreased synthesis).
• Neutrophil phagocytosis and chemotaxis occur.
• T-cell function is poor.

Metabolic disorders
A number of metabolic diseases are associated with concomitant immunological impairment.
• Glycogenosis type Ib: neutropenia and neutrophil migration defect.
Recurrent infections are a problem: septicaemia, wound infections,
osteomyelitis, and sinusitis.
• Mannosidosis: recurrent severe infections; impaired neutrophil
chemotaxis. Poor T-cell responses to PHA and concanavalin A
(ConA).
• Galactosaemia: increased risk of Gram-negative septicaemia due to
abnormalities of neutrophil motility and phagocytosis.
• Myotonic dystrophy: hypercatabolism of IgG, but not albumin, IgA, or
IgM, may occur, although infections are not usually a major problem.
• Sickle cell disease: increased susceptibility to meningitis and
septicaemia. There is an acquired splenic dysfunction due to infarction.
Tissue hypoxia also contributes to bacterial infection. Serum
immunoglobulins and vaccine responses are usually normal, even to
polysaccharide antigens. It is recommended that all patients should be
treated as other asplenic or hyposplenic patients, and should receive
Pneumovax II® and Hib vaccines and be considered for prophylactic
antibiotics.
• Coeliac disease: this may be accompanied by splenic atrophy, and these
patients should be investigated and treated as other asplenic patients.
• Prolidase deﬁciency: rare autosomal disorder with rashes, skin
ulceration, dysmorphic features, splenomegaly, and recurrent
infections. It also appears to be associated with a risk of developing
SLE. It is diagnosed by the presence of iminopeptiduria.

Diabetes mellitus
Immunological mechanisms
• There is an underlying genetic susceptibility to type I diabetes
(the MHC type is shared with CVID) and consequent immune
dysregulation. As a result of the association with the A1, B8, DR3,

IRON DEFICIENCY AND NUTRITIONAL STATUS

•

•

•

•
•
•
•

C4Q0 haplotype, there is an increased incidence of C4 deﬁciency in
diabetes.
In established disease, the raised glucose itself interferes with both
innate and speciﬁc immune functions. Most of the research has been
done on chemically induced or genetic diabetes in mice; much less
work has been done on human diabetes.
Humoral function is impaired: IgG levels may be reduced, while IgA
may be increased. Speciﬁc antibody responses may show poor primary
immune responses and the non-enzymatic glycation of immunoglobulin
may interfere with function. Both T-dependent and T-independent
antigens are affected.
Lymphoid organs are essentially normal, but peripheral blood
lymphocytes may show variable abnormalities. CMI may be depressed
with poor DTH responses, abnormal mitogen responses, and poor
cytokine production (IL-2).
Macrophage and neutrophil function is also reduced.
Type I diabetes is strongly associated with coeliac disease; hyposplenia
may occur.
Infections with Candida and other fungi, TB, and pneumococci are
more common in diabetes. Staphylococcal colonization of the skin is
higher in diabetics than in normal individuals.
Abnormalities of immune function are more marked in type I
diabetes but correlate poorly with blood glucose levels. It is possible
that immune dysfunction relates to glycation of surface antigens on
immunologically important cells.

Diagnosis and treatment
• Recurrent infections in diabetics should be investigated in the normal
way and not merely accepted, particularly if diabetic control is not bad.
This should include humoral and neutrophil function.
• In the USA, regular pneumococcal vaccination is recommended, but
this policy has not been adopted in the UK.

Iron deﬁciency and nutritional status
Iron deﬁciency
• Induced sideropenia due to sequestration is part of the body’s
response to chronic infection, as iron is essential to bacteria. However,
it is also essential to host defences.
• Iron deﬁciency due to loss or inadequate intake impairs
neutrophil bactericidal activity, as it is essential for the activity of
myeloperoxidase. There is often a T lymphopenia. Immunoglobulins
are usually normal but speciﬁc antibody production is reduced. All the
changes are reversible with iron.

Nutritional status
• The immunodeﬁciency of malnutrition is difﬁcult to disentangle
because it is usually accompanied by multiple other health problems,
which make identiﬁcation of cause and effect impossible.

111

112

CHAPTER 2

Secondary immunodeﬁciency

• Marasmus is total nutritional deﬁciency, while kwashiorkor is protein
deﬁciency in a high-calorie diet. Both are usually accompanied by
vitamin deﬁciency.
• Increased susceptibility to infection seems to be the rule.
• Non-speciﬁc barriers are impaired (especially in vitamin A deﬁciency).
• There may be variable abnormalities of neutrophil bactericidal activity,
but these may well be secondary to infection.
• Immunoglobulins are often normal or high, even if the albumin is low.
IgE levels may be elevated, even in the absence of signiﬁcant parasitic
infections, suggesting dysregulation of the Th1/Th2 axis.
• Mitogen responsiveness is reduced in kwashiorkor. Lymph nodes show
germinal centre depletion and there is thymic atrophy, although the
latter is also a feature of infection.

Asplenia
• Congenital or acquired asplenia (surgery, trauma) or hyposplenia
(sickle cell disease, coeliac disease) is associated with an increased
susceptibility to overwhelming infection with capsulated organisms,
Capnocytophaga canimorsus (dog bites), and problems in handling
malaria, Babesia, and Bartonella (all intra-erythrocytic organisms).
• Risk appears to be lifelong and is not limited to the ﬁrst 2-3 years after
splenectomy, as was previously thought.
• Degree of compromise also depends on the reason for splenectomy.
For example, individuals splenectomized for lymphomas often have a
more severe defect than those splenectomized for trauma.
• Ideally, all patients undergoing elective splenectomy should be
immunized with Pneumovax II® and Hib vaccine and probably with
the quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate vaccine preoperatively. If
this is not possible, immunization prior to discharge may be adequate,
although responses immediately post-surgery will be reduced.
• The value of conjugated pneumococcal vaccines as routine ﬁrst-line
vaccines in asplenic/hyposplenic patients is uncertain.
• All asplenic patients should be on prophylactic antibiotics (preferably
penicillin V 500mg twice daily); erythromycin can be used for penicillinallergic patients. Where there is a high level of pencillin-resistant
pneumococci (Mediterranean countries), amoxicillin 500mg daily can
be used.
• Patients should have their antibodies to Pneumovax II® and Hib
measured annually. Those with suboptimal levels should be (re)
immunized and the levels rechecked.
• Those with poor responses to Pneumovax II® should receive the
conjugated pneumococcal vaccine Prevenar®.
• Repeated doses of Pneumovax II® close together should be avoided, as
this may induce tolerance rather than boost immunity.

BURNS

• Annual inﬂuenza immunization is essential to reduce risks of secondary
bacterial sepsis.
• Asplenic patients may also not maintain adequate levels following
vaccination for more than 3-5 years, and regular checks should be
carried out to ensure that protection is adequate. Note that the
licence for Pneumovax II® does not indicate that it can be given
this frequently. However, provided that steps are taken to avoid
immunizing patients with high antibody levels, the risk of adverse
events appears to be low.
• Dog bites are dangerous and patients must seek immediate assistance.
Antibiotic treatment is essential.
• Speciﬁc advice is required for foreign travel to malarial areas—refer to
the Infectious Disease Team for advice.

Drugs and toxins
Drugs
In addition to the drugs discussed in Chapter 16, the major therapeutic action of which is immunosuppression, other drugs have also been
reported to cause immunodeﬁciency. In many cases the evidence is poor
because pre-existing immunodeﬁciency has not been excluded. However,
anticonvulsants, especially phenytoin and carbamazepine, have strong
associations with humoral immune deﬁciency, which may or may not
resolve on withdrawal of the drugs. Newer anticonvulsants may also be
associated with humoral immunodeﬁciency.

Toxins
• Smoking suppresses mucosal immune responses, improving some
allergic diseases such as allergic alveolitis.
• Illegal drugs have considerable immunosuppressive potential, in part
due to contaminants. Cannabis is particularly dangerous to severely
immunocompromised patients as it may contain fungal spores.
• Alcohol in excess suppresses macrophage function, and as result
increases the risk of tuberculosis.

Burns
• Burns cause a highly signiﬁcant acquired T- and B-cell
immunodeﬁciency.
• Disruption of the integrity of the normal cutaneous barriers and
associated non-speciﬁc defences is a serious problem. Complement
levels will be reduced by loss.
• In severe burns neutrophil function is impaired and there is a
lymphopenia, with depletion of lymphoid organs.
• DTH, mitogen, and allogeneic responses are reduced.

113

114

CHAPTER 2

Secondary immunodeﬁciency

• These changes may be stress-related owing to excessive endogenous
steroid production (Curling’s ulcer is also associated) or the release of
bacterial products at the burned site.
• Immunoglobulin levels fall, often dramatically, because of reduced
synthesis and increased loss through exudation. However, there is no
beneﬁt from IVIg replacement therapy.
• The best treatment is good intensive care and rapid grafting to
re-establish normal barrier function.

Thoracic duct drainage
• This was previously used as an immunosuppressive technique for the
treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.
• It usually occurs now as an unintended consequence of radical
oesophageal surgery; chylothorax results, usually draining through the
surgical drains.
• Loss of the circulating lymphocyte pool occurs within 48-72 hours
and leads to severe prolonged lymphopenia, followed by severe
panhypogammaglobulinaemia.
• Opportunist infections (PCP, Candida) occur.
• Chylothorax should be drained to the abdominal cavity if possible to
allow conservation of lymphocytes. IVIg will be required, together with
prophylactic co-trimoxazole, antivirals, and antifungals.
• Reconstitution of the immune system depends on thymic function
and may take up to 2 years. Once normal lymphocyte numbers are
achieved, a programme of re-immunization is required, commencing
with killed/subunit vaccines.

Cardiac surgery in children
• Cardiac surgery in children <2 years old is frequently associated with
secondary immunodeﬁciency (?due to thymic disruption).
• Poor development of humoral immune responses.
• Test immunization may be required.
• Poor antibody function and history of infections are indications for the
use of IVIg therapy.
• IVIg has also been used in adult cardiac transplant patients with
hypogammaglobulinaemia and infections.

Physical and environmental factors
Radiotherapy and ionizing radiation
• Speciﬁc immune responses are affected (T and B cells); neutrophil and
macrophage function is usually spared unless there is radiation damage
to bone marrow.

YELLOW NAIL SYNDROME

• T-cell proliferative responses to mitogens and antigens remain
depressed after irradiation for years.
• Lymphopenia, particularly of CD4+ T cells, is common; humoral
immune function is reduced.

Ultraviolet light
• Photoimmunosupprression occurs even with low levels of UV light
exposure.
• Apoptosis may be increased.
• NFκB in T cells is activated by UV light.

Chronic hypoxia (altitude)
• Increased infections are noted at high altitude.
• Hypoxic therapy has been used as an adjunct to sports conditioning;
this is associated with measurable alterations in circulating lymphocyte
proﬁles, although the patterns are not consistent.

Trauma and surgery
• Systemic inﬂammatory response syndrome (SIRS) is recognized in
trauma and major surgery. It is caused by cytokine release (TNFA,
IL-1B, IL-6) and may lead to multi-organ failure.
• A Th1 to Th2 switch and reduced T-cell proliferation have been
noted, but this is in part mediated by prostaglandin release from
macrophages.
• Antibody production is inhibited by B-endorphin (reversible by
naloxone).
• Prolonged administration of anaesthetic agents in the ITU may
contribute to worse immune function.
• Preventing tissue hypoxia is crucial (supplemental oxygen).

Proteus syndrome
• A hamartomatous condition with partial gigantism of hands and feet,
pigmentary lesions, bony abnormalities, multiple benign tumours
(lipoma, haemangioma), and developmental delay.
• Hypogammaglobulinaemia has been reported.

Yellow nail syndrome
• Rare syndrome of pleural effusions, lymphoedema, and yellow
dystrophic nails.
• Cause uncertain.
• Associated with bronchiectasis in 40% of cases.
• May respond to high dose vitamin E.

115

116

CHAPTER 2

Secondary immunodeﬁciency

Cilial dyskinesia (Kartagener’s
syndrome)
• Rare autosomal recessive disease with defective cilia.
• Poor/absent cilial function.
• Genetics complex: 38% of dynein mutations are associated with
DNAI1 and DNAH5 (the latter is associated with situs inversus).
• Clinical features include:
• sinusitis, otitis media, hearing loss
• bronchitis, recurrent pneumonia, bronchiectasis
• infertility
• situs inversus (partial or complete—Kartagener’s syndrome
• asplenia/hyposplenia
• other related ciliopathies (http://ciliopathyalliance.org.uk, http://
wwwpcdsupport.org.uk).
• Treatment includes aggressive anti-infective treatment to prevent
infection-related lung damage.
• Manage asplenia as described above on p.112 (‘Asplenia’).

Young’s syndrome
• Rare syndrome of rhinosinusitis, recurrent chest infections, and
bronchiectasis, associated with azoospermia.
• Possibly secondary to contact with mercury.
• Cilial function is normal.

Cystic ﬁbrosis (CF)
• Autosomal recessive disease causing respiratory and pancreatic
damage.
• Clinical features include:
• chronic sinusitis
• bronchitis, bronchiectasis
• recurrent pulmonary staphylococcal infections
• malabsorption
• failure to thrive
• infertility.
• Disease is caused by mutations in the CF transmembrane conductance
regulator (CFTR, chromosome 7q31.2). Heterozygosity for the
mutated gene is common in Caucasian populations.
• Many mutations are described: some are compatible with longevity
and late presentation.
• Genetics should be checked in all patients presenting as adults with
bronchiectasis/recurrent chest infections where there is no other
explanation, particularly if there are recurrent staphylococcal chest
infections.
• Coexistent MBL deﬁciency is associated with worse prognosis.

ALPHA-1-ANTITRYPSIN DEFICIENCY (A1-AT DEFICIENCY)

• Aspergillus colonization may occur; development of IgE to Aspergillus is
a poor prognostic sign.
• Chronic carriage of Pseudomonas and Burkholderia tend to be late
events and are poor prognostic indicators. These patients need to be
segregated to avoid infecting other patients.
• Aggressive antibiotic therapy is required; malabsorption and secondary
diabetes are managed normally.
• Lung transplantation is successful.

Alpha-1-antitrypsin deﬁciency
(A1-AT deﬁciency)
• Autosomal co-dominant genetic disorder leading to reduced levels of
A1-AT.
• Causes neonatal jaundice, cirrhosis, and liver failure.
• Later in life, emphysema (rarely bronchiectasis), especially in smokers,
and panniculitis and angioedema.
• >80 genetic variants identiﬁed by isoelectric focusing (for main types
see Table 2.2).
• Severe cases have been treated with infusions of A1-AT.
• Smoking avoidance is crucial to prevent accelerated lung damage.

CHAPTER 3

Allergic disease

Introduction
Allergic diseases are common: it has been estimated that 15% of the population will suffer from some sort of allergic reaction during their lifetime. It
is clear that there has been an increase in atopic diseases since the Second
World War. The precise cause of this change is unknown but undoubtedly reﬂects changes in lifestyle, in particular ‘improvements’ in housing,
rendering houses more heavily colonized with dust mites. A reduction in
breastfeeding may also have contributed, particularly to atopic eczema.
The evidence for air pollution, particularly car exhaust fumes, contributing to the increase is conﬂicting. It is also likely that the improvements in
public health, leading to elimination of parasitic infections in the Western
world, may contribute through a lack of physiological function for the
IgE-mast cell axis. This has been formalized in the hygiene hypothesis (‘dirt
is good for you!’).
In the mind of the public, allergy is responsible for all ills, but in most
cases the blame is wrongly apportioned. This perception has led to a
proliferation of alternative practices pandering to these beliefs and using
diagnostic techniques and treatments that have little to do with allergy
as understood by immunologists and more to do with the gullibility of
members of the public. That these practitioners can ﬂourish indicates that
we are failing our patients in being unable to cure their perceived illnesses,
either through lack of knowledge or through lack of appropriate allergy
facilities.

Anaphylaxis
Anaphylaxis represents the most severe type of allergic reaction and a
medical emergency.

Cause
• Sudden massive degranulation of mast cells, releasing histamine.
• Mast cells are stimulated to produce leukotrienes (cause of late
reaction).
• Degranulation can be mediated by bound IgE-allergen cross-linking
on the surface or direct IgE-independent mast-cell degranulation
(anaphylactoid reaction) responses. Mechanism is calcium-dependent.
• Reaction is an example of type I hypersensitivity, dependent on
the presence of speciﬁc IgE. Other reactions may mimic the clinical
symptoms but without the involvement of IgE (see ‘Anaphylactoid
reactions’, p.125).
• Repeated challenge at short intervals may lead to progressively more
severe reactions, but otherwise the severity of a reaction does not
predict the severity of subsequent reactions.

Presentation
• Usual features are:
• generalized giant urticaria

ANAPHYLAXIS

• angioedema, often involving face, lips, tongue, and larynx, causing
stridor
• bronchospasm
• hypotension with loss of consciousness
• gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps,
diarrhoea).
• Not all symptoms will be present during an attack and only 50% of
patients will have a rash.
• Onset is rapid after exposure, usually within minutes, although some
agents (foods and latex) may lead to a slower onset. Agents that are
injected (drugs, venoms) give the fastest reactions.

Substances causing anaphylaxis
Any substance may cause anaphylaxis, but the most common causes are
as follows.
• Venoms: bee and wasp venoms.
• Legumes: peanuts (and related legumes, soya, and other beans/peas).
• True nuts (walnut, almond, cashew, hazelnut, etc.).
• Shellﬁsh (crustacea, prawns, shrimps, crab, lobster) and ﬁsh.
• Latex (and related foods: banana, avocado, kiwi, chestnut, potato,
tomato).
• Egg, milk.
• Antibiotics: penicillin, cephalosporins, other antibiotics.
• Anaesthetic drugs: neuromuscular blocking agents (e.g.
suxamethonium, vercuronium).
• Peptide hormones (ACTH, insulin).
• Heterologous antisera (antivenins, antilymphocyte globulins,
monoclonal antibodies).
In some cases a cofactor is required for the reaction, such as exercise
or concomitant aspirin ingestion with the food. It is probable that these
cofactors alter the amount of allergen entering the circulation.

Immunological features
• Involvement of IgE requires prior exposure to sensitize the patient. In
childhood, sensitization to peanut may occur via formula milk which
may contain peanut oil. Following sensitization, only tiny amounts may
be required to trigger subsequent reactions.
• Reaction is triggered by cross-linking of mast-cell cytophilic IgE by the
allergen, leading to degranulation and activation of the mast cell.
• Symptoms occur as a result of mast-cell release of histamine, which is
responsible for bronchoconstriction, increased airway mucus secretion,
stimulation of gut smooth muscle, hypotension due to increased
vascular permeability, and vasodilatation and urticaria/angioedema.
• Other mediators include mast-cell tryptase and chemotactic factors
for eosinophils. Activated mast cells also synthesize prostaglandins and
leukotrienes, which reinforce the effects on smooth muscle. Tosyl-Larginine methyl ester (TAME) has a similar effect. Platelet-activating
factor (PAF) causes the activation of platelets, leading to the release of
histamine and serotonin and augmenting the effects on vascular tone
and permeability.

121

122

CHAPTER 3

Allergic disease

• Mast-cell numbers at sites of allergen exposure are critical. It is
speculative that there are variations in the output of mast cells from
bone marrow that inﬂuence the possibility of developing reactions.
• Complement and kinin systems are activated (basophils release
kallikrein when activated). Bradykinin, C3a, and C5a all act as smooth
muscle constrictors and increase vascular permeability.
• Reactions may recur after 2-6 hours, despite successful initial
treatment, because of the continuing synthetic activity of mast cells
and the release of leukotrienes.
• Those with underlying atopic disease are said to be more at risk of
developing serious allergic responses.

Immunological diagnosis (see Box 3.1)
• History is all-important, particularly the timing of reaction in relation
to the suspected trigger. If the trigger is not clear, a detailed review of
all exposures over the preceding 24 hours is required.
• Reaction should be graded.
• Mild: a feeling of generalized warmth, with sensation of fullness in
throat, some localized angioedema and urticaria, but no signiﬁcant
impairment of breathing or features of hypotension.
• Moderate: as for mild, but with more widespread angioedema and
urticaria, some bronchospasm, and mild gastrointestinal symptoms.
• Severe: intense bronchospasm, laryngeal oedema, with severe
shortness of breath, cyanosis, respiratory arrest, hypotension,
cardiac arrhythmias, shock, and gross gastrointestinal symptoms.
• Attention must be paid to other conditions which may appear similar
clinically:
• pulmonary embolus
• myocardial infarction (but this may follow anaphylaxis in those with
pre-existing ischaemic heart disease)
• hyperventilation
• hypoglycaemia
• vasovagal reactions
• phaeochromocytoma
• carcinoid
• systemic mastocytosis
• rarely, the symptoms may be factitious (typically occur in those
who also have true anaphylaxis).
• Conﬁrmation of the nature of the reaction may be obtained by taking
blood for mast-cell tryptase (levels will be elevated for up to 12 hours
and are stable). This is valuable where there is doubt about the nature
of the reaction; urinary methyl histamine is an alternative, but is not
now routinely available.
• Evidence should also be sought for activation of the complement
system (measurement of C3, C4, and C3 breakdown products).
Measurement of C3a and C5a is possible but requires a special tube,
which is unlikely to be available in time.
• Total IgE measurements are of no value.
• Tests for speciﬁc IgE (RAST, etc.) may give false-negative results in
the immediate phase, even when it is quite clear what has caused

MANAGEMENT OF ANAPHYLAXIS

the reaction, because of consumption of the IgE. Repeating tests 3-4
weeks later may be helpful.
• Skin-prick tests (SPTs) may be sufﬁcient to trigger a further systemic
reaction and should be undertaken with great caution and only in a
situation in which full facilities for cardiopulmonary resuscitation are
immediately available.

Management of anaphylaxis
• 0 Immediate management comprises adrenaline (epinephrine) given
intramuscularly in a dose of 0.5-1mg (0.5-1mL of 1:1000) for an adult.
The dose can be repeated if required.
• If the reaction is severe, adrenaline may be given intravenously, using
10mL or 1:10 000 adrenaline diluted in 100mL N-saline, via an infusion
pump. This should only be given with continued cardiac monitoring by
an experienced ITU specialist.
0 Never give IV bolus adrenaline to a conscious patient with anaphylaxis
under any circumstances.
• Give high-ﬂow oxygen by mask.
• Antihistamine should be given intravenously (chlorphenamine 10mg).
• A bolus of hydrocortisone (100-200mg) should be given. This has
no effect on the immediate reaction but reduces the possibility of
a late reaction. Use hydrocortisone sodium succinate; do not use
hydrocortisone phosphate as this is frequently associated with severe
burning genital pain which makes a sick patient feel much worse.
• Cochrane Reviews of antihistamines and steroids in the treatment
of anaphylaxis conclude that evidence is lacking for both, but
custom and practice recommend continued use.
• Support blood pressure with IV ﬂuids (colloid or crystalloid): persisting
hypotension may require further vasopressor agents.
• Tracheotomy may be required if there is major laryngeal oedema.
• Admission for observation is required (risk of late reactions); a period
of 8 hours is usually adequate.
• Great care must be taken with latex-allergic patients, as hospital staff
wearing latex gloves and resuscitation with latex-containing equipment
(masks, catheters, etc.) may make the reaction paradoxically worse
during resuscitation.

123

124

CHAPTER 3

Allergic disease

• Patients who have had severe reactions should be trained to selfadminister adrenaline using a self-injection aid and should carry a
Medic-Alert bracelet or equivalent. See below for indications.
• Regular annual follow-up by a practice nurse should be undertaken to
ensure that patients remain competent in using the adrenaline injector.
• Carrying a supply of antihistamines may also be helpful (used
prophylactically if entering a situation of unknown risk, e.g. eating out).
• 0Patients deemed to be at risk of further anaphylaxis should
preferably not receive treatment with B-blockers, as these agents will
interfere with the action of adrenaline if required.
• 0For venom-allergic patients with ischaemic heart disease, there
may be advantages of continuing with B-blockers
• 0Angiotensin-converting (ACE) inhibitors should be avoided,
as bradykinin-mediated effects will be worse during reactions
(increased severity).
• Patients should receive detailed counselling on how to avoid the
triggering allergen; if a food is involved this should be undertaken by a
dietician experienced in dealing with food allergy. Many foods may be
‘hidden’, so that the consumer is unaware of the contents. This applies
particularly to pre-prepared foods and restaurant meals.
• For bee/wasp anaphylaxis, patients should be warned to avoid
wearing brightly coloured clothes and perfumes as these attract the
insects. They should also stay away from fallen fruit and dustbins.
Desensitization is possible (see Chapter 16). This is a process that
requires considerable dedication on the part of the patient (and
the hospital staff!). It should be reserved for those who have had a
systemic reaction and where the risk of further stings is considered to
be high.
• Latex-allergic patients need to be warned about possible reactions to
foods (banana, avocado, kiwi fruit, chestnut, potato, and tomato) and
be given advice on avoidance. It is important that they tell doctors and
dentists as reactions may be triggered during operations by surgical
gloves or anaesthetic equipment, and by investigations such as barium
enema (rubber cuff on tubing) and dental treatment.

Indications for prescription of adrenaline for self-injection
(EpiPen®, Anapen®, Jext®)
• Adrenaline for self injection should be given when:
• the patient has had a severe allergic reaction
• there is a risk of re-exposure or the allergen cannot easily be
avoided
• the patient has had a moderate reaction, but access to rapid
medical assistance is impossible
• the patient has asthma—reactions are likely to be more severe
• pregnancy is not a contraindication, as the risk to the fetus from
hypoxia due to anaphylaxis is greater than the risk of adrenaline.
• Adrenaline should not be given when:
• the reaction is mild (urticaria or urticaria with minimal angioedema
not involving throat)
• the allergen is avoidable

‘ANAPHYLACTOID’ REACTIONS

• the patient is unable to use an injection device
• the patient has or is at risk of ischaemic heart disease; this may
include the elderly
• the patient is on B-blockers—this is a relative contraindication and
there is some evidence that the effect is not signiﬁcant: however, it
is recommended that the dose of adrenaline be halved in patients
on B-blockers to avoid paradoxical hypertension due to unopposed
A-adrenergic activity
• the patients is on tricyclic antidepressants or abuses cocaine
(increased risk of cardiac arrhythmias).

Problems with adrenaline self-injection devices
• Confusingly, Anapen® and EpiPen® are ﬁred differently; because of this,
they should not be interchanged.
• EpiPen® is triggered by pressure on the needle-containing black tip,
once the safety cap has been removed from the other end. The white
plastic under the safety cap looks like a button but isn’t!
• Anapen® is ﬁred by pressing the button under the safety cap.
• Jext® is similar in operation to EpiPen®.
• Anapen® is available in a 0.5 mg strength.
• Accidental injection into ﬁngers occurs. There is a risk of ischaemia
and patients should be advised to go to casualty (an intravenous
α-blocker may be required).

‘Anaphylactoid’ reactions
These may be every bit as severe as IgE-mediated reactions. In most cases
they are due to activation of mast cells directly or via other mechanisms
that will indirectly activate mast cells.

Causes
The most common causes are as follows.
• Direct mast-cell stimulation: drugs (opiates, thiamine, vancomycin,
radiocontrast media, some anaesthetic agents, especially those
dissolved in cremophor, tubocurarine), foods (strawberries), physical
stimuli (exercise, cold, trauma), venoms.
• Immune complex reactions (types II and III), with release of
anaphylotoxins C3a, C5a: reactions to IVIg, other blood products,
heterologous antisera.
• Cyclo-oxygenase inhibitors: non-steroidal anti-inﬂammatory drugs
(NSAIDs) (may also stimulate mast cells directly).
• Massive histamine ingestion: eating mackerel and other related oily
ﬁsh that are ‘off’ (scombroid poisoning due to breakdown of muscle
histidine to histamine via bacterial spoilage).

Immunological diagnosis
• History usually gives the clue. No tests are entirely speciﬁc. Challenge
is very risky.
• Tryptase will be elevated.
• Speciﬁc IgE will not be detectable.

125

126

CHAPTER 3

Allergic disease

Management
• Acute management is the same as for anaphylaxis.
• For patients who require IV radiocontrast media and are known or
suspected to react, pretreatment with oral corticosteroids (40mg
prednisolone, 13 hours, 7 hours, and 1 hour prior to examination),
together with an antihistamine (cetirizine 10-20mg or fexofenadine
120-180mg orally 1 hour before) and an H2-blocker (cimetidine 400mg
orally 1 hour before) should be used. Low-osmolality dyes should be
used as these have a lower incidence of reactions.

Angioedema
Angioedema is a deep-tissue swelling that must be distinguished from
urticaria. It is rarely itchy, and tends to give discomfort from pressure. In
hereditary angioedema and sometimes in idiopathic angioedema, there is
often a premonitory tingling before the swelling occurs. Any part of the
body (including gut) may be involved.

Causes
• Allergic (accompanied by other features such as urticaria, anaphylaxis,
etc.).
• Hereditary C1-esterase inhibitor or C4BP deﬁciency (see Chapter 1).
• ACE deﬁciency.
• Acquired C1-esterase inhibitor deﬁciency (autoantibody-mediated,
SLE, lymphoma). Lymphoma-associated acquired C1-esterase inhibitor
deﬁciency is usually due to splenic villous lymphomas.
• Physical (pressure, vibration, water—often with urticaria).
• Drugs (ACE inhibitors, NSAIDs, statins, proton-pump inhibitors are
the most common drugs).
• Idiopathic (rarely involves larynx)—other causes excluded.

Immunological features
• Mechanism is thought to involve activation of the kinin system with
bradykinin production, leading to tissue oedema.
• ACE inhibitors inhibit bradykinin breakdown (also cause cough due to
excess bradykinin).
• Histamine is not involved (unless there is accompanying urticaria).
• C1-esterase inhibitor is a control protein for the kinin cascade in
addition to its role in the complement and clotting systems.
• There are polymorphisms of this enzyme but it is not known whether
they correlate with the tendency to develop angioedema.
• Congenital ACE deﬁciency has also been associated with
angioedema.

Diagnosis (see Box 3.2)
• History will give useful clues: family history, connective tissue disease,
lymphoma (may be occult), drug exposure, association with physical
stimuli.
• Differential is wide (see Table 3.1).
• Angioedema with urticaria will not be due to hereditary angioedema.

ANGIOEDEMA

• In angioedema without urticaria, C1-esterase inhibitor deﬁciency
should be excluded.
• C4 will be low, even between attacks;
• C1-inhibitor will be low in type I but high in type II (Chapter 1).
• Levels of C2 are said to distinguish acquired from inherited
C1-esterase inhibitor deﬁciency (low in inherited deﬁciency) but
this test is not reliable.
• If acquired C1 esterase inhibitor deﬁciency is suspected, check:
• for lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly clinically
• serum immunoglobulins
• serum and urine electrophoresis;
• serum free light chains
• Consider chest/abdominal CT scan.
• Check ACE level to exclude ACE deﬁciency.
• Connective tissue disease will usually be obvious, but detection of
autoantibodies (antinuclear antibody (ANA), dsDNA, and extractable
nuclear antigen (ENA) antibodies) may be necessary.

Acute treatment
• Treatment is dependent on the cause.
• The management of C1-esterase inhibitor deﬁciency (HAE) is
discussed in Chapter 1.
• Acquired C1-esterase inhibitor deﬁciency (AAE) due to lymphoma will
be improved by effective treatment of the underlying disease, as will
the autoimmune-associated angioedema.
• Puriﬁed C1-esterase inhibitor may be required in acquired
C1-esterase inhibitor deﬁciency;
• Frequent doses may be required because of the presence
of inhibitory antibodies: in severe cases, plasmapheresis and
immunosuppression may be required;
• FFP is less effective and may actually make the angioedema worse
by providing extra substrate.
• There is no role for C1-esterase inhibitor concentrate in idiopathic
angioedema without evidence of deﬁciency.
• Icatibant (bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist) may have a role in the
management of severe recurrent angioedema (no clinical trial data); it
can be self-administered by subcutaneous injection.

• In acute HAE and AAE attacks, adrenaline, antihistamines, and steroids
are less effective than in anaphylaxis. Laryngeal involvement is less
common in the non-hereditary forms.
• For other types of recurrent angioedema without systemic features,
prednisolone 20mg plus cetirizine 20mg (chewed—tastes horrible!) is
appropriate immediate treatment. Prolonged courses of steroid are
unhelpful.

Prophylactic treatment
• Control may be helped with antiﬁbrinolytics (tranexamic acid, 2-4g/
day), or modiﬁed androgens (stanozolol 2.5-10mg/day; danazol
200-800mg/day):
• monitor LFTs every 4-6 months
• regular ultrasound liver (every 1-3 years).
• Idiopathic form (other causes excluded) responds best to tranexamic
acid and less well to modiﬁed androgens.
• Management of allergic angioedema requires avoidance of triggers and
prophylaxis with long-acting non-sedating antihistamines.
0 Patients with a history of angioedema for any reason should never be
given ACE inhibitors, as these drugs may precipitate life-threatening
events.

URTICARIA 1

Episodic angioedema with eosinophilia
• Angioedema associated with cyclic weight gain (up to 15%), fever,
urticaria, and eosinophilia.
• Cause unknown.
• Said to be benign.

Urticaria 1
Urticaria is common, affecting 10-20% of individuals at some time. Urticaria
depends on mast cells and histamine is the principal mediator. The reaction may be due to IgE on mast cells or stimuli that directly activate mast
cells (see ‘Anaphylactoid reactions’, p.125). Urticaria may occur alone
or be accompanied by more systemic symptoms, including angioedema,
although (as noted above) histamine is not involved in the latter.

Causes
• Urticaria may be acute or chronic (duration more than 1 month).
Chronic urticaria is often idiopathic (75% of cases) and rarely
associated with allergy. 5% of the population may develop a physical
urticaria. Idiopathic urticaria may disappear spontaneously after 1-2
years.
• Most common causes are as follows.
• Stress.
• Infections: in association with common viral infections (concomitant
drug therapy usually gets the blame!); Helicobacter; prodrome of
hepatitis B, Lyme disease, cat-scratch disease; acute or chronic
bacterial infections; parasitic infections.
• Allergic: ingested allergens, injected allergens (e.g. cat scratch).
• Autoimmune: autoantibodies to IgE and to Fc RI (probably rare);
also in association with connective-tissue diseases (antibodies to
C1q): SLE.
• Physical: sunlight (also think of porphyria), vibration, pressure
(immediate and delayed, dermographism), aquagenic, heat.
• Cold: familial (autosomal dominant—C1AS1 gene mutations (see
Chapter 13)); acquired (cryoglobulins, cryoﬁbrinogen, mycoplasma
infections).
• Cholinergic (much smaller wheals, often triggered by heat and
sweating).
• Adrenergic: provoked by stress.
• Contact (e.g. urticaria from lying on grass, wearing latex gloves,
occasionally from aero-allergens).
• Urticaria pigmentosa: rare disease with reddish-brown macules in
skin (accumulations of mast cells).
• Vasculitis: usually a leucocytoclastic vasculitis, painful not itchy; also
serum sickness (immune complex). See also ‘Urticarial vasculitis’,
p.325.
• Hormonal: autoimmune progesterone-induced urticaria related to
menstrual cycle; occasionally other steroids may cause the same
reaction; hypothyroidism.

129

130

CHAPTER 3

Allergic disease

• Papular urticaria: related to insect bites (may last several days).
• Rare syndromes: Muckle-Wells and related syndromes (see
Chapter 14); mastocytosis (see p.132); PUPP (pruritic urticaria and
plaques of pregnancy).
• Urticaria may occur with iron, B12, and folate deﬁciency.

Immunological features
• Mast-cell activation is the cause, with local release of mediators and
activation of other pathways, complement, and kinin.
• Autoantibodies against IgE and the IgE receptor (FcεRI) have been
proposed as a mechanism in some patients with chronic urticaria.
These lead to activation of mast cells by cross-linking surface IgE or
receptors. How generally applicable this mechanism is remains to be
determined. Assays are dubious.
• Mast cells can be stimulated through other pathways, either directly
by drugs etc. (see ‘Anaphylactoid reactions’, p.125) or by the
anaphylotoxins C3a, C5a (type II) and by immune complexes (type III).
In cholinergic urticaria mast cells are unusually sensitive to stimulation
by acetylcholine released by local cholinergic nerves.

Diagnosis
• The history is everything! The appearances of the lesions may give
clues (distinctive lesions in cholinergic urticaria).
• Dermographism should be sought.
• Physical causes can usually be replicated in the clinic to conﬁrm the
diagnosis: pressure tests; ice cube test (wrap ice cube in plastic bag to
ensure that it is cold and not water that causes the problem).
• Other diagnostic tests (see Box 3.3) should depend on likely cause.
• Allergy testing is rarely justiﬁed in chronic urticaria as the yield is
low.
• Check thyroid function, acute-phase response, and full blood count,
and think of infective causes.
• Foods may play a role in acute urticarias; exclusion diets may help
but only if there is a strong suspicion on clinical grounds. The role of
natural dietary salicylates and/or preservatives in chronic urticaria is
controversial.
• In cold urticaria, seek family history and check for cryoglobulins
and causes thereof (electrophoresis of serum, search for underlying
diseases, infections, connective tissue disease, lymphoproliferation).
• Autoantibodies (ANA, ENA, dsDNA, RhF) and complement studies
(C3, C4) may be relevant in some instances. In SLE with urticaria, think
of autoantibodies to C1q.
• Skin biopsy should be considered if there are atypical features if
urticarial vasculitis is suspected.

Urticaria 2: treatment
Treatment
• Urticaria may be difﬁcult to manage, especially cold urticaria. Most
common failing is inadequate dosage of antihistamines. The new
antihistamines are safe in doses well above the recommended
doses and do not interfere with cardiac potassium channels, causing
prolonged QT interval.
• Acute urticaria should be treated with potent non-sedating
antihistamines. Short-acting antihistamines such as acrivastine may be
appropriate for intermittent attacks. Potent long-acting non-sedating
antihistamines, such as fexofenadine, levocetirizine, and cetirizine
(also said to have mast-cell stabilizing activity, of uncertain clinical
signiﬁcance), are useful for prophylaxis against frequent attacks. A few
patients may still be sedated by these drugs.
• Loratadine and desloratadine have been reported by the EMA to be
possibly associated with a small increase in minor malformations if
taken in pregnancy.
• Doses up to four times the normal dose may be required in difﬁcult
cases.
• If antihistamines are unsuccessful alone, the addition of an H2-blocker
may be helpful, although the evidence is weak. There is no evidence to
suggest whether ranitidine or cimetidine is preferable.
• Other therapeutic options include the following.
• Doxepin, an antidepressant with potent H1- and H2-blocking
activity.
• Ketotifen, which has mast-cell stabilizing activity in addition to
anti-H1 activity (it increases appetite and is sedating).
• Mirtazapine is also a valuable third-line agent and has antihistaminic
properties.
• Calcium-channel blockers may have some beneﬁcial effect as they
stabilize mast cells (nimodipine is said to be better than nifedipine).
• B2-agonists (terbutaline) and phosphodiesterase inhibitors
(theophylline) may help in rare cases.

•

Allergic disease

• Pentoxifylline has been reported to reduce cytokine synthesis by
macrophages and may be helpful.
• Colchicine is helpful in delayed pressure urticaria but is poorly
tolerated.
• Leukotriene antagonists may also be helpful in some patients.
• Resistant urticaria may respond to low-dose warfarin (mechanism
unknown).
• Modiﬁed androgens (stanozolol, danazol)—require monitoring of
LFTs.
• Methotrexate—reduces neutrophil accumulation and decreases
leukotriene sysnthesis.
Non-familial cold urticaria may respond to cyproheptadine, calciumchannel blockers, B2-agonists, and phosphodiesterase inhibitors,
although responses tend to be poor.
Familial cold urticaria does not respond to antihistamines, but may
respond to NSAIDs.
Steroids may be effective but should be used as a last resort as chronic
therapy is not justiﬁed by the side effects. Short courses may be
helpful for acute disease. Withdrawal of steroid is often marked by
worse ﬂares of rash.
Ciclosporin or tacrolimus may also be helpful, but the disease
relapses once the drug is withdrawn. The side effects (hypertension,
nephrotoxicity) make them undesirable drugs for urticaria, unless
symptoms are severe. Mycophenolate has also been used.
High-dose IVIg has been used in resistant cases but the beneﬁts are
variable.
Omalizumab may be tried.
Whenever chronic therapy is started, it is important to withdraw it
at intervals to see whether it is still required in the light of possible
spontaneous remission.
Consider stress management programme.

Urticarial vasculitis
• Urticarial vasculitis is distinguished from ordinary urticaria by the
persistence of the lesions for >24 hours. Lesions usually fade to leave
brown staining due to erythrocyte extravasation.
• Biopsies show evidence of cutaneous vasculitis.
• Antihistamines are ineffective.
• The condition is discussed in more detail in Chapter 13.

Mastocytosis
Mastocytosis includes a range of related disorders characterized by excessive accumulations of mast cells in tissues.

Classiﬁcation
• Cutaneous mastocytosis:

MASTOCYTOSIS

•
•

•
•

• urticaria pigmentosa
• solitary mastocytoma
• diffuse cutaneous mastocytosis (rare)
• telangiectasia macularis eruptive perstans.
Systemic mastocytosis:
• involvement of gut, bone marrow, bone.
Mastocytosis in association with haematological disorders:
• leukaemia
• lymphoma
• myelodysplastic syndrome.
Lymphadenopathic mastocytosis with eosinophilia.
Mast-cell leukaemia (very rare!).

Presentation
• Cutaneous involvement with itchy brown macules; Darier’s sign—
urticaria on rubbing or scratching cutaneous lesions. Dermographism.
• Systemic symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, headache,
shortness of breath, ﬂushing, palpitations, loss of consciousness,
malaise, and lethargy.
• Systemic attacks triggered by heat, emotion, aspirin, opiates.
• Evidence of associated haematological malignancy.
• Symptoms may be confused with carcinoid and phaeochromocytoma.

Diagnosis
• Biopsy of skin, bowel; bone marrow examination if systemic form
expected; endoscopy will be required for gut involvement.
• Mast-cell tryptase (serial measurements may be required); urinary
methylhistamine is helpful, but not readily available.
• Exclude carcinoid by measurement of 5-HIAA, phaeochromocytoma
by urinary catecholamines/serum metanephrines.
• Serum immunoglobulins and electrophoresis; urine electrophoreses.
• Blood ﬁlm.
• Bone scan/MRI skeletal survey for inﬁltrations.

Treatment
• High-dose antihistamines (H1 and H2).
• Aspirin may reduce prostaglandin production causing ﬂushing, but
should be used with caution as it can directly activate mast cells;
leukotriene antagonists (monteleukast) will prevent leukotrienerelated symptoms.
• Oral sodium cromoglicate may help bowel symptoms.
• Caution with drug use: avoid opiates and other drugs directly activating
mast cells (radiocontrast dyes, dextrans); anaesthesia needs to be
approached carefully.
• Wasp/bee stings may lead to severe reactions.
• A-Interferon (disappointing in most cases) and c-kit inhibitors (mast
cells express increased c-kit) are being used experimentally. PUVA may
help in skin lesions.

133

134

CHAPTER 3

Allergic disease

Histamine intolerance
• Histamine intolerance may be caused by impairment of the activity of
the enzyme diamine oxidase (DAO), responsible for the metabolism
of histamine. Reduced activity may be due to genetic defects.
• Low DAO activity may predispose to severe reactions and recurrent
anaphylaxis.
• Reduced DAO may be seen in association with drugs (see Box 3.4),
with chronic renal and liver failure, and in chronic urticaria.
• A trial of a low-histamine diet may be beneﬁcial.
• Supplementation with vitamins C and B6 is said to help by increasing
DAO activity.

Asthma 1
Asthma is one of the atopic diseases and is characterized by bronchospasm. It is also a chronic inﬂammatory disease. However, the cause is
multifactorial, with a complex interaction of genetic background with
environmental factors. There is also a complex interaction at the local
level between changes in the airway (reactive airways disease), neurogenic
components (particularly involving vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP)
and substance P), and the innate and speciﬁc immune system.

Causes
Many factors, including occupational exposures, combine to give the clinical pattern of asthma.
• Genetic background There is no doubt that there is a familial
tendency, with inheritance more obvious through the maternal line.
The loci involved are controversial, with loci on chromosome 5
(mapping to the region containing the genes for IL-4, IL-5, and the
B-adrenoreceptor) and on chromosome 11 being proposed.
• Allergy Inhaled allergens (aero-allergens), such as pollens, danders,
dust mites, etc., are potent triggers: IgE will be involved. Allergy is less
commonly demonstrated in late-onset asthma. Occupational allergens
may cause symptoms, with small reactive molecules such as platinum

ASTHMA 1

salts acting by reaction with self-proteins to produce neo-antigens. IgE
may be difﬁcult to demonstrate.
Th1:Th2 balance An intrinsic bias towards Th2-mediated reactions will
lead to higher IgE production and levels of Th2 cytokines (IL-4, IL-5)
which, in turn, downregulate potentially balancing Th1 responses.
Irritants Some agents cause asthma without the involvement of IgE, e.g.
sulphites (see ‘Sulphite sensitivity’, p.137); in part, the effects here may
be due to non-speciﬁc inﬂammation with recruitment of eosinophils
and an IgE-independent cycle of cytokine and mediator release.
Smoking and viral infections may contribute through this mechanism
and through direct epithelial damage. Cold air and exercise may also
be non-speciﬁc triggers to the hyper-reactive airway.
Smooth muscle abnormalities Abnormally low numbers of
B-adrenoreceptors have been documented in asthma. This may
contribute to the reactivity of airways.
Neurogenic Local axon loops involving C-type ﬁbres releasing
substance P and neurokinin A contribute to smooth muscle
constriction. VIPergic neurons antagonize this response, and these
neurons may be reduced in asthma.
Chronic inﬂammatory response Unchecked acute inﬂammation in
the lung proceeds via cytokine release to chronic inﬂammation, with
damage to bronchial epithelium and increased collagen deposition,
leading to endstage irreversible airways disease.

Immunological features
• Activation of mast cells leads to immediate and delayed mediator
release and synthesis of cytokines (IL-3, IL-4, IL-5: chemotactic for and
stimulatory to eosinophils).
• Lung eosinophilia may be marked, continuing the inﬂammatory process
through the release of cytokines.
• Lymphocytes are recruited and activated, releasing Th2 cytokines and
stimulating further IgE production.
• The chronic phase may be considered to include a type IV reaction.

Diagnosis
• The diagnosis depends on history and examination. There is frequently
an atopic background and a family history of atopic diseases. Wheeze
is less common in children, who tend to cough instead.
• Serial peak ﬂow measurements may show the typical asthmatic
pattern. Chronic disease may show loss of reversibility and be
difﬁcult to distinguish from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
(COPD). Reactive airways may be demonstrated with challenge tests
(methacholine—see Part 2).
• A high total IgE makes asthma more likely but does not correlate well
with symptoms. A low IgE only excludes IgE-mediated bronchospasm.
SPTs to common aero-allergens may pick up positives, but the history
will indicate whether these are relevant clinically.
• There may be an eosinophilia on full blood count, although this is
rarely marked and is only present in about 50% of asthmatics; sputum
eosinophilia is much more common.

135

136

CHAPTER 3

Allergic disease

• Other serum markers have been proposed for assessing the severity
of disease and adequacy of therapy. These include soluble CD23 (a
cytokine involved in IgE production) and eosinophil cationic protein
(ECP), which is said to correlate well with the underlying chronic
eosinophilic inﬂammation. These tests are expensive and their role in
monitoring remains to be determined.

Asthma 2: treatment
• The mainstay of treatment remains inhaled short- and long-acting
bronchodilators (B2-agonists, anticholinergics) together with inhaled
corticosteroids.
• The current view of the inﬂammatory nature of asthma makes the
use of inhaled steroids more important in preventing long-term lung
damage. B2-agonists relieve symptoms but have little/no effect on
the underlying inﬂammation. Long-acting drugs, such as salmeterol,
may lead to a false sense of security as symptoms are suppressed,
and should be used with care. They may have some intrinsic antiinﬂammatory effect.
• Leukotriene antagonists (monteleukast) are valuable.
• Courses of oral corticosteroids may be required.
• Sodium cromoglicate inhibits degranulation of connective tissue mast
cells only and inhibits the activation of neutrophils, eosinophils, and
monocytes. It is most effective in children and in exercise-induced
asthma. Nedocromil sodium is similar but inhibits both mucosal
and connective-tissue mast cells and is a more potent inhibitor of
neutrophils and eosinophils.
• Phosphodiesterase inhibitors (theophyllines) are decreasing in
popularity. Intravenous aminophylline is no longer recommended for
acute attacks; intravenous magnesium has superseded it.
• Experimental immunosuppressive therapy with low-dose methotrexate
or ciclosporin has been used with success in severe disease.
• Omalizumab, a monoclonal anti-IgE, has been shown to be highly
beneﬁcial. Is use is limited by the degree of elevation of total IgE, and
(in the UK) by ﬁnancial restraints.
• Antihistamines have little effect in acute asthma.
• Injection immunotherapy has been used where there is allergy to a
single agent. This can be extremely dangerous, and current guidelines
exclude asthmatics from consideration of desensitization. Sublingual
immunotherapy may be safer in asthmatics.
• Other forms of immunotherapy, aimed at switching immune responses
from Th2 to Th1 using peptides or genetically engineered BCG, have
shown considerable promise.
• Environmental control is important both in the home and in the
context of occupational asthma.
• Attempts should be made to reduce house dust-mite exposure by
reducing ambient temperature and avoiding high humidity (fewer
house plants).

SULPHITE SENSITIVITY

• Avoid thick-pile carpets, heavy curtains, and other dust traps.
• Regular vacuuming with a high-efﬁciency vacuum cleaner (cyclonic
or HEPA ﬁlter) is necessary (cleaners that do not spray dust back
into the room may be better, although much more expensive).
• Mattress covers are desirable and all bedclothes should be
washable (at high temperatures).
• De-miting mattresses is difﬁcult: liquid nitrogen is effective but
needs specialist services. Acaricides such as benzyl benzoate may
also be effective, but may be irritants.
• If animal danders are a problem, the animal should go, although this
news is rarely popular with patients! This is controversial as there
is evidence that early exposure of children to pets in atopic families
may reduce the chance of their developing allergies.

Sulphite sensitivity
Some individuals are unusually sensitive to sulphites. These agents include
sulphur dioxide, sodium and potassium metabisulphite, and sulphite. They
are widely used in foods and drinks as antioxidants and preservatives.

Presentation
• Reactions include severe wheeze accompanied by ﬂushing and
tachycardia; if severe, may mimic anaphylaxis.
• Urticaria and angioedema are not usually features.

Cause
• Mechanism is unclear but probably involves direct mast-cell stimulation
and cholinergic stimulation.
• IgE antibodies have occasionally been detected.
• There does not appear to be any cross-reactivity with other agents.

Diagnosis
• The history is usually diagnostic, with reactions typically to white wine
or beer, soft drinks, pickles, salami and preserved meats, dried fruits,
shrimps/prawns, and prepared salads.
• Certain drugs for injection contain sulphites, particularly adrenalinecontaining local anaesthetics used by dentists.
• No tests are of particular value except for exclusion followed
by re-challenge under controlled conditions (with facilities for
resuscitation).

Treatment
• Management is by avoidance, and proper dietary advice is required.
• Care must be taken with the prescription of drugs.
• Severe reactors may need to carry adrenaline (without sulphites).

137

138

CHAPTER 3

Allergic disease

Aspirin sensitivity
Presentation
• Acute angioedema.
• Aspirin is also associated with a triad of asthma, nasal polyposis, and
hyperplastic sinusitis (Samter’s triad). Each feature can occur without
the others.

Cause
• Effect is due to a sensitivity to cyclo-oxygenase inhibition, and
therefore occurs with other NSAIDs but not usually with choline or
sodium salicylate or paracetamol (acetaminophen).
• Paracetamol has weak COX-1 inhibitory function and may rarely
cause angioedema.
• There is a loss of bronchodilating prostaglandins and a shunting of
substrate to the lipo-oxygenase pathway with the production of
bronchoconstrictor leukotrienes.
• Some patients with aspirin intolerance also react to tartrazine and
related azo-dyes.

Diagnosis
• Speciﬁc IgE tests are of uncertain value. Flow-CAST® assay may show
positives in some patients (see Chapter 19).
• Aspirin challenge is not recommended unless there is doubt about the
diagnosis, as reactions may be severe.

Treatment
• Exclusion of natural salicylate from the diet may be helpful if asthmatic
symptoms and nasal polyps are troublesome.
• Obstructing polyps need to be removed surgically; oral or topical
corticosteroids will lead to shrinkage. Regrowth after surgery can be
prevented by diet and drug therapy with topical nasal steroids and oral
agents.
• Large polyps may need treatment with betnesol drops for short
periods, before nasal steroid sprays will be effective. The combination
of oral antihistamines and monteleukast can be helpful.
• Aspirin desensitization can be undertaken: incremental doses of aspirin
are administered over 2 days; tolerance persists only while aspirin is
administered regularly. Risks of triggering severe acute asthma are high,
and the treatment should be undertaken with ITU back-up.
• Nasal furosemide drops (50mcg per nostril bd) can be very effective
in reducing polyp size. Treatment needs to be continued long term.
Extemporaneous preparation of the drops by pharmacy is
required.

ALLERGIC RHINITIS

Allergic rhinitis
Allergic rhinitis needs to be distinguished from non-allergic causes, such
as vasomotor rhinitis, rhinitis medicamentosa, and infectious cause. This
is not always easy. Timing of symptoms (seasonal versus perennial) will
give useful clues. Perennial rhinitis is often due to dust mite allergy; symptoms often worsen in October when windows are shut and the central
heating switched on, as mite numbers increase with rising humidity and
temperature.

Causes of rhinitis
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Allergic.
Vasomotor.
Non-allergic rhinitis with eosinophilia (NARES).
Drug-induced: A-agonist nasal sprays, cocaine abuse (direct);
antihypertensives, chlormethiazole (indirect).
Irritant: fumes, solvents.
Infectious: viral, bacterial, leprosy, cilial dyskinesia.
Vasculitis: Wegener’s granulomatosis.
Mechanical: nasal polyps, septal deviation, foreign bodies, tumours,
sarcoidosis.
Pregnancy: last trimester (related to oestrogen levels).
CSF leak.

Immunological mechanisms
• Mechanisms in allergic rhinitis are very similar to those described
above for asthma, although histamine release plays a more signiﬁcant
role and the role of neurogenic mechanisms is less well established.
• Histamine and leukotrienes are though to be responsible for the itch,
sneezing, rhinorrhoea, and nasal obstruction, through swelling and
hyperaemia.
• There is a predominant eosinophilia in tissue and secretions.
• Perennial rhinitis may be a manifestation of chronic antigen exposure
and, like chronic asthma, may lead, via type IV mechanisms, to chronic
tissue damage with connective tissue proliferation.
• Allergens involved are similar to those involved in asthma, i.e.
aero-allergens, although larger allergens will tend to be trapped
preferentially in the nose.
• Nasal polyps may occur as a result of chronic allergic stimulation.

Diagnosis
• Diagnosis relies heavily on the history and on examination of the
nose. Rhinoscopy may be necessary to obtain a good view; use of an
otoscope is adequate for most purposes.
• Eosinophil count in blood is rarely elevated.
• Elevated total IgE may indicate an allergic basis, but a normal IgE does
not exclude allergy.
• SPTs demonstrate sensitization to aero-allergens, but the clinical
relevance can be determined only from the history.

139

140

CHAPTER 3

Allergic disease

• Speciﬁc IgE (RASTs) should be limited only to conﬁrming equivocal
SPTs, or when drugs such as antihistamines cannot be discontinued.
Both RASTs and SPTs may be negative even in the presence of
signiﬁcant local allergy if no speciﬁc IgE is free to spill over into the
bloodstream.
• Examination of nasal secretions for excess eosinophils may be helpful,
although there is a condition of non-allergic rhinitis with eosinophilia
(NARES). This is often associated with aspirin sensitivity and asthma;
sinusitis is also common.
• Peripheral blood eosinophilia is variable and is a poor diagnostic
marker.
• If the suspect allergen is available, then nasal provocation tests may be
possible (see Part 2).

Treatment
• Topical or systemic antihistamines provide relief in mild cases.
• More severe cases may require topical steroids or mast-cell blocking
agents such as sodium cromoglicate or nedocromil sodium.
• Ipratropium bromide is particularly helpful in vasomotor rhinitis.
• Ensure that the patient understands the optimum head position for use
of nasal sprays: head forward looking at feet, with nozzle pointed away
from the nasal septum.
• 0 Most therapeutic failures are due to incorrect use of sprays!
• Decongestants should be used with caution (or not at all) because of a
rebound increase in symptoms.
• Very severe cases may require courses of oral corticosteroids. Depot
injections of long-acting steroid have been used in the past in seasonal
rhinitis. These are not recommended (risk of avascular necrosis of
joints).
• If drug therapy fails at maximal levels, immunotherapy may be
appropriate if a single allergen is responsible and there are no
contraindications such as severe asthma, pregnancy, B-blockers, or
ischaemic heart disease. This should only be undertaken in hospital.
Results for seasonal allergens are excellent.
• Surgery may be required for sinus involvement and for polyps if topical
steroid therapy fails to reduce them.
• Environmental control may be important as an adjunctive measure.
Avoidance of allergens where possible should be tried. In the grasspollen season avoid opening windows more than necessary during the
day (especially in the afternoon and evening when the pollen count is
high). Air ﬁltration systems able to trap pollens are available for cars
and houses, although the latter are expensive to install. Masks are
likely to be of little value.
• Cold air, alcohol, and spicy foods may exacerbate symptoms in
vasomotor rhinitis.

SINUSITIS

Allergic conjunctivitis
Allergic conjunctivitis often accompanies rhinitis (the two areas are connected by the lacrimal ducts). The mechanisms are identical.

Presentation
• Typical features include itching and watering of the eye, with redness
and swelling.
• More extreme forms include vernal conjunctivitis, in which giant
papillae are seen on the tarsal surface of the eyelid. In this condition
the allergic component is a trigger. This disease is difﬁcult to treat but
may burn out after 5-10 years.

Diagnosis
• As for rhinitis.
• Speciﬁc IgE may be detected in tears but it is rarely of value as a
diagnostic test.
• Challenge tests may be helpful in very rare circumstances.

Treatment
• Topical antihistamines and mast-cell stabilizing agents (sodium
cromoglicate and nedocromil) may help to relieve symptoms.
Lodoxamide is another mast-cell stabilizer speciﬁcally available for
allergic eye problems.
• Oral antihistamines are valuable for more severe symptoms.
• Topical steroids may be very valuable, but should only be prescribed
under ophthalmological supervision as long-term use may lead to
glaucoma and cataract.
• Short-course oral steroids can be used for severe symptoms
unresponsive to topical treatment and to cover periods of
examinations etc.
• Topical ciclosporin and NSAIDs (ﬂurbiprofen and diclofenac) have also
been used successfully in vernal conjunctivitis.
• Immunotherapy (either injected or sublingual) is often valuable;
however, vernal conjunctivitis responds less well.

Sinusitis
Causes
• Allergy, with secondary infection due to allergic swelling closing off the
drainage ostia. Usually associated with other allergic features.
• Primary infective: due to mechanical drainage problem; secondary to
humoral immune deﬁciency.
• Aspirin intolerance.
• Ethmoiditis in children may mimic conjunctivitis.
• Inﬂammatory disease such as Wegener’s granulomatosis and midline
granuloma.
• Chronic fungal sinusitis is recognized by ENT specialists even in the
absence of immune deﬁciency.

CHAPTER 3

Allergic disease

Presentation
• Usually obvious with pain over sinuses.
• Maxillary sinusitis may also present as dental pain in upper molars.

Diagnosis
• Plain radiographs not recommended; CT scanning is most sensitive.
• Nasal smears will demonstrate eosinophilia if there is an allergic cause,
but neutrophilia will be present in infective cases.
• Measurement of humoral immune function (immunoglobulins, IgG
subclasses, and speciﬁc antibodies) and ANCA should be considered in
chronic sinusitis.

Treatment
• Treat underlying cause.
• Obstructed sinuses can be washed out. This can be done by an
endoscopic procedure that allows the sinuses to be inspected.
• Nasal decongestants and topical steroids assist in reducing oedema
and promoting free drainage.
• Antibiotics are required for infective problems. Haemophilus inﬂuenzae
and Pneumococcus are the most common organisms. Ciproﬂoxacin,
clarithromycin, and azithromycin are appropriate as they penetrate
well into sinus ﬂuids.
• If all else fails, try a prolonged course of an oral antifungal such as
itraconazole.

Secretory otitis media (glue ear)
It has been suggested that this is related to underlying allergy, but there is
little evidence for this in children unless there is allergic disease elsewhere
in the respiratory tract. Rarely, it may be related to speciﬁc antibody deﬁciency or a more widespread antibody deﬁciency. The history will reveal if
there are other infective problems that would suggest such a diagnosis.

Atopic eczema (dermatitis)
Atopic eczema is the most common manifestation of atopic disease. It is
usually worst in childhood, improving with age in 80%. It affects particularly the cheeks and ﬂexures, and is a risk factor for the development of
contact dermatitis in later life. Asthma or rhinitis will develop in 50-75% of
patients. It is on the increase. Eye involvement may occur, with an atopic
keratoconjunctivitis, and in severe cases a subcapsular cataract may form.

Causes
• There is a genetic basis, as demonstrated by twin studies, although
whether the background is the same as for asthma (chromosome 11
or 5) has not yet been demonstrated.
• In addition to the immunological factors, there are abnormalities of the
lipids of the skin and evidence for autonomic nervous abnormalities

ATOPIC ECZEMA (DERMATITIS)

(white dermographism). There is a reduced threshold for itch,
which leads to a vicious cycle of itch and scratch, resulting in the
licheniﬁcation of chronic eczema.
• Non-speciﬁc irritants, such as wool, heat, and stress, make the disease
worse.
• Staphylococcal infection is common, and may play a role in
exacerbating the disease; IgE against the bacterium may be detected,
although the role is unclear. Staphylococcal superantigens have also
been suggested to play a role. Cutaneous fungi may also exacerbate
the disease.
• The role of diet is controversial. It has been suggested that maternal
diet during pregnancy may contribute, as may a lack of breastfeeding.
The contribution of diet to established symptoms is even more
controversial, although some children are helped by exclusion diets. It
is rare that adults are helped by dietary manoeuvres.

Immunological features
• The precise role of type I responses is unclear. IgE levels are often
very high, and speciﬁc IgE may be detected against a variety of aeroallergens and food allergens, although most of the IgE is ‘junk’ with no
recognizable speciﬁcity.
• Langerhans cells in the skin do have IgE receptors, although their role
in atopic eczema is speculative. Keratinocytes release cytokines when
damaged, which will excite the immune response (TNFA, IL-1, IL-6,
IL-8).
• There is more evidence for a type IV reaction with an inﬁltrate of
CD4+ T cells into the epidermis and dermis; most of these cells are of
the Th2 phenotype which will support IgE production. As part of the
inﬂammatory response, eosinophils, mast cells, and basophils are all
increased in the affected skin, and mechanisms similar to those found
in the chronic phase of asthma probably predominate.

Diagnosis
• Blood eosinophilia is common.
• 80% of cases will have a high IgE, often >1000kU/L. Speciﬁc IgE may be
detected by SPTs or RAST, but this rarely helps in management.
• A typical patterns of eczema with other infections should raise
suspicion of the hyper-IgE syndrome. Here the IgE is even higher,
usually >50 000kU/L, and there may be evidence of other humoral
abnormalities such as low IgG2, so a full investigation of humoral
immunity is warranted.
• Viral infections such as eczema herpeticum, molluscum contagiosum,
and warts are common in atopic eczema. They do not indicate a
signiﬁcant generalized immunodeﬁciency but are a manifestation of
disturbed local immunity.

Treatment
• Reduce itch by using emollients and antihistamines, inﬂammation
by using topical steroids, and staphylococcal superinfection by using
appropriate oral antibiotics.

143

144

CHAPTER 3

Allergic disease

• Ciclosporin is helpful in severe disease as a temporary measure, but
the disease relapses as soon as the drug is withdrawn. Topical agents
(tacrolimus and pimecrolimus) may be effective and do not have the
same adverse effects as steroids.
• PUVA.
• High-dose IVIg has also been shown to be beneﬁcial in resistant cases.
• Theoretically, G-interferon should help by reducing the Th2
predominance, and this has been borne out in several small trials.
• Where babies, by virtue of a strong family history, are at risk of
developing atopic eczema, avoidance of cows’ milk for the ﬁrst 6
months of life and late weaning may be helpful. The addition of
G-linoleic acid and ﬁsh oil have been suggested to be helpful, but the
evidence from controlled trials is less supportive.
• Avoidance of egg, milk, or wheat may help some children. If there is
concern over the contribution of food in adults, a 2-week trial of an
elimination diet will identify whether or not food is contributing.

Contact dermatitis (hypersensitivity)
Presentation
• Contact hypersensitivity is a localized type IV reaction due to contact
with a triggering allergen. Reaction is eczematous, often with blistering
and weeping. The pattern of rash together with a careful exposure
history usually identiﬁes possible allergens.
• It needs to be distinguished from straightforward irritant dermatitis
due to a localized toxic effect that does not involve the immune
system. Typical irritants are solvents, acids, alkalis, and other chemicals.
The skin has a limited number of ways in which it can respond, and the
appearance of irritant and allergic dermatitis can be clinically similar.

Causes
• Many topically applied compounds can cause DTH reactions.
• Nickel allergy often leads to dermatitis affecting the ear lobes,
under the back of watches, and where jean studs press on the skin.
Those regularly handling coins will get hand eczema. This is the
most common contact dermatitis.
• Aniline dyes in leather cause dermatitis affecting the feet and where
leather belts come in contact with skin.
• Chromium: hand eczema, usually in those handling cement.
• Cobalt: used as a stabilizer for the head on beer!
• Latex and synthetic rubbers: related to chemical accelerators and
hardeners (thiurams, mercapto compounds, carbamates). There is
no evidence that latex proteins themselves cause type IV reactions.
• Hair dyes, formaldehyde (perming lotions).
• Fragrances and cosmetics (biocides, phenylenediamine, parabens).
• Topical antibiotics (gentamicin, neomycin, bacitracin, benzocaines).
• Colophony (rosin) and other resins (adhesives in plasters).
• Ivy, sumac tree, chrysanthemum, feverfew, primula.

ITCH (PRURITUS)

• Some allergens require concomitant exposure to sunlight for the effect
to develop; rash only develops on sun-exposed areas of contact.
• Plants: limes, lemons, ﬁgs, giant hogweed, pine wood.
• Drugs, including sulphonamides, tetracylines, and phenothiazines,
and sunscreens (p-aminobenzoic acid, oil of bergamot).

Immunology
• Types I and IV hypersensitivity may coexist.
• In most cases the allergens are low molecular weight substances that
penetrate the skin readily and lead to neoantigen formation. As with all
T-lymphocyte-mediated responses, sensitization precedes reactivity.
• Active lesions show a sparse CD4+ T-lymphocytic inﬁltrate but few
eosinophils.

Diagnosis
• The history and examination give the most important information.
• This should be supplemented by patch testing (see Part 2).
• SPTs and measurement of total IgE are of little value.

Treatment
•
•
•
•

This should be undertaken by a dermatologist.
Antihistamines may be needed to control itch.
Wet compresses may be required for weeping eczema.
Potent topical steroids accompanied by avoidance of the offending
agents usually lead to resolution.
• Low-nickel diets may be tried for those with proven type IV sensitivity
to nickel.

Itch (pruritus)
Presentation
• Itch without rash is not due to allergy (and rarely responds to
antihistamines).
• Itch with rash may be allergic (and may respond to antihistamines).
• Always look for other causes.
• Itch may be unbearable.
• Excessive scratching may cause skin damage (nodular prurigo).

Causes
• With rash, consider:
• atopic dermatitis
• urticaria
• lichen simplex
• lichen planus
• psoriasis
• scabies
• xerosis (dry skin).
• Without rash, consider:
• uraemia

CHAPTER 3

Allergic disease

• cholestasis (primary biliary cirrhosis)
• malignancy (lymphoma, including cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, CLL,
myeloma, mastocytosis)
• multiple sclerosis
• thyroid disease
• diabetes (with neuropathy)
• iron deﬁciency anaemia
• HIV
• drugs
• psychological (neurotic excoriation)—not present at sites that
cannot be scrtatched
• brachioradial pruritus (affects forearam; worse in sun, relieved by
ice)—may be a marker of spinal tumour
• notalgia paraesthetica (unilateral, around scapula; may be due to
nerve impingement thoracic spine).

Immunology
• Only in relation to underlying disease—itch is not primarily
immunological when histamine and bradykinin not involved.
• Substance P may be involved.

Diagnosis
• The history and examination give the most important information.

Investigation
• Based on differential diagnosis.

Treatment
• Treat underlying condition.
• Antihistamines, if allergic cause: use sedating antihistamines at night
(hydroxyzine, chlorphenamine) or tricyclic antidepressants (potent
antihistaminic activity: doxepin).
• Topical doxepin cream.
• Topical capsaicin cream (counter-irritant).
• Menthol in aqueous cream is soothing; calamine lotion may also be
helpful.
• Opioid antagonists (naltrexone)—valuable in cholestasis, nodular
prurigo.
• Gabapentin, sodium valproate, carbamazepine.
• Aprepitant (Emend®), a neurokinin-1 antagonist, may be helpful in
refractory itch.

Food allergy 1
Food allergy causes more trouble than any other aspect of immunology.
The general population blames foods for a multitude of sins. However,
the public perception of food allergy is not reﬂected by its true incidence
when large-scale population studies are undertaken. True food additive
intolerance is very rare (<0.23% of the population) when those claiming
to be intolerant are formally tested. Food allergy (in which IgE is involved)

FOOD ALLERGY 1

must be distinguished from food intolerance, which may have a variety of
causes, and from psychogenic causes.
Symptoms of true food allergy are invariably limited to the gut, the
skin, and the respiratory tract. Symptoms outside these systems are much
less likely to be due to true allergy. There is no convincing association
with arthritis. There is no evidence that food allergy is a cause of chronic
fatigue syndrome (CFS) (Chapter 14), and thus ‘desensitization’ therapies
have nothing to offer; equally there is no evidence to support Candida
overgrowth as a cause of CFS.

Causes—true food allergy
• True food allergy is very real and may be severe (see ‘Anaphylaxis’,
pp.120-5). It is most common in children (up to 0.5% may be allergic
to cows’ milk). Almost any food can cause true allergy mediated via
IgE.
• Most allergens involved in food allergy are heat stable (resist cooking)
and acid stable (resist stomach acid). There are exceptions to this, so
that a food will be allergenic cooked but not raw, or vice versa; these
foods are typically fruit and vegetables.
• Cows’ milk allergy is common, especially in children under
5. The proteins responsible for the allergic response include
B-lactoglobulin, A-lactalbumin, casein, bovine serum albumin, and
bovine immunoglobulins. Often the response is against more than one
antigen. This allergy usually disappears by the age of 5 years. Rarely,
gastrointestinal haemorrhage may result (Heiner’s syndrome is this
complex accompanied by iron-deﬁciency anaemia and pulmonary
haemosiderosis).
• Egg, milk, and wheat allergies are common in the under-ﬁves, and
often disappear with age, although anaphylactic responses may occur.
The major antigens are ovomucoid and ovalbumin. Cross-reaction with
chicken meat is unusual.
• Fish allergy may be severe, such that inhalation of allergens in the
vapour from cooking ﬁsh or second-hand contact (e.g. kissing someone
who has eaten ﬁsh) may be enough to trigger reactions. The allergens
are species-speciﬁc in 50% and cross-reactive with all ﬁsh in the
remainder. Fish allergy is usually permanent. Similar constraints apply
to shellﬁsh, both crustacea (prawns, crabs, and lobster) and molluscs
(mussels, scallops, and oysters).
• The legumes (peanuts and soya) are major causes of severe allergic
reactions. These agents cause major problems because they are widely
used as food ‘ﬁllers’ and may not be declared on labels. Avoidance
may be difﬁcult. Sensitization may rarely be extreme, such that trace
amounts of residual protein in peanut (groundnut) oil may be enough
to trigger reactions. Sensitization may occur through the use of
groundnut oil in formula milks. Arachis oil (groundnut oil) is used as
a carrier in certain intramuscular injections. True nuts may be equally
troublesome. These reactions are often lifelong, although a proportion
of children who develop peanut allergy early in life may grow out of it
(oral challenge required).

147

148

CHAPTER 3

Allergic disease

• Cereals may cause direct allergic responses if ingested or cause
symptoms via gluten intolerance (coeliac disease). Flour also causes
baker’s asthma as an occupational disease. Wheat, barley, and rye are
all closely related. Symptoms are less extreme, and this is hypothesized
to be due to proteolysis reducing the allergenicity, although why this
does not apply to other foods is unclear. Rice and maize allergies are
rare.
• Oral allergy syndromes (see p.151 for more detailed discussion),
where there is allergy to pollens and cross-reactive food allergies
(usually non-anaphylactic). Allergens tend to be heat-labile.
• Birch-pollen allergy with allergy to hazelnut, apple, pear, and carrot.
• Birch pollen allergy with stone fruits (plums, peaches, cherries,
almonds).
• Ragweed allergy with melon, banana.
• Grass pollen allergy with tomato, melon.
• Mugwort pollen allergy with celery, carrots, spices (includes
vermouth!).
• Other described associations include latex with banana, avocado, kiwi
fruit, chestnut, lettuce, pineapple, and papaya.
• Occasionally trace contaminants may be responsible for allergy, as
in the case of antibiotics in meat (used by farmers to improve the
animals’ weight gain), which may lead to reactions to meat and to
therapeutic drugs.
• Concomitant administration of proton pump inhibitors and H2-blockers,
which reduce stomach acid may increase allergenicity of foods.

Causes—food intolerance
True food allergy must be distinguished from food intolerance, which
takes many forms.
• Pharmacological: caffeine and theobromine (tachycardias in heavy tea/
coffee drinkers), tyramine (headaches, hypertension in patients on
MAOIs), alcohol (obvious symptoms, plus beer drinkers’ diarrhoea),
NSAIDs (may include natural salicylates), ﬁgs (laxatives).
• Toxic: scombrotoxin (histamine from spoiled mackerel), green
potatoes, ﬂatoxins (peanuts), lectins (PHA in undercooked kidney
beans), food poisoning (Bacillus cereus (fried rice), staphylococcal
toxins), monosodium glutamate (headaches, nausea, and sweating—
Chinese restaurant syndrome).
• Enzyme deﬁciencies: lactase deﬁciency (common in Asians; diarrhoea
due to laxative effect of lactose), also sucrase and maltase deﬁciency.
• Fructose intolerance—excess undigested fructose causes diarrhoea,
abdominal cramp, and bloating; high levels in onions, peppers, and fruit
juices).
• Other bowel disease: Crohn’s disease, coeliac disease, infections
(Giardia, Yersinia), bacterial overgrowth (in association with reduced
motility, e.g. systemic sclerosis), ‘irritable bowel syndrome’ (other
causes must be excluded).
• Pancreatic insufﬁciency: cystic ﬁbrosis, Schwachman’s syndrome (see
Chapter 1).
• Psychogenic: ‘smells’, somatization disorder.

FOOD ALLERGY 2

Food allergy 2: immunological
mechanisms, diagnosis, and treatment
Immunological mechanisms
• For true allergic reactions pre-sensitization is required. The bowel
contains a speciﬁc subset of mast cells (MCT), which are capable of
being armed by IgE. Activated T cells are also present. The pattern
of reactions is probably very similar to that in mechanisms involving
mast cells in other sites, although it is less well studied because of
inaccessibility.
• Abnormalities of mucosal immunity may contribute to the generation
of IgE antibodies to foods. IgA deﬁciency may be a predisposing factor
to allergic disease in general and also to coeliac disease, although cause
and effect has not been proved beyond reasonable doubt. Exposure of
an immature mucosal immune system may also be a factor, hence the
lower rates of food allergy in babies breastfed and weaned late.
• It has been suggested that some of the slower-onset food reactions
may involve type III (immune complex reactions). This is difﬁcult
to prove as IgG anti-food antibodies are not uncommon in healthy
individuals. Recent publications indicating that irritable bowel disease
is associated with IgG anti-food antibodies need to be viewed with
caution.

Diagnosis
• The history may give good clues about particular foods that cause
problems.
• SPTs are helpful for foods causing severe reactions (milk, egg, ﬁsh,
peanuts, true nuts), while being less useful for other food groups.
• If commercial reagents do not work, the fresh food should be tried
(stab lancet into food and then into patient). However, SPT to fresh
foods may be dangerous in those who have had severe anaphylactic
reactions. Dose is unstandardized.
• RAST tests are less sensitive.
• Total IgE is not especially helpful.
• The allergy practitioner will need to have a good understanding of the
biological families in which plants are grouped, as this often helps to
explain patterns of reactivity. Members of the same biological family
often share common antigens.
• Dietary manipulation plays an important role in diagnosis, but is
time-consuming and should only be undertaken in collaboration with
a dietician. Elimination diets (oligo-allergenic diets), with gradual
reintroduction of foods in an open but controlled manner, may be
helpful in identifying troublesome foods. Formal conﬁrmation requires
a double-blind placebo-controlled food challenge in which the suspect
food is disguised in opaque gelatine capsules.
• Differentiation of food intolerance requires careful history-taking.
Patients should be investigated for evidence of malabsorption (iron,
B12, folate, clotting, calcium, and alkaline phosphatase) and for coeliac
disease (endomysial or tissue transglutaminase antibodies); if there is

149

150

CHAPTER 3

Allergic disease

diarrhoea, do stool microscopy and culture. Acute-phase proteins will
indicate likely inﬂammatory bowel disease.
• Bacterial overgrowth, lactose intolerance, and pancreatic insufﬁciency
can be diagnosed on appropriate radio-isotopic tests or by measuring
breath hydrogen production. Faecal elastase is a useful test of
pancreatic exocrine function
• Radiology of the bowel may be revealing, and biopsy should always
be considered; enzyme levels can be measured and coeliac disease
conﬁrmed rapidly. In early coeliac disease, histology may show only a
lymphocytic inﬁltrate without complete villous atrophy.

Treatment
• Distinguish food allergy from intolerance and non-food-related
symptoms.
• Educate the patient about their symptoms and the cause. This may be
hard if the patient already has a well-established preconception that
he/she has a ‘food allergy’.
• Management of food allergy is mainly avoidance, while maintaining a
nutritious diet. Specialist dietetic support is required.
• Antihistamines (H1 and H2) may be of value taken prophylactically
when patients with true food allergy are eating in unfamiliar
surroundings; routine use is unnecessary.
• Patients who have had anaphylaxis need to have adrenaline for selfinjection.
• Oral sodium cromoglicate may help occasional patients.
• A short course of steroids may be necessary for severe disease
(eosinophilic gastropathy, enteritis).
• Enzyme-potentiated desensitization (EPD) is not of proven value,
despite claims to the contrary by some practitioners.
• Management of food intolerance depends on the underlying cause.

Contact allergy to food
• Causes
Contact reactions to food may be due to the following.
• Irritant dermatitis:
• citrus juices
• mustard family
• corn (usually farmers and processing workers)
• pineapple (bromelin)—proteolytic enzyme
• spices
• chilli peppers—capsaicin.
• Allergic contact dermatitis (common in chefs). Includes (nonexhaustive list):
• mango sap (and related foods: cashew)
• mustard family
• olive oil
• citrus fruits
• artichoke

ORAL ALLERGY SYNDROME

•
•
•
•

• asparagus
• celery family (carrots, parsley, parsnip)
• garlic
• spices (especially cinnamon).
Contact urticaria:
• immunological or non-immunlogical.
Phototoxic or photo-allergic dermatitis.
Photoxic reactions mainly due to psoralens (e.g. celery family, citrus
family—mixing or drinking margaritas!).
Photallergic reactions are rare—mainly garlic.

Immunology and diagnosis
• History of exposure and type of rash is crucial.
• Patch testing may be useful.
• Photopatch testing may be required.

Oral allergy syndrome
• Oral allergy syndrome (OAS) is caused by IgE to heat-labile allergens
in fruits. These are highly cross-reactive. Symptoms are usually mild
and restricted to oropharynx (itching and local swelling).

Immunology and diagnosis
• Standard commercial SPT solutions and in vitro speciﬁc IgE tests do not
reliably identify the allergy, as the antigens are labile.
• The use of recombinant allergens (see Table 3.2) may help.
• May be linked to pollen allergies (Birch, Bet v1, Bet v2).
• Direct SPTS with fresh fruits/vegetables may be helpful.
• Knowledge of the cross-reacting families is helful (see Table 3.2).
• Full details of key allergens can be found at:
www.phadia.com/en-GB/allergens.

Treatment
• Careful dietary review is required; patients need to be made aware of
potential cross-reactions.
• For heat-labile allergens, cooked fruits are usually not a problem. For
fresh fruits (apples) 10-15 seconds in a microwave on full power is
usually enough to destroy the allergens which are concentrated under
the skin).
• An estimate of the likelihood of severe reactions needs to be made
(require adrenaline for self-injection).
• Typical OAS patients require only standby antihistamines + prednisolone
(cetirizine 20mg chewed + prednisolone 20mg as stat dose).

Risk stratiﬁcation and role of food challenge
An increasing problem for adult allergists is the question of whether young
adults with a history with a childhood history of nut/peanut allergy have

outgrown their allergy. This may have employment implications (e.g. entry

• The use of recombinant peanut allergens may provide prognostic
information.
• Positivity for rAra h2 is associated with risk of severe systemic
reactions.
• Positivity for rAra h8 is associated with localized OAS symptoms.
• Food challenges with graded exposure may be required to conﬁrm
reactivity.

Desensitization to foods
• Desensitization to peanut using peanut ﬂour has been used with
success.
• The identiﬁcation of key allergens is likely to lead to suitable
immunotherapeutic vaccines.
• Anti-IgE therapy (omalizumab) may be valuable as sole or adjunctive
therapy.

Latex allergy
Latex allergy is an increasing problem in hospitals, mainly triggered by the
massive increase in latex glove usage during the 1980s when AIDS was
identiﬁed. Up to 20% of staff in high glove usage areas (theatres, ITU) may
become sensitized to latex.

Presentation
• Type I reactions occur with anaphylaxis, asthma, angioedema,
rhinoconjunctivitis, and contact urticaria.
• Typical reactions occur with gloves, condoms, and new elasticated
clothing.
• Range of latex-containing domestic and medical products is very large.

153

154

CHAPTER 3

Allergic disease

• Cross-reaction to foods is frequent: bananas, avocado, kiwi fruit,
potato, tomato, chestnut, lettuce, pineapple, papaya.
• Type IV reactions occur due to plasticizers used in the manufacture
(not latex), and cause a localized dermatitis.

Cause
• Type I reactions develop against a range of proteins present in the
latex.

Immunology and diagnosis
• Current speciﬁc IgE tests (RAST) identify only 85% of allergic patients.
• Recombinant allergens are now available (see Box 3.5).
• SPT with commercial latex solutions (preferably from two different
manufacturers) identiﬁes 96% of allergic patients.
• A proportion of patients have clear histories of reactions on exposure,
but no positive tests: challenge tests may be required: blind glove
challenge (in a box); open glove challenge, and SPT with prick through
a glove have all been used.
• Type IV reactions are identiﬁed by patch testing.

Management
• For type I reactions avoidance is required. This requires education of
patient and employers.
• Occupational issues are difﬁcult, especially in the health service.
• Latex is a substance identiﬁed in COSHH regulations as hazardous to
health. Therefore employers are required by law to minimize exposure
and carry out risk assessments where latex is used. Employees have
successfully sued for large sums of money where this has not been done.
• Latex-allergic patients often develop an anxiety depression related to
their inability to avoid latex and subsequent reactions. Support from
psychologists is required.
• Attendance at A&E is often difﬁcult. Consideration of management
of anaphylaxis away from hospital, including self-administration of
hydrocortisone may be desirable.
• The Latex Allergy Support Group will provide information on the
latex content of products (http://www.lasg.org.uk/).
• Pharmacy will advise on latex content of drugs. Latex is used in bungs
in drug vials.

DRUG ALLERGY 1: PENICILLIN, OTHER ANTIBIOTICS, AND INSULIN

• Supplies departments should be able to access information on the
latex content of hospital products.
• Hospitals should keep identiﬁed boxes of latex-free equipment in key
areas (theatres, A&E, medical admissions).
• The Health and Safety Executive requires all employers to have
policies on latex. The HSE website contains further advice (http://www.
hse.gov.uk/skin/employ/latex.htm). Hospitals should also have a speciﬁc
risk management committee to review these policies for staff and
patients.

Drug allergy 1: penicillin, other
antibiotics, and insulin
Drugs may cause allergic reactions due to all four mechanisms of hypersensitivity or combinations thereof. For example, penicillin may cause anaphylaxis (type I), a haemolytic anaemia (type II), serum sickness (type III),
and interstitial nephritis (type IV). As noted earlier, drugs may also cause
reactions through other mechanisms, such as direct histamine release
(opiates, radiocontrast media), undue sensitivity to the pharmacological
effect (NSAIDs), and direct complement activation. Drug fever may be
the primary manifestation of an adverse reaction to antibiotics. This may
be difﬁcult to detect when the drug is an antibiotic being used to treat an
infective condition, where the reappearance of fever may lead to further
investigation for an infective focus. The CRP will also be elevated during
a drug fever.

Penicillin allergy
• Penicillin allergy is very common, perhaps occurring in up to 8% of
treatment courses. Most of the reactions are trivial. Severe reactions
are rare and occur mainly after parenteral administration.
• Occasional patients react on apparent ﬁrst exposure and it has been
suggested that sensitization may occur through antibiotics present in
food.
• All four types of Gell and Coombs’ hypersensitivity reactions may
occur with penicillin, together with reactions of uncertain signiﬁcance
such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome.
• There are major antigenic determinants (benzylpenicilloyl nucleus) and
minor determinants (benzylpenicillin, benzylpenicilloate, and others),
although both are capable of causing severe immediate reactions.
• Currently available tests (RAST and SPT/IDT) detect only major
determinants, although benzylpenicillin may detect some minordeterminant-only reactions if suitably diluted and used for SPT.
• Tests for IgE (i.e. RAST and SPT) have no predictive value for
other types of reactions. Up to 3% of SPT-negative patients may
subsequently have reactions, although the reaction rate falls if both
major and all minor antigens are used for testing. Some recent studies
have claimed very few false-negative results with SPT. Conversely, not
all SPT-positive patients will react when subsequently challenged.

CHAPTER 3

Allergic disease

• There have been difﬁculties in obtaining skin-test reagents containing
minor determinants, which makes accurate testing difﬁcult.
• Up to 75% of patients who have had a reaction to penicillin will
tolerate the drug subsequently. This probably applies to patients with
non-speciﬁc reactions of dubious allergic aetiology (nausea, vomiting,
diarrhoea), but more care should be taken in patients with a history of
angioedema, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, etc.
• There is a high level of cross-reactivity with other semi-synthetic
penicillins with a B-lactam ring, such as the carbapenems and the
monobactams (up to 50% in the case of imipenem), for IgE-mediated
reactions.
• Cephalosporins and cephacarbams also cross-react, but at a lower
level: up to 5.6% of penicillin-allergic (SPT-positive) patients may also
react to cephalosporins. Older ﬁgures are higher, but may relate to
ﬁrst-generation cephalosporins. Anaphylaxis to cephalosporins is
said to be very unlikely if there are no responses to major or minor
determinants of penicillin. In some cases the IgE is directed not at the
nucleus but at the side-chain, which may be shared between a penicillin
and a cephalosporin (e.g. aztreonam and ceftazidime).
• The speciﬁc morbilliform rash associated with the administration of
amoxicillin to patients with acute EBV infection does not indicate a
likelihood of subsequent true penicillin allergy.
Management
• The management of the penicillin-allergic patient depends on obtaining
a clear history from the patient.
• Avoidance is the best course for patients with severe reactions,
including other semi-synthetic B-lactam antibiotics.
• If penicillin or an equivalent is essential, rush desensitization schedules
may be used, although there is a high risk of reactions for which
supportive therapy will be required. The desensitization must be
followed by the treatment course and there is no lasting tolerance.
Desensitization should not be attempted in those who have had a
Stevens-Johnson reaction.

Other antibiotics
• Little is written about true allergy to other antibiotics.
• Patients with AIDS have a very high reaction rate to trimethoprim-
sulfamethoxazole. This has been associated with IgE to a derivative of
the sulfamethoxazole.
• Abnormal metabolism with generation of toxic intermediates has been
proposed as a mechanism for the generation of erythema multiforme
and Stevens-Johnson syndrome. Cross-reactivity to sulphonamides
may also affect other drugs that are closely related such as furosemide,
hydrochlorothiazide, and captopril.
• Skin-prick and intradermal testing can be carried out where reactions
are suggestive of a type I reaction (but not in those with a Stevens-
Johnson reaction).

DRUG ALLERGY 2

Insulin allergy
• Insulin allergy may occur due to changes in the tertiary structure of
insulin engendered in the manufacturing process for human insulin,
or previously due to the sequence differences in bovine and porcine
insulin, with the production of IgE antibodies. These do not recognize
natural human insulin.
• Other components such as protamine and zinc may also cause allergic
reactions.
• There is urticaria at the site of injections and frequently induration.
Rarely, systemic reactions occur.
• Treatment is difﬁcult: local reaction may be amenable to the
prophylactic use of antihistamines or the inclusion of a tiny dose of
hydrocortisone (1-5mg) with the insulin.
• ‘Desensitization’ regimes have been used where there are major
problems and diabetic control has failed.
• Skin testing with a range of insulins may be appropriate.
Desensitization may be undertaken with the least reactive.

Drug allergy 2: anaesthetic allergy,
diagnosis and treatment of drug
allergies, and drug-induced
Stevens-Johnson syndrome
Anaesthetic allergy
• The major difﬁculty in the investigation of anaesthetic reactions is that
multiple drugs are administered nearly simultaneously.
• Patients suffering an acute reaction to anaesthetics should be
referred to a specialist centre for investigation (the Royal College
of Anaesthetists has produced guidelines on management for
anaesthetists).
• Conﬁrmation of the reaction at the time requires a blood sample for
mast-cell tryptase, complement C3 and C4, and albumin (calculation of
dilutional effects).
• Complex regimes of serial blood sampling have been recommended;
these are impractical and add nothing to the subsequent investigation.
• Measurement of speciﬁc IgE at the time of the reaction is unhelpful, as
a negative result may be due to consumption.
• Detailed anaesthetic records must be forwarded to the drug allergy
testing unit.
• Some of the drugs used (opiate derivatives) are capable of inducing
mast-cell degranulation, while solvents such as cremophor, used to
dissolve lipophilic drugs, may activate the complement system.
• Problems of severe reactions perioperatively may also arise from
synthetic plasma expanders and blood products and in patients with
unrecognized (or ignored) sensitivity to latex.

157

158

CHAPTER 3

Allergic disease

• There is extensive cross-reactivity between the neuromuscular
blocking agents; prior exposure is not necessary (possibly crossreaction with microbial products or prior exposure to the cough
suppressant pholcodine).
• RAST tests for speciﬁc IgE are currently limited commercially to
suxamethonium and thiopental, although research centres may have
tests for IgE to other agents.
• Skin-prick and intradermal testing are necessary to identify causative
agents and identify safe alternatives.
• Challenge testing should only be carried out with full resuscitation
facilities to hand.
• Guidance on testing is detailed in Chapter 19.

Local anaesthetics
• Local anaesthetics may cause both type I and type IV reactions, so a
careful history is required to identify the nature of the reaction and
guide subsequent testing.
• IgE-mediated allergy to local anaesthetics is rare.
• Overdose of local anaesthetic may cause signiﬁcant adverse reactions;
it is essential to exclude this possibility.
• Inadvertent intravenous administration may give rise to non-speciﬁc
symptoms; these are not due to allergy and do not contraindicate
further use.
• Vasovagal reactions need to be identiﬁed.
• Local anaesthetics divide into two groups: group I are the benzoic acid
esters, including benzocaine and procaine; group II are the amides,
including lidocaine, bupivacaine, and prilocaine. There is little crossreactivity between the two groups, but there is often cross-reactivity
within the groups.
• Local anaesthetics may contain sulphites (particularly if adrenaline is
present) and other preservatives such as parabens, which may cause
adverse reactions in their own right.
• Articaine appears to be the local anaesthetic least likely to cause
reactions and is the drug of choice where there is doubt about
previous reaction history.

Diagnosis (see Box 3.6)
• Diagnosis of drug reactions requires a good history.
• Investigation of an acute reaction requires conﬁrmation of the nature
of the reaction.
• Ideally, it should be possible to measure complement breakdown
products (C3d, C3a, C5a) and urinary methylhistamine but, because
of the withdrawal of appropriate commercial assays and the need for
usually unobtainable stabilizers in blood tubes (Futhan-EDTA), these
additional tests are not usually done.
• Some authorities recommend complex time schedules for blood
sampling post-reaction. These are impractical and never adhered to; if
the laboratory gets one post-reaction clotted sample it has done well!
• Reliable speciﬁc IgE tests are available to only a few drugs (thiopental,
suxamethonium, major determinants of penicillin).

DRESS SYNDROME

• SPT followed by intradermal testing is required (see Chapter 19 for
suggested protocols).
• Challenge tests are of more value, but are time-consuming and
potentially dangerous.

Box 3.6 Testing for drug allergy
Immediate tests

Later tests

Mast-cell tryptase, C3, C4, as soon after
the reaction as possible and at 24 hours

Refer to immunologist/allergist
for investigation

Serum albumin

Speciﬁc IgE, SPT, and
intradermal testing: FlowCAST®; drug challenge (DBPC)

DBPC, double-blind placebo-controlled challenge

Treatment
• Treatment of all drug reactions involves immediate cessation of the
drug and, if the reaction is severe, resuscitation as for anaphylaxis
(see ‘Anaphylaxis’, pp.120-5).
• Appropriate warnings should be incorporated into the notes.
• Patients must be informed of the cause of their reaction and, if it is
thought likely to recur, they should be advised to wear a Medic-Alert
bracelet or equivalent.

Drug-induced Stevens-Johnson syndrome
• Drugs, particularly sulphonamides and penicillins, may cause the
Stevens-Johnson syndrome. The immunological mechanism is
uncertain.
• 0 Stevens-Johnson syndrome is a contraindication to any form of
cutaneous challenge testing or further administration of the drug.
• A useful source of information on drug allergy can be found at http://
www.phadia.com/PageFiles/27357/Drug-Book-web.pdf

DRESS syndrome
DRESS: drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms

Presentation
• Begins several weeks after starting the drug. Drugs involved include:
• sulphonamides, dapsone, minocycline, carbamazepine, phenytoin,
lamotrigine, modaﬁnil, allopurinol.
• Features include rash (generalized), fever (>38ºC, lymphadenopathy,
evidence of at least one internal organ involved, and haemtaological
abnormalities.
• Organ involvement:
• liver (80%), kidney (40%), lung (33%)
• Haematological abnormalities include:

159

160

CHAPTER 3

Allergic disease

• eosinophilia, lymphopenia/lymphocytosis, thrombocytopenia.
• Mortality up to 10%.

Diagnosis
• Typical features and associated drug therapy.
• No speciﬁc immunological tests.

Treatment
• Stop offending drug (and do not reintroduce!).
• Treat with corticosteroids.

Vaccine reactions
Vaccines have been blamed for a multitude of medical problems. Frequent
concerns are raised about egg allergy and vaccination, latex allergy, and
allergy to antibiotics.

Vaccine composition
• Depends on vaccine.
• May contain egg proteins (viral vaccines grown in eggs), antibiotics
(neomycin), and latex components (stoppers, manufacturing plant
equipment).
• May contain other preservatives.

Egg allergy
• Data for the ovalbumin contain of ﬂu vaccines are now published each
year, available through the Department of Health’s Green Book on
Infectious Diseases (now only in electronic form!): http://www.dh.gov.
uk/en/Publichealth/Immunisation/Greenbook/index.htm
• Advice is available: the BSACI has published a position statement
on egg allergy including advice: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/
doi/10.1111/j.1365-2222.2010.03557.x/pdf
• Patients whose history is uncertain should be formally investigated
by an allergist/immunologist to conﬁrm or refute the diagnosis of egg
allergy.
• Almost all patients will tolerate vaccines with very low ovalbumin
content unless they still have severe reactions to egg.

Latex allergy
• Drug information departments can obtain information on latex content
of ﬂu vaccines; information is also available from the Latex Allergy
Support Group.

Antibiotic allergy
• Conﬁrmatory tests may be required (patch testing for neomycin).
• Decision on safety can be taken on a patient-by-patient basis,
depending on need.

Adjuvant-induced disease
• Controversial.

VENOM ALLERGY

• Claimed that adjuvants may trigger an autoimmune process, leading to
CFS-like syndrome.
• Immunological evidence is lacking so far.

Venom allergy
Allergy to bee and wasp venom can be associated with severe reactions.
It is most common in those with occupational risk factors (bee keepers,
gardeners, forestry workers, pest controllers).

Presentation
• Systemic reactions (anaphylaxis).
• Large local reactions (not usually IgE-mediated).
• Identity of the insect may be in doubt.

Diagnosis
• SPT with graded concentrations of venom is helpful. Bee and wasp
stings should always be tested, unless the history is very clear (e.g.
beekeeper stung at hive).
• Double positives may be seen due to cross-reactive carbohydrate
determinants—test for speciﬁc IgE to recombinant bee allergens to
identify the primary sensitizer.
• If there is a good history and negative SPTs, consider intradermal
testing.

Treatment
• Give avoidance advice: no perfumes, no brightly coloured clothes, no
bare feet in gardens, avoid fallen fruit.
• For severe systemic reactions provide emergency treatment kit:
adrenaline for self-injection (see ‘Indications for prescription of
adrenaline for self-injection’, p.124), prednisolone, cetirizine.
• Consider immunotherapy.
• Large local reactions are not an indication for immunotherapy.
• Cardiac disease is not a contraindication, as risk of death from wild
sting is high—get cardiology opinion ﬁrst.
• B-blockers may provide cardioprotection and are not necessarily
a contraindication (provide half-strength adrenaline for selfinjection—0.15mg per pen).
• ACE-inhibitors must be stopped (use ARB) as reactions will be
severe (both wild and treatment) and accompanied by more
marked swelling and hypotension.
• Risk of severe reactions returns to baseline anyway over 10 years.
• Some authorities advocate sting challenge at the end of
immunotherapy (no consensus).
• No consensus on optimum duration of treatment (3-5 years)
• Immunotherapy may be carried out as normal, semi-rush, or rush,
depending on urgency.

161

162

CHAPTER 3

Allergic disease

• It should not be carried out during ﬂying season for insects (risk of
wild sting).
• Other insects may cause speciﬁc problems: e.g. bumblebees in
commercial fruit growers (vaccine available), hornets (some parts of
UK and Europe), ﬁre ants (USA).

Extrinsic allergic alveolitis (EAA)
Presentation
• Typical features of EAA are fever, shortness of breath, and cough
within 4-6 hours of allergen exposure, i.e. much slower than for type I
reactions. Rhonchi are present and there is acute hypoxaemia.
• About 10% of patients are also asthmatic and then show both an
immediate (type I) and a later (type III) reaction.
• For occupational allergens, features are often most marked on Monday
morning (after a weekend free of exposure) and improve somewhat
later in the week. This is ‘Monday morning fever’.
• Chronic allergen exposure leads to a more insidious deterioration in
lung function, often without much in the way of fever but a steadily
progressive shortness of breath.

Cause
• EAA is a hypersensitivity reaction mediated by IgG, mainly through
a type III reaction, although there may well be a type IV reaction in
addition. The antigens are inhaled and must be of such a size (<5mm)
to enable them to penetrate to the alveolus.
• Many different antigens have been associated with this type of disease,
including animal, fungal, bacterial, plant, and chemical allergens. Many
are associated with occupational exposure. In the UK, the most widely
recognized diseases are bird-fancier’s lung (pigeons, caged birds) and
farmer’s lung (thermophilic fungi).
• Curiously, smoking appears to have a protective effect against the
development of EAA. This may be due to the inhibition of macrophage
function.

Immunology
• Total IgG is often raised and precipitating IgG antibodies to the
offending allergen may be detected. However, these speciﬁc antibodies
are a marker of exposure and do not correlate with the presence of
disease. Precipitins may also decline with time, so that a negative test
does not exclude the diagnosis.
• IgE levels are not usually elevated and speciﬁc IgE is not detected; SPT
has no role in the diagnosis of type III reactions.
• In the acute stage, there is a peripheral blood neutrophilia rather than
the eosinophilia seen in type I reactions.
• Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) studies typically show a lymphocytosis
with a reversal of the normal CD4+:CD8+ T-cell ratio due to
an expansion of the CD8+ T-cell population. The CD8+ T cells

ALLERGIC BRONCHOPULMONARY ASPERGILLOSIS (ABPA)

show evidence of activation, expressing CD25 and VLA antigens.
However, as with precipitins, BAL also shows changes in exposed but
asymptomatic individuals, although the most extreme elevations of
CD8+ T cells are seen in those with active disease.

Diagnosis
• The diagnosis is based on typical symptoms together with evidence of
allergen exposure.
• Precipitin tests provide supportive evidence only.
• The chronic disease, with interstitial changes, may be difﬁcult to
diagnose, but BAL may help differentiate EAA from sarcoidosis and
idiopathic pulmonary ﬁbrosis.
• In the occupational setting, challenge tests within an environmental
chamber may be required as proof positive of the causal link. Pure
allergens are required and the process may make the patient seriously
unwell.

Treatment
• Avoidance is the mainstay. This may require difﬁcult decisions if the
patient’s livelihood is affected, hence the need for positive evidence
of causation through a challenge. If the disease is identiﬁed early and
the allergen exposure terminated, no permanent harm will be done.
However, in chronic cases, if ﬁbrotic lung damage has occurred, this
will be irreversible.
• Oral corticosteroids may help to deal with acute symptoms.

Allergic bronchopulmonary
aspergillosis (ABPA)
Presentation
• ABPA is a speciﬁc entity in which there are both type I and type III
reactions to Aspergillus.
• Presentation is with bouts of wheeze, fever, cough, and haemoptysis.
• Bronchiectasis may develop.
• Chest radiographs show transient inﬁltrates.
• Symptoms are often most marked in the winter.
• Similar features of a mixed type I and type III response to Aspergillus
may occur in some patients with cystic ﬁbrosis. This appears to be a
poor prognostic sign.

Cause
• The causative fungus, Aspergillus, is usually present in the sputum of
patient with ABPA. It can be seen on microscopy and often cultured
from serial specimens.

Immunology
• Both IgE and IgG precipitins to the relevant strain of Aspergillus can be
detected.

163

164

CHAPTER 3

Allergic disease

• SPTs against Aspergillus are also strongly positive and give both an
immediate and a late response.
• Total IgE is usually very high and there is a marked peripheral blood
eosinophilia during acute episodes. Both fall during remission.

Treatment
• Acute ﬂares are treated with high-dose corticosteroids; some patients
require continuous low-dose steroids to maintain remission.
• Bronchodilators are also required.
• Immunotherapy with extracts of Aspergillus is unhelpful!

Other pulmonary eosinophilic
syndromes
Other pulmonary eosinophilic syndromes
• Pulmonary eosinophilia may also be caused by drug reactions, parasitic
infestations (Ascaris, Strongyloides, ﬁlariasis), vasculitis (Churg-Strauss
vasculitis (see Chapter 13)), and idiopathic eosinophilic pneumonias
including Löfﬂer’s syndrome and hypereosinophilic syndromes.
• Diagnosis can be difﬁcult. Involvement of other organs may occur.
• There are no speciﬁc immunological tests of value.
• Idiopathic pulmonary eosinophilia is treated with steroids and is
exquisitely sensitive to very small doses.

Allergic renal disease
Allergic renal disease

• A seasonal nephrotic syndrome has been described in atopic patients,
corresponding to the pollen season.
• IgE has been documented in the glomeruli.
• This appears to be very rare.

Hyper-eosinophilic syndromes (HES)
The investigation of hyper-eosinophilia is difﬁcult. Presentations vary
widely and the response to treatment is equally variable. Cardiac involvement may occur.

Causes
• Causes are numerous (see Table 3.3).
• Elevations of IL-5 may be responsible in some cases.

Diagnosis
• Low levels of eosinophilia ((0.4-3.0)x109/L) may be associated with
atopic disease.

• Echocardiography and ECG should be carried out to check for cardiac
involvement.
• IgE levels will be raised signiﬁcantly in Job’s syndrome, atopic eczema,
and sometimes CSS.

Treatment
• Treatment will depend on the underlying diagnosis.
• Corticosteroids are the ﬁrst-line treatment.

165

166

CHAPTER 3

Allergic disease

• Second-line treatments include hydroxycarbamide, A-interferon and
tyrosine kinase inghibitors.
• Anti-IL-5 MAbs (mepolizumab) may be helpful.
• Some idiopathic HES patients may be exquisitely sensitive to tiny doses
of steroid (1-3mg per day!).
• Cardiac monitoring may be necessary.

•

Autoimmune hyperthyroidism
Graves’ disease
Autoimmune thyroiditis
Hashimoto’s thyroiditis
Post-partum thyroiditis
Atrophic thyroiditis

Graves’ disease
Presentation
• Usually presents with thyrotoxicosis and a diffusely enlarged thyroid
gland.
• Often accompanied by exophthalmos and occasionally by thyroid
acropachy.

Immunogenetics
• Strong female predominance—F:M = 7:1.
• Disease runs in families and it is associated with HLA-A1 B8 DR3,
although less strongly than some other autoimmune diseases.
• In Asians the disease has been associated with HLA-Bw35 and Bw46.
• Strong association of exophthalmos with HLA-DR3.
• There is a weak association with polymorphisms of CTLA-4 and
PTPN22 (a T-cell regulatory gene, lymphocyte-speciﬁc tryrosine
phosphatase).

Immunopathology
• The disease has been associated with aberrant MHC class II expression
on thyrocytes, which is thought to play a role in the induction of the
autoimmune response.
• There is predominant CD4+ T-cell inﬁltration of the thyroid gland.
• Exophthalmos may be due to an autoantibody directed to unknown
antigens expressed on retro-orbital connective tissue, probably
ﬁbroblasts or fat cells, leading to a localized inﬂammatory response,
with plasma-cell inﬁltrate and consequent hypertrophy and hyperplasia.

Autoantibodies
• Patients with Graves’ disease have elevated levels of the following.
• Antibodies to thyroid peroxidase (present in 50-80%) and
antibodies to thyroglobulin (20-40%).
• Thyroid-stimulating antibodies, both growth-promoting (TGSI,
20-50%) and stimulating (TSI, 50-90%).
• Antibodies that compete with the binding of thyroid-stimulating
hormone (TSH) (TBII, 50-80%). These autoantibodies are directly
involved in the pathogenic process.

HASHIMOTO’S THYROIDITIS

• Graves’ goitre has been associated with stimulating autoantibodies
to both the TSH receptor (TSH-R) and the insulin-like growth factor
receptor (IGF1-R), which both promote growth of the gland.
• Presence of TSI and TBII correlate with risk of relapse and of neonatal
hyperthyroidism if present in pregnancy.
• Exophthalmos may be due to a separate autoantibody directed against
yet unknown antigens or due to antibodies to autoantigens that are
common to both the thyroid gland and the orbits.

Immunotherapy
• Treatment of the thyrotoxicosis does not involve immunotherapy.
• Eye disease may require treatment with steroids, ciclosporin, or
irradiation to control the inﬂammatory process. Rituximab is now
being used. Surgical intervention may be required.
• 125I ablation of the thyroid to control the thyrotoxicosis may be
associated with a ﬂare-up of the eye disease, and pretreatment with
steroids may be helpful.

Hashimoto’s thyroiditis
Presentation
• Patients are usually hyperthyroid initially and then progress to
hypothyroidism as ﬁbrosis of the gland occurs.
• There is usually a goitre.
• It is the most common cause of hypothyroidism.
• Hashimoto’s thyroiditis also tends to occur in families with other
thyroid disease or autoimmune disease, and has a predilection for
older females.

Immunogenetics
• Association of DR5 with goitrous Hashimoto’s disease.
• DR3 and DR4 are also associated.

Immunopathology
• There is an acute inﬂammatory thyroiditis, accompanied by a
lymphocytic inﬁltrate of the gland of unknown aetiology.
• Lymphocytic inﬁltrate comprises all types of cells and may result in
germinal centre formation within the gland. These may play a key role
in the production of autoantibodies and cytokines.
• Increased HLA class II antigen expression on inﬁltrating lymphocytes
and thyrocytes in affected glands.
• An increased number of helper and cytotoxic T cells are found with
decreased suppressor T-cell numbers.

169

170

CHAPTER 4

Autoimmunity and the endocrine system

Autoantibodies
• Anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies will be present in 80-95% of
patients, usually at extremely high titres (higher than in Graves’
disease).
• Autoantibodies to multiple other thyroid antigens, including
thyroglobulin, can be detected.
• Up to 20% of patients may have antibodies (stimulatory or blocking)
directed at the TSH receptor.
• Anti-TPO assays should be incorporated in main biochemistry
analysers as part of thyroid proﬁles.

Immunotherapy
• No immunotherapeutic manoeuvres are used.

Subacute thyroiditis syndromes
• These include transient thyroiditis syndromes such as granulomatous
thyroiditis (de Quervain’s syndrome) and post-partum thyroiditis.
• Patients are initially hyperthyroid but may become transiently
hypothyroid in recovery before the euthyroid state is restored.

Immunopathology
• de Quervain’s thyroiditis may be caused by viral infections (mumps,
measles, adenovirus, EBV, Coxsackievirus, and echovirus) which lead
to an acute painful thyroiditis.
• No single agent has been unequivocally linked to the disease.
• Anti-thyroid antibodies against thyroglobulin and thyroid
peroxidase are present (usually in low titres) in 10-50% of patients
with de Quervain’s thyroiditis.
• Post-partum thyroiditis usually occurs within 3 months of delivery and
is usually painless.
• It appears to be common (1-11% of pregnant women).
• It is associated with HLA-DR5.
• Complement-ﬁxing anti-TPO antibodies are present in the majority
of patients and the titre correlates with disease severity.
• The presence of such antibodies during or after pregnancy in
otherwise well women has a predictive value of subsequent thyroid
dysfunction.

Immunotherapy
• No immunotherapeutic manoeuvres are used.

Primary hypothyroidism and

Primary hypothyroidism
• This may well be caused by previous occult thyroiditis, leading
eventually to presentation with overt hypothyroidism years later.
• There may be a lymphocytic inﬁltrate of the gland with marked ﬁbrosis.
Autoantibodies
• 80% of patients will have antibodies to thyroid peroxidase, and a lower
proportion will have antibodies to thyroglobulin.
• Some cases may have antibodies that block the TSH-R, preventing
normal function.
Immunotherapy
• No immunological treatments are used.

Sporadic goitre
• This has been associated with stimulating autoantibodies to the IGF1-R,
in the absence of other antibodies, leading to glandular growth.

Thyroid disease and other symptoms
Arthropathy
• Both hypo- and hyperthyroidism can be a cause of signiﬁcant joint pain.
• Therefore detection of thyroid antibodies in a patient with joint pain
may be signiﬁcant and should not be ignored.

Urticaria
• Occult hypo- or hyperthyroidism has also been associated with the
development of urticaria, although the reasons are unclear.
• Unfortunately, the urticaria does not always settle when the thyroid
abnormality is treated.
• The association appears to be with thyroid peroxidase antibodies.

CHAPTER 4

Autoimmunity and the endocrine system

Anti-thyroid antibodies in euthryoid patients
• The wider use of autoantibody testing has led to the detection of antithyroid antibodies in ﬁt euthyroid patients.
• The Wickham Community Survey has demonstrated that a signiﬁcant
number of these patients go on to develop overt thyroid disease
subsequently.
• Therefore the detection of such antibodies in asymptomatic patients
should lead to a high index of suspicion for thyroid disease and a
low threshold for requesting thyroid function tests when the patient
re-presents with symptoms.
• It may be worth screening the thyroid function annually.

Association with other autoimmune disease
• Autoimmune thyroid disease is strongly associated with pernicious
anaemia and vice versa.
• Therefore gastric parietal cell antibodies may be detected in patients
with thyroid disease.
• Such patients should be monitored for the subsequent development of
B12 deﬁciency.
• Thyroid disease may be accompanied by Addison’s disease, in addition
to pernicious anaemia (Schmidt’s syndrome/type II autoimmune
polyglandular syndrome (APS)).
• Generally, patients and family members of a patient with Graves’ disease
are more likely to have other autoimmune disease (e.g. type I diabetes,
lupus erythematosus, chronic active hepatitis, coeliac disease, dermatitis
herpetiformis, Sjögren’s syndrome) than the general population.

Autoantibodies to thyroxine
• May be seen in para-proteinaemic states (Waldenström’s
macroglobulinaemia).
• Cause hypothyroidism.
• Interfere with assays for free thyroxine (FT4).

Amiodarone and thyroid function
• Amiodarone-induced thyroid disease is more common in women and
in individuals who are positive for antibodies to TPO.

Classiﬁcation of diabetes mellitus
• There are four types of diabetes.
• Type Ia (immune-mediated) or insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus
(IDDM).
• Type Ib: as type Ia but without evidence of immune involvement.
• Type II or non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM).
• Type III: due to other genetic defects, insulin resistance syndromes,
other endocrinopathies, etc.
• There is considerable clinical overlap, although type II does not have
an immunological basis.

TYPE I DIABETES (INSULIN-DEPENDENT)

Type I diabetes (insulin-dependent)
Presentation
Patients may present with symptoms related to an elevated blood sugar,
or a raised fasting blood sugar level may be an isolated ﬁnding.

Immunogenetics
• Males and females are almost equally affected, unlike other
autoimmune diseases.
• Twin concordance for IDDM is only 30-70%.
• Major susceptibility gene is in HLA region, accounting for 40-60% of
risk.
• Genotyping has shown that DQA1*0301, DQB1*0302, DQA1*0501,
and DQB1*0201 are strongly associated with type Ia.
• DQA1*0102 and DQB1*0602 protect against the development of
diabetes.
• CTLA-4 and PTPN22, the interleukin-2 receptor (CD25), interferoninduced helicase, and a number of other genes (including some of
unidentiﬁed function) are also associated with increased susceptibility
to type I diabetes.
• Other speciﬁc loci have been associated with the shared risk of
developing coeliac disease with diabetes, although the effects are small.
The greatest risk appears to be with CCR5.
• At least 17 other genetic loci contribute to susceptibility including
polymorphisms in the promoter of the insulin gene.
• Tenfold increased risk of developing diabetes in family members.

Immunopathology
• A disease characterized by immunological destruction of the islets of
Langerhans in the pancreas, with subsequent insulinopenia.
• There is a seasonal ﬂuctuation in the presentation.
• It has been postulated that there is an initial viral infection, leading to
subsequent autoimmune damage in a genetically susceptible host.
• Viruses that have been proposed include Coxsackievirus, reovirus,
mumps, inﬂuenza, rubella, and cytomegalovirus.
• In the early stages of the disease there is a lymphocytic inﬁltrate,
predominantly of CD8+ T cells but with small numbers of other types
too.
• Islet B-cells are particularly susceptible to damage by TNF-A.
• As diabetes has been described in a patient with X-linked
agammaglobulinaemia, T cells are more important than autoantibodies
in causing diabetes.

Autoantibodies
• GAD autoantibodies.
• B-cell-speciﬁc antibodies have been detected that recognize
glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD).
• This antigen occurs in both nerve and pancreas in two isoforms
(65kDa and 67kDa) encoded by separate genes.

173

174

CHAPTER 4

•

•

•

•

•

Autoimmunity and the endocrine system

• Autoantibodies against this antigen have also been described in the
stiff-person syndrome (see Chapter 5).
• Primary target in type Ia diabetes appears to be the 65kDa protein,
and antibodies to this are found in up to 80% of newly presenting
IDDM.
• Antibodies to GAD-67 are also found.
• There is sequence homology between GAD and a Coxsackievirus
antigen.
• GAD autoantibodies may be found in ﬁrst-degree relatives.
Insulinoma-associated protein 2 autoantibodies (IA2).
• IA2 antibodies are found in 58% of type I diabetics at ﬁrst diagnosis.
• They appear later than GAD and insulin antibodies but strongly
predict progression to diabetes.
Zinc transporter (ZnT8) autoantibodies.
• 60-80% of newly diagnosed type I diabetics have antibodies to
ZnT8.
• They may be the only autoantibody detectable in patients negative
for GAD, IA-2, and insulin antibodies.
• They appear early in the process and are lost quickly after the
onset of diabetes.
• Polymorphisms of the gene for ZnT8 are associated with Type II
diabetes.
Insulin autoantibodies (IAA).
• Insulin antibodies appear ﬁrst in children developing diabetes.
• As insulin antibodies develop in patients treated with insulin,
they cannot be used as diagnostic markers once insulin has been
commenced.
Islet cell autoantibodies (ICA).
• ICA also recognize cell types in the islets other than the insulinproducing B-cells.
• ICA are not involved in the autoimmune destruction, but are
merely a marker of the disease process (secondary autoantibodies).
• With the identiﬁcation of more speciﬁc markers, the role of ICA in
diagnosis is uncertain.
• Antibodies are present in 65-85% of newly presenting IDDM, but
disappear within 1-2 years.
• They also occur in the ﬁrst-degree relatives of patients with IDDM,
who have a high risk of developing the disease.
• Studies in healthy children have shown that large numbers have
ICA but do not progress to diabetes.
Autoantibodies have also been described to a number of other
putative target antigens although the relevance of these is yet to be
determined.
• Insulin (30-50% IDDM positive for insulin antibodies by radioimmunoassay (RIA)), more common in children developing IDDM.
• Gangliosides, GT3, GM2, and others, antigens shared between
B-cells and neuronal tissue.
• An autoantigen that cross-reacts with a rubella capsid antigen.
• A glucose transporter (GLUT-2, not B-cell speciﬁc).

TYPE I DIABETES (INSULIN-DEPENDENT)

•
•
•

•
•

• ICA p69, which has sequence homology with bovine serum
albumin.
• ICA-512, a protein whose intracellular sequence has some
homology to other protein tyrosine phosphatases.
• Heat-shock protein 65 (Hsp65).
• Insulin receptor.
• Carboxypeptidase H.
Presence of autoantibodies is helpful in distinguishing type I and type II
diabetes.
Screening of ﬁrst-degree relatives for GAD and insulin antibodies may
be valuable in identifying those at risk of developing diabetes.
The optimal screening proﬁle for autoimmunity in type I diabetes has
not been deﬁned. It is likely that ICA will be replaced by an automated
screen of GAD, IA-2, insulin antibodies, and possibly ZnT8 (although
no commercial assays are yet available for this autoantigen).
The more autoantibodies that are present, the higher the risk of
developing diabetes.
For patients though to have type II diabetes, the presence of
autoantibodies is predictive of the need for insulin therapy.

Immunotherapy
• Identiﬁcation of patients in the pre-diabetic phase may well become
more important as trials of immunoregulatory therapies become more
widespread.
• The aim is to prevent damage to the islets, as presentation with
overt diabetes clearly represents the endstage of the disease when
insufﬁcient islet tissue remains.
• Studies of immunotherapy are aided by the existence of a mouse
model (NOD mouse).
• Aggressive therapy with corticosteroids, azathioprine, ciclosporin,
tacrolimus (FK506), and anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) has been tried
with some success in newly presenting patients and has staved off the
requirement for insulin for some time.
• Many monoclonal antibodies and polyclonal antibodies that are
directed against the T cell, including Campath®-1, anti-CD4, anti-CD8,
anti-CD45, are immunosuppressive and have been shown to prevent
the onset of diabetes in pre-diabetic NOD mice.
• Anti-CD3 mAbs are able to reverse diabetes in new-onset diabetic
NOD.
• Initial clinical trials in humans are promising with moderate loss of
B-cell function during and after therapy.
• Tolerance induction using parenterally administered GAD and heat
shock protein p277 peptide has been successfully used in mice. The
oral route has also been used.
• Clinical trials using Hsp p277, GAD, and insulin are under way in newly
diagnosed patients.
• Cytokine-based immunotherapy has been tried.
• In particular IL-4 has been targeted as a possible treatment,
although the feasibility of this remains to be conﬁrmed.

175

176

CHAPTER 4

Autoimmunity and the endocrine system

• The alternative cytokine-based approach consists of blocking IL-12
or G-IFN.
• Early insulin treatment may also assist by B-cell rest, and perhaps
by decreasing MHC class II expression, although the role of this in
diabetes is controversial.
• Other potential therapies include MHC class II blockade with peptides.
• Pancreatic islet cell transplantation is now being undertaken.

Association with other autoimmune disease
• There is a clinical association of type I diabetes with coeliac disease
and thyroid disease.
• In children, there is strong association with coeliac disease: all children
with type Ia diabetes need regular endomysial/tTG antibodies checking
(recommended annually).

Immunological complications of
insulin therapy
Allergic reactions
• As noted in Chapter 3, reactions to administered insulin may occur.
These are rare now that diabetics are treated with human insulin,
rather than that from pigs or cattle, but they still occur.
• The manufacturing process for human insulin is capable of altering
the tertiary structure of the molecule in a way that can render it
immunogenic.
• Other agents used to alter the pharmacokinetics of the drug, such as
zinc and protamine, may also contribute.
• Reactions may include local or generalized urticaria and, very rarely,
severe systemic reactions.
• Both immediate and late reactions may occur.
• Insulin oedema is non-immunological.
• Oral antihistamines and the inclusion of 1-5mg hydrocortisone in the
syringe with the insulin may be helpful.
• Desensitization may be possible, but should only be attempted where
severe reactions that compromise diabetic control are occurring.

CROW-FUKASE SYNDROME (POEMS SYNDROME; TAKATSUKI SYNDROME)

• Development of antibodies to protamine in diabetics may lead to
major systemic reactions if intravenous protamine is used to reverse
anticoagulation with heparin (e.g. after cardiac bypass surgery).
• IgE antibodies have been documented.

Insulin resistance
• Insulin resistance due to IgG anti-insulin antibodies may occur.
• It may arise spontaneously or as a result of attempted
desensitization where reactions have occurred.
• Resistance to insulin action may occur as a result of abnormalities
of the peripheral insulin receptor (type A: severe insulin resistance,
hirsutism, and acanthosis nigricans) or due to IgG insulinreceptor-blocking antibodies (type B: often associated with other
autoimmune diseases).
• Insulin resistance due to anti-insulin antibodies has also been reported
in ataxia telangiectasia.

Autoimmune insulin syndrome
• Autoantibodies against insulin may occur where the complexes
dissociate some hours after a meal, releasing free insulin and causing
hypoglycaemia.
• This is seen in Japan (possible genetic basis) and in association with
myeloma (paraprotein with speciﬁcity for insulin).

Crow-Fukase syndrome (POEMS
syndrome; Takatsuki syndrome)
• Characterized by:
• Polyneuropathy
• Organomegaly
• Endocrinopathy
• Monoclonal proteins
• Skin changes.
• Clinical features include the following.
• Papilloedema.
• Symmetrical distal polyneuropathy (motor and sensory); may cause
erectile dysfunction.
• Lung disease with pulmonary hypertension.
• Hepatosplenomegaly, lymphadenopathy.
• Peripheral and pulmonary oedema, pleural effusions, ascites.
• Hyperprolactinaemia causing amenorrhoea (women),
gynaecomastia (men), testicular atrophy, type II diabetes,
hypothyroidism, or adrenal insufﬁciency.
• Skin changes include thickening, hypertrichosis, hyperpigmentation,
clubbing, or sclerodermatous changes.
• Thrombophilia, cardiomyopathy, thromocytosis, and polycythaemia
may also occur.

177

178

CHAPTER 4

Autoimmunity and the endocrine system

• Plasma cell dyscrasia (IgG or IgA)—invariably λ light chain:
• osteosclerotic myeloma
• Castleman’s disease (non-clonal lymphoid proliferation due to IL-6
hypersecretion).
• May be due to elevated IL-6 and IL-1 levels.
• Elevated VEGF.
• Check serum immunoglobulins, electrophoresis, and immunoﬁxation.
• Treatment is with steroids and alkylating agents (cyclophosphamide).
• Bone marrow transplantation has been used successfully.
• Anti-VEGF MAb (bevacizumab) may be beneﬁcial in some cases but
can cause severe capillary leak syndrome.

Classiﬁcation of adrenal insufﬁciency
• Autoimmune Addison’s disease (most common cause in Western
countries)
• Tuberculosis (most common worldwide)
• Malignancy
• Sarcoidosis
• Haemochromatosis
• Haemorrhage (post-partum)
• Thrombosis (anti-phospholipid syndrome)
• Infections (fungi, viruses)
• Genetic causes include X-linked adrenoleucodystrophy, congenital
adrenal hypoplasia, familial glucocorticoid deﬁciency, triple A
syndrome, and Kearns-Sayre syndrome.

Addison’s disease
Presentation
• Includes collapse, faintness, nausea, weight loss, and anorexia.
• Findings include pigmentation, postural hypotension, hyponatraemia,
and an absent response to ACTH stimulation test (Synacthen® test).
• There is a strong association with autoimmune ovarian disease and
therefore females with Addison’s should also be checked for the
presence of ovarian antibodies and other features of the autoimmune
polyglandular syndrome (APS)); see sections on types I, II, and III APS,
pp.180-2).

Immunogenetics
• In DR4-positive patients DRB1*0404 is the most frequently carried
allele.
• The MICA-5.1 allele is an additional major independent determinant of
Addison’s disease.
• Polymorphisms in CTLA4 and the Class II transactivator (CIITA) have
been associated with autoimmune Addison’s disease.

ADDISON’S DISEASE

Immunopathology
• Lymphocytic inﬁltrate in the adrenal gland is conﬁned to the cortex
and comprises mainly activated CD4+ T cells, with some B cells and
CD8+ T cells.
• It has been suggested that Addison’s disease is a Th2 disease.

Autoantibodies
• Adrenocortical autoantibodies are found in two-thirds of patients.
• Autoantibodies are rarely found in normal individuals or in ﬁrst-degree
relatives. They may be found in small numbers of patients with other
autoimmune endocrine diseases (1.7% type diabetics)
• 21 hydroxylase (21OH; CYP21A2) has been identiﬁed as the major
autoantigen which is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum of zona
glomerulosa cells.
• 17 A-hydroxylase (CYP17), expressed in adrenal gland and gonads, and
P450scc (CYP11A1), expressed in adrenals, gonads, and placenta, can
also be the target of autoantibodies in autoimmune Addison’s disease.
• Autoantibodies are normally detected by indirect immunoﬂuorescence
on adrenal sections. This detects mainly antibodies to CYP21A and
CYP17.
Testing for Addison’s disease
Tests for diagnosis

Tests for monitoring

Endocrine function tests (basal cortisols,
short and long Synacthen® tests)

Endocrine function tests

Antibodies to adrenal, steroid-producing
cells, TPO, GPC

Monitor for development of
associated endocrinpathies and
B12 deﬁciency

Treatment
• Patients should be on long-term steroid replacement therapy and the
dose increased if the patient is unwell, undergoing surgery, etc.

Type I APS (autoimmune
polyendocrinopathy candidiasis
ectodermal dysplasia (APECED))
Presentation
• Presentation is usually during teenage years.
• First sign is often chronic Candida infection.
• This is generally followed by autoimmune hypoparathyroidism and
Addison’s disease.
• At least two of these three features should be present for diagnosis.
• Other autoimmune disease may be present:
• alopecia, vitiligo, chronic active hepatitis, hypogonadism, type
I diabetes, hypothyroidism, pernicious anaemia, intestinal
malabsorption, and autoimmune gastritis.
• It forms part of the spectrum of chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis
(see Chapter 1).

Immunopathogenesis and immunogenetics
• Type 1 APS is thought to be a Th2-type disease.
• There is no strong HLA linkage, although several reports have
suggested a link to HLA-A28.

TYPE II APS (SCHMIDT’S SYNDROME) AND TYPE III APS

• APS type 1 is the result of mutations of the recessive autosomal
autoimmune regulator element (AIRE) gene localized on chromosome
21q22.3 (autosomal recessive).
• Equal male and female incidence.
• Autoantibodies to 21OH, 17OH, and/or P450scc are found.
• Antibodies to tryptophan hydroxylase (an endogenous intestinal
antigen) have been described in patients with gastrointestinal
complications.
• Autoantibodies to interferon (particularly interferon-omega) have
been described.
• Other disease-speciﬁc autoantibodies will be found.
• AIRE gene.
• AIRE protein localizes in the nucleus and contains several motifs
found on proteins involved in transcriptional regulation.
• At least 50 different mutations of the AIRE gene have been
identiﬁed, with many of the APECED-causing mutations clustered
within the putative DNA binding and transactivation domains.
• AIRE is involved in the expression of a variety of peripheral tissue
antigens in the medullary thymus, a function that seems to be
required for purging the immune system of autoreactive T cells and
therefore the development of tolerance.
• The exact mechanism by which AIRE exerts its effect is yet to be
identiﬁed.

Type II APS (Schmidt’s syndrome)
and type III APS
Type II APS (Schmidt’s syndrome)
Presentation
• This comprises Addison’s disease + autoimmune thyroid disease
(Graves’ disease) ± IDDM.
• Pernicious anaemia, chronic active hepatitis, vitiligo, and hypogonadism
may also occur.
• Peak age of onset is 20-30 years of age.
• Females are more commonly affected than males (2:1).
Immunopathogenesis and immunogenetics
• It may be a Th1-type disease.
• Abnormal cellular immune function may occur.
• Autosomal dominant and recessive patterns of inheritance have been
identiﬁed.
• There is an association with HLA-B8, DR3, and certain subtypes
including DQA1*0501, DRB1*0301, and DQB1*0201.
• This syndrome is also associated with polymorphism of the MHC class
I chain-related A (MICA) gene.
Autoantibodies
The presence of antibodies to 17OH and P450scc is strongly associated
with a primary gonadic failure which often evolves into early menopause.

181

182

CHAPTER 4

Autoimmunity and the endocrine system

Type III APS
• This comprises autoimmune thyroid disease with either IDDM or
pernicious anaemia.
• Non-endocrine autoimmune disease may also occur, for example,
myasthenia gravis.
• Vitiligo and alopecia may also be present.
• There is a very strong female predominance and an association with
HLA-DR3.

IPEX syndrome
• IPEX syndrome (immune dysregulation, polyendocrinopathy,
enteropathy, X-linked)—see Chapter 1.
• Presentation is in infancy with enteropathy, IDDM, and thyroiditis.
• It is an X-linked condition.
• The gene defect (FOXP3) has been localized to Xp11.23-13.3.
• BMT/SCT has been used as a treatment.

Cushing’s syndrome
In Cushing’s syndrome due to pigmented nodular dysplasia, stimulating
IgG antibodies have been described which are thought possibly to bind to
the ACTH receptor, analogous to thyroid-stimulating antibodies.

Pernicious anaemia
Pernicious anaemia (PA) is the endstage of autoimmune gastritis which
typically affects persons aged >60 years.

Presentation
• Patients develop vitamin B12 deﬁciency and hence megaloblastic anaemia,
and in severe cases subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord.
• Patients often have prematurely grey hair and blue eyes.
• Increased risk of both gastric carcinoma and carcinoid tumours.
• Females are more commonly affected than males.
• More common in people with blood group A.

Immunogenetics
• No strong HLA association has been identiﬁed.
• Increased incidence in family members.
• Strong association with other endocrine autoimmune disease such as
autoimmune thyroiditis, IDDM, and adrenalitis.

Immunopathology
• Megaloblastic anaemia is the direct result of the vitamin B12 deﬁciency.
• Vitamin B12 deﬁciency is a consequence of the loss of intrinsic factor
producing gastric parietal cells in the corpus of the stomach afﬂicted
by autoimmune gastritis.

PERNICIOUS ANAEMIA

• Pathological lesion of autoimmune gastritis, also known as type A
chronic atrophic gastritis, is restricted to the parietal-cell-containing
corpus of the stomach, sparing the gastric antrum.
• Gastric lesion is characterized by chronic inﬂammatory (mainly
lymphocytic) inﬁltrate in the submucosa.
• Advanced lesions are characterized by intestinal metaplasia with
replacement of resident parietal and zymogenic cells of gastric glands
by mucus-secreting cells.
• Intrinsic factor antibody (IgA isotype) secreted on to the gastric lumen
by local lymphoid cells is likely to contribute to the deﬁciency of
intrinsic factor by complexing with intrinsic factor and preventing the
absorption of the intrinsic factor-vitamin B12 in the terminal ileum.
• Progression to overt pernicious anaemia may span 20-30 years.

Autoantibodies
• Gastric parietal cell (GPC) antibodies.
• GPC antibodies directed against the gastric H+/K+ ATPase are
diagnostic of the underlying pathological lesion of autoimmune
gastritis.
• Not diagnostic of pernicious anaemia as the gastric lesion may not
yet have progressed to this endstage condition.
• GPC antibodies are found in up to 85% of patients with PA.
• Also present on some patients with other autoimmune
endocrinopathies and in 3-10% of healthy individuals (increasing
incidence with age).
• Antibodies to parietal cells directed towards the gastric ATPase
have been reported in about 20-30% of patients with H.pyloriassociated gastritis.
• it is hypothesized that H.pylori may be the environmental trigger for
autoimmune gastritis.
• GPC antibodies may also arise, with the appearance of thyroid
antibodies, during treatment of hepatitis C infection with
A-interferon.
• Intrinsic factor antibodies:
• Intrinsic factor antibodies have a much higher disease speciﬁcity,
but lower sensitivity, than GPC antibodies.
• Intrinsic factor antibodies are found in approximately 60% of
patients with PA.
• Two types of intrinsic factor antibodies have been described.
• Type 1 antibodies bind to the vitamin B12 binding site of
intrinsic factor while type 2 bind to a site remote from this and
block uptake in the terminal ileum.

Treatment
• No immunotherapeutic manoeuvres are used.
• Patients who have vitamin B12 deﬁciency should be given replacement
intramuscular vitamin B12 (given initially in high doses with
supplemental potassium, having checked that other haematinics,
especially iron, are adequate and then 3 monthly).

183

184

CHAPTER 4

Autoimmunity and the endocrine system

• Erroneous treatment of patients with folic acid may not only mask
the anaemia caused by vitamin B12 deﬁciency but can permit the
development of irreversible neurological damage.
• Asymptomatic GPC antibody positive patients with normal MCV and
B12 should be monitored annually for development of B12 deﬁciency,
especially if other family members have PA.
• GPC antibody positive patients should be screened for autoimmune
thyroid disease.

Premature ovarian failure, gonadal
autoimmunity, and immunological
infertility
Premature ovarian failure
Presentation
• Affects 1% of women (deﬁned as a menopause <40 years of age).
• 20% of these are associated with Addison’s disease, but the remainder
are not associated with APS.
Autoantibodies
• Ovarian, adrenal, and steroid cell antibodies may be detected in
patients.
• Steroid cell antibodies are directed at 17A-hydroxylase and P450 sidechain-cleavage enzyme.
• Another target enzyme appears to be 3B-hydroxysteroid
dehydrogenase, which may be a more sensitive and speciﬁc marker of
premature ovarian failure.
• Antibodies have been described against the follicle-stimulating hormone
(FSH) receptor and other unidentiﬁed surface receptors in premature
ovarian failure, although this still appears to be controversial.
• Screening of patients with premature ovarian failure should include
a search for ovarian-, adrenal-, and steroid-cell antibodies by indirect
immunoﬂuorescence.

PITUITARY AUTOIMMUNITY

Gonadal autoantibodies
• Found in patients with Addison’s disease and hypogonadism.
• React with steroid-producing cells of the adrenal cortex,
syncytiotrophoblasts, Leydig cells of the testis, and the theca interna/
granulosa cell layer of the ovary.
• Associated with type I APS.
• The target antigens are 17A-hydroxylase (CYP17) and P450 side-chaincleavage enzyme (CYP11A1).
• Steroid-cell antibodies are found in 15% of Addison’s patients without
hypogonadism, but in >80% with hypogonadism.
• They rarely disappear and infertility is usually lifelong.

Immunological infertility
• Infertile women may have anti-oocyte antibodies (approximately 9%
of patients) which inhibit adherence and penetration of spermatozoa
through the zona pellucida.
• ZP3, the primary sperm receptor, has been identiﬁed as a target
antigen in an experimental mouse system.
• Antibodies against spermatozoa, causing agglutination or
immobilization, have also been described.
• It is not now thought that these antibodies play a major role in the
genesis of the infertility, as they may also be detected in 12% of fertile
women.

Pituitary autoimmunity
Autoimmune hypophysitis (lymphocytic hypophysitis) is very rare and
is characterized by a lymphocytic inﬁltration. Both the anterior and the
posterior pituitary may be involved, leading to endocrine dysfunction and
diabetes insipidus. The gland and stalk may appear swollen on MRI.
• Anterior hypophysitis may be associated with type I (APS).
• Target antigens are unknown at present, but a possible target is the
prolactin-secreting cell.
• Antibodies may also be detected against vasopressin-producing cells,
associated with autoimmune diabetes insipidus.
• A lymphocytic hypophysitis associated with pituitary failure has
been found in young women during or after pregnancy. This may be
associated with pituitary-reactive autoantibodies.
• Care needs to be taken to exclude a rare presentation of Wegener’s
granulomatosis.
• Pituitary antibodies may also be found in some patients with Sheehan’s
syndrome (pituitary infarction).
• Treatment with immunosuppressive drugs (corticosteroids,
azathioprine) has been used.

185

186

CHAPTER 4

Autoimmunity and the endocrine system

Parathyroid autoimmunity
• Antibodies may be detected which recognize parathyroid gland surface
membrane antigens and may inhibit parathyroid hormone (PTH)
secretion in vitro.
• They recognize the external domain of the calcium-sensing receptor
and are associated with CMC and APS.
• Antibodies to mitochondria of parathyroid chief cells have been
described.
• Blocking antibodies to the PTH receptor have been described in
secondary hyperparathyroidism of renal failure.
• Detection is by immunoﬂuorescence on parathyroid sections, but
normal mitochondrial and antinuclear antibodies must be excluded
ﬁrst using a standard multiblock slide, as these will interfere with the
detection of parathyroid antibodies.

Vitiligo and alopecia
Vitiligo
• Vitiligo is due to melanocyte loss and occurs in isolation or in
association with other autoimmune diseases, typically thyrogastric
autoimmunity and type II APS.
• It can also occur in association with inﬂammatory diseases.
• Multiple susceptibility gene loci have been identiﬁed, including PTPN22
(generalized vitiligo), IL-2RA, and MHC Class I and Class II (DRB1,
DQA1). Mutations (SNPs) have been identiﬁed in the NALP1 gene.
• High levels of IL-1β expression are found.
• Target antigen of the immune response is tyrosinase and antibodies
are present in most patients.
• This enzyme is an important target antigen in melanoma, and patients
with vitiligo and melanoma who have detectable antibodies do better
than those without.
• Anti-tyrosinase antibodies are only found in patients with type II APS,
but not type I APS or sporadic vitiligo.
• Speciﬁc treatment is rarely successful: topical tacrolimus and UVA or
UVB therapy may be tried.

Alopecia
• Alopecia frequently accompanies autoimmune diseases, especially
thyroid, vitiligo, and SLE.
• There is no conclusive evidence for autoantibodies to the hair follicles,
although this would not preclude a T-cell-mediated disease process.

CHAPTER 5

Autoimmunity of the nervous system

Myasthenia gravis (MG)
Presentation
• Patients complain of double vision, muscle weakness, and fatigue
(worse later in the day).
• Ptosis and diplopia are typical signs.
• Examination reveals generalized fatiguable muscle weakness.
• It is a heterogeneous condition with varying ages of presentation.
• Diagnosis of a neuromuscular junction defect can be conﬁrmed by
electrophysiological tests and the Tensilon® test (see Box 5.1).

Box 5.1 Testing for myasthenia gravis
Tests for diagnosis

Test for monitoring

Tensilon (edrophonium) test

AchRAb

AchRAb
Striated muscle antibodies
MuSK antibodies

Immunogenetics
• In younger patients there is an association with HLA-A1, B8, and DR3,
and a strong female predominance.
• Disease can also be induced by penicillamine, and is mostly found in
those who are HLA-Bw35/DR1 positive.

Immunopathology
• Muscle weakness is due to impaired action of acetylcholine (ACh) at
the muscle endplate.
• The cause is unknown but the disease is strongly associated with
thymomas (benign and malignant), thymic hyperplasia, and other
autoimmune diseases such as SLE, polymyositis, haemolytic anaemia,
and thyroid disease (especially in those <40 years old).
• Prevalence is 2-10/100 000.
• Patients with thymoma are usually older and both sexes are affected
equally; about 10% have thymomas, but removal of the tumour does
not always affect the course of the disease.

Autoantibodies
•
•
•
•

IgG anti-ACh-receptor (AChRAb) is detected in 75-95% of patients.
10% are seronegative.
50% with pure ocular myasthenia are seronegative.
The disease is caused by direct receptor blockade, complementmediated endplate damage, and enhanced recycling of the receptor off
the endplate surface membrane.
• AChRAb levels are variable, but high titres are found in those <40
years old with thymic hyperplasia.

LAMBERT-EATON MYASTHENIC SYNDROME (LEMS)

• Antibodies are IgG isotype and therefore can be transmitted across
the placenta, causing neonatal myasthenia.
• The presence of striated muscle antibodies is a marker for the
presence of a thymoma. These includes antibodies to the ryanodine
receptor and titin antibodies.
• Cardiac arrythmias may occur in the presence of anti-cardiac muscle
antibodies.
• Antibodies to MuSK (muscle-speciﬁc tyrosine kinase) have been shown
in a proportion of patients with AChRAb negative MG.
• MuSK is a receptor tyrosine kinase that is restricted to the
neuromuscular junction.
• Patients with these antibodies are typically female, with bulbar
disease, who may be difﬁcult to treat with immunosuppression.
• Antibodies to MuSK interfere with agrin-triggered stimulation of
MuSK.

Treatment
• Treatment is with oral anti-cholinesterases.
• Immunosuppressive therapy may be required: prednisolone (1-1.5mg/
kg) alone or with azathioprine is the treatment of choice.
• Mycophenolate mofetil, cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and
ciclosporin have all been used.
• Thymectomy may be required to prevent local extension and exclude
malignancy.
• Plasma exchange may be helpful in myasthenic crisis, but must be
coupled with other immunosuppressive therapy.
• High-dose IVIg (hdIVIg) has also been demonstrated to be helpful in
acute crises.

Lambert-Eaton myasthenic
syndrome (LEMS)
Presentation
• LEMS is an idiopathic or paraneoplastic syndrome.
• It is associated with small cell lung cancer (SCLC) as a paraneoplastic
phenomenon (1-3% of cases).
• Some cases occur without cancer (especially in children) and are
associated with HLA-B8, DR3.
• Proximal muscle weakness is marked, but bulbar and ocular muscles
are spared.
• Associated with other autoimmune diseases, especially thyroid and
vitiligo.

Immunopathology
• There is a decrease of voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCC) on
presynaptic nerve terminals caused by an autoantibody reactive with
the channels, particularly the P/Q-type.
• Some patients have antibodies to synaptotagmin.

189

190

CHAPTER 5

Autoimmunity of the nervous system

• Patients with LEMS may also have antibodies to AchR.
• Autoimmune aetiology has been established by demonstration of
passive transfer of disease.

Treatment
• Treatment of the tumour with chemotherapy may give temporary
beneﬁt.
• 3,4-diaminopyridine (blocks potassium channels) or guanidine may be
needed to control the weakness.
• Plasma exchange or hdIVIg may be of signiﬁcant (but temporary)
beneﬁt.
• In both non- and paraneoplastic forms, prednisolone is an option
combined with azathioprine in non-paraneoplastic LEMS.

Acquired neuromyotonia
(Isaac’s disease) and stiff person
syndrome (SPS)
Acquired neuromyotonia (Isaac’s disease)
Presentation
• This syndrome is marked by acquired spontaneous and continuous
muscle contraction.
• Patients develop stiffness, twitching, cramps, sweating, and other
autonomic problems.
Immunopathology
• Some cases are due to autoantibodies against voltage-gated potassium
channels (VGKC) at presynaptic nerve terminals.
Treatment
• Treated with phenytoin, carbamazepine, or immunosuppression.

Stiff person syndrome
Presentation
• It causes a ﬂuctuating and progressive muscular rigidity, which is
painful.
• Men are more commonly affected than women.
• Up to a third of patients will develop diabetes, and there may be
features of autoimmune glandular disease.
• In approximately 10% of patients, SPS develops as a paraneoplastic
disorder associated with breast cancer.
Immunopathology
• This rare neurological syndrome is associated with anti-GAD
antibodies.
• The ﬁnding of the autoantibody ties in with the neurological
conclusion that GABAergic neurons, which regulate muscle tone, are
involved.

PANDAS

Autoantibodies
• Anti-GAD antibodies are found in >60% of patients with SPS (see
Chapter 18).
• Anti-amphiphysin antibodies are sometimes elevated in blood and CSF
of patients with paraneoplastic SPS and, rarely, in non-neoplastic SPS.
• There is some evidence that the autoantibodies are pathogenic in
some cases of paraneoplastic SPS.
Treatment
• Muscle relaxants such as diazepam, baclofen, vigabatrin, and valproate
are used.
• HdIVIg has been shown to be effective in a single trial in nonparaneoplastic SPS.
• Immunosuppression is frequently attempted.
• There are case reports of complete remission with rituximab
(anti-CD20).

Morvan’s syndrome
• Rare syndrome of neuromyotonia, hyperhidrosis, insomnia, and
delirium.
• Autoimmune aetiology; may be associated with thymoma (and solid
tumours).
• Associated with antibodies to VGKC and to CASPR2
• May respond to corticosteroids, plasmapheresis, hdIVIg, and
thymectomy.

Rasmussen encephalitis
• This rare syndrome usually presents in children, with hemiparesis and
intractable focal epilepsy, dementia, and cerebral atrophy.
• In some cases associated with autoantibodies to glutamate R3
receptors and the synaptic protein munc-18. A subset is associated
with antibodies to the NMDA receptor.
• It may respond to hdIVIg.

PANDAS
PANDAS—paediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated
with Streptococcus).
• Syndrome with dramatic onset of symptoms including motor and vocal
tics. Possibly similar to Sydenham’s chorea, but no evidence of cardiac
involvement. Basal ganglia affected.
• May be a genetic susceptibility to this syndrome after group A
streptococcal infection linked to expression of B-cell antigen D8/17.
• May respond to hdIVIg.

191

192

CHAPTER 5

Autoimmunity of the nervous system

Paraneoplastic autoimmune
neurological syndromes
Paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration
• Associated with carcinoma of the breast and carcinoma of the ovary.
• Anti-Yo antibodies, directed against the cytoplasm of cerebellar
Purkinje cells and recognizing two antigens of molecular weights 34
and 62kDa, are found.
• Associated with Hodgkin’s lymphoma:
• anti-Tr antibodies
• anti mGluR1.
• Associated with SCLC, without LEMS:
• antibodies to P/Q VGCC
• anti-PCA2 (also causes encephalomyelitis)
• Zic4 (often in association with anti-Hu and anti-CV2/CRMP5).
• Associated with germ cell tumours, breast and colon cancer:
• antibodies to Ma.
• May be treated with immunosuppression, tumour removal, and hdIVIg.

Paraneoplastic neurological syndrome of ataxia and
myoclonus (opsoclonus-myoclonus)
• This has been described in patients with carcinoma of the breast,
gynaecological cancer, and SCLC.
• Patients may have anti-Yo or an anti-neuronal nuclear antibody,
anti-Ri.
• Can be treated with immunosuppression, tumour removal, and
hdIVIg.

Paraneoplastic ataxic sensory neuropathy or paraneoplastic
encephalomyelitis
• This can occur in patients with small cell carcinoma of the lung,
although less commonly patients may have anaplastic, bronchial, or
squamous carcinoma of the lung, or reticuloendothelial neoplasms.
• Anti-Hu is an anti-neuronal nuclear antibody (ANNA), recognizing a
group of proteins of molecular weight 35-40kDa.
• Anti-Hu is one of the autoantibodies now known to penetrate intact
cells containing the Hu antigen in their nucleus, indicating that it may
have a primary pathogenic role.
• Other antibodies associated with paraneoplastic encephalomyelitis
include anti-Zic and anti-Ma (brainstem encephalitis).
• Paraneoplastic tranverse myelitis with SCLC is associated with anti-Hu,
anti-CV2/CRMP5, or anti-amphiphysin antibodies.
• Paraneoplastic autonomic neuropathy is associated with anti-Hu,
anti-CV2/CRMP5, and antibodies to ganglionic AChR.
• Many other target antigens have been identiﬁed, but they occur
extremely rarely.

DEMYELINATING DISEASES 1

Demyelinating diseases 1: multiple
sclerosis (MS)
Clinical presentation
• The pattern of illness is difﬁcult to predict; it may be chronic and
progressive, or relapsing and remitting.
• The progressive form of the disease leads to disability.
• It affects any age, but predominantly the young, and has a 2:1 female
predominance.
• Clinical presentations are highly variable and include visual disturbance
(optic neuritis), ataxia, weakness, and sensory signs, which usually
resolve completely over a few days, at least in initial attacks.

Immunogenetics
• MHC susceptibility loci have been identiﬁed, although these differ in
different racial groups.
• DR2, DQ1, and DQ6 seem to be particularly important; DRB1*1501 is
the strongest HLA association.
• Other genetic susceptibility loci are located on chromosomal regions
19q35 and 17q13.
• Monozygotic twin concordance is only 25-30%.

Immunopathology
• The cause of MS is unknown, although there are strong indications that
it is triggered by infection.
• the disease seems to involve abnormal T cells reactive to myelin basic
protein.
• Macrophages and microglia are involved, with local release of
inﬂammatory cytokines and upregulation of MHC class II antigens.
• Plasma cells also localize to lesions, increasing local synthesis of IgG.
• There is selective destruction of myelin sheath and demyelination.
• Animal studies show that the disease can be transferred with CD4+ T
cells.
• CSF may contain membrane attack complexes of complement.
• Cytokines may be involved (TNF, IFNs, and IL-2).

Autoantibodies
• Autoantibodies to myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) may
occur.
• Some patients with a typical MS pattern of demyelination may
demonstrate anti-nuclear antibodies and antibodies to dsDNA,
without other features of SLE.
• Conversely, some patients who clearly have SLE develop MS-like
symptoms and signs.

Investigations
• There are no speciﬁc diagnostic immunological tests.
• Examination of serum and CSF demonstrates increased intrathecal
immunoglobulin synthesis, with a CSF IgG-to-albumin ratio >22%.

193

194

CHAPTER 5

Autoimmunity of the nervous system

• Isoelectric focusing and immunoblotting demonstrate the presence of
oligoclonal IgG bands, but these are not speciﬁc for MS, as they are
also found in neurosarcoid, neurosyphilis, acute viral infections of the
CNS, SLE, and Sjögren’s syndrome.
• Other helpful tests include evoked potentials (visual, auditory, peripheral).
• MRI scanning shows typically placed demyelinating lesions.
• Rarely, patients with MS develop a uveitis as well as an optic neuritis.
This may be associated with autoantibodies to the retinal S-antigen.

Treatment
• Acute attacks may respond to high-dose steroids, but chronic steroid
therapy does not prevent relapses.
• Cytotoxic agents mitoxantrone, cladribine, azathioprine, and
cyclophosphamide have also shown some beneﬁt.
• β-interferon (1a and 1b) (8mU on alternate days subcutaneously)
has shown considerable promise in decreasing the relapse rate in the
relapsing-remitting form. Utility of therapy may be limited by antiinterferon antibodies.
• Drugs have signiﬁcant immunomodulatory effects, including
reducing T-cell proliferation, decreasing induced MHC class II
antigen expression, and reducing the production of inﬂammatory
cytokines (TNF-α and γ-IFN).
• The effect can be monitored by measuring the production of
myxoma resistance protein A (MxA).
• Natalizumab (Tysabri®) is an MAb against α4-integrin, and has been
shown to be useful in MS. Concerns have been raised about possible
association with progressive multifocal leucoencephalopathy (PML).
• Other biologicals in trial include daclizumab (anti-IL-2R), rituximab
(anti-CD20), and alemtuzumab (anti-CD52).
• Glatiramer is an immunomodulatory drug comprising synthetic
polypeptides. It also reduces attack rate in relapsing-remitting disease.
• Fingolimod is a sphingosine analogue that modulates the sphingosine-1phosphate receptor and alters lymphocyte migration. Beneﬁt has been
identiﬁed; possibly best for newly diagnosed patients.
• Fumarate (also used in skin disease) has been shown to reduce new
lesions.
• Evidence for the use of hdIVIg is sparse.
• TNFα blockade is not helpful.

Demyelinating diseases 2: Guillain-
Barré syndrome (GBS) and variants
Clinical presentation
• An inﬂammatory demyelinating peripheral neuropathy that frequently
follows 1-3 weeks after infection, particularly with Campylobacter jejuni.

DEMYELINATING DISEASES 3

• Begins with ascending weakness, which may progress with alarming
rapidity and involve bulbar and respiratory muscles, including the
diaphragm, leading to respiratory failure.
• Sensory symptoms are mild.
• There may be marked autonomic instability.
• Demyelination may progress for up to 4 weeks before remyelination
begins.
• Recovery may be very prolonged.
• There are a number of variants to this classical presentation and
progression, including acute motor axonal neuropathy, acute motor
sensory axonal neuropathy, and the Miller Fisher variant with
ophthalmoplegia, ataxia, and areﬂexia.

Immunopathology and autoantibodies
• Antibodies to membrane gangliosides (glycolipids including GM1, LM1,
and GD1b) are detected in sera from up to 40% of patients with GBS.
• These antibodies interfere with nerve conduction and have been
shown to activate phagocytes via IgG receptors.
• Antibodies to GQ1b are present in 90-100% of cases of the Miller
Fisher variant and seem to be speciﬁc for this condition, possibly
related to the very high expression of this antigen in the third cranial
nerve.
• Anti-GM1 antibodies are known to cross-react with
lipopolysaccharides from C.jejuni.

Treatment
• Treatment is best undertaken with plasmapheresis or hdIVIg, which
appear to be equally effective if begun early.
• There is a suggestion that the relapse rate may be higher with hdIVIg.
• Steroids are of no beneﬁt, and may make symptoms worse.
• The Miller Fisher variant appears to be relatively benign and resolves
without treatment.

Demyelinating diseases 3: chronic
inﬂammatory demyelinating
polyneuropathy (CIDP), related
conditions, and Devic’s syndrome
(neuromyelitis optica)
Chronic inﬂammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP)
Clinical features
• CIDP resembles a chronic form of GBS.
• Characterized by mainly distal weakness and areﬂexia as well as
marked sensory signs.
• There is usually no history of antecedent infection.

195

196

CHAPTER 5

Autoimmunity of the nervous system

Investigations
• The diagnosis is conﬁrmed by the course, exclusion of other diseases,
and typical electrophysiological studies compatible with demyelination.
• Complement-ﬁxing IgG and IgM antibodies may be demonstrated in
affected nerves.
• Autoantibodies to the gangliosides GM1, LM1, and GD1b can be found
in some patients.
Treatment
• Steroids, cytotoxic agents, plasmapheresis, and hdIVIg have all been
used successfully.
• If hdIVIG is to be given, current practice is to give three courses at
monthly intervals and a further three courses if there is beneﬁt.
• Treatment is then discontinued, to see whether patients maintain
remission.
• Some patients require long-term hdIVIg therapy.

Related conditions
• Other related conditions that may have an autoimmune basis include
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and multifocal motor neuropathy with
conduction block.
• Multifocal motor neuropathy with conduction block is associated
with high-titre polyclonal antibodies to GM1. Plasma exchange may
not be effective.
• Treatment is the same as for CIDP.

Devic’s syndrome (neuromyelitis optica)
• Comprises attacks of optic neuritis and myelitis but, unlike MS, there is
no brainstem, cerebellar, or cognitive involvement.
• Seen mainly in Asians and Africans, but not Caucasians.
• May be associated with SLE, Sjögren’s syndrome, P-ANCA+ vasculitis,
or mixed connective tissue disease.
• Can be triggered by varicella or HIV infection.
• Autoantibodies to aquaporin 4 (channel for water transport in
astrocytes) are frequently found and are diagnostic.
• Demyelination is complement-mediated and therefore distinct from MS.

Demyelinating diseases 4:
paraproteinaemic neuropathy and
paraproteinaemic myopathy
Paraproteinaemic neuropathy
• Demyelinating polyneuropathies may be associated with paraproteins
of all classes.
• Anti-myelin-associated glycoprotein neuropathy is particularly
associated with IgM paraproteins directed against myelin-associated

VASCULITIC NEUROPATHY AND DEGOS’S DISEASE

glycoprotein (MAG), a 100kDa glycoprotein of central and peripheral
nerves.
• The light chain of the monoclonal protein is invariably lambda.
• Paraproteinaemic neuropathies may be associated with:
• Waldenström’s macroglobulinaemia.
• amyloidosis (see Chapter 14, p.338).
• type II cryoglobulinaemia.
• POEMS syndrome (polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy,
monoclonal gammopathy, and skin changes) (see also Chapter 4).
• Skin changes tend to be a sclerodermatous thickening.
• Endocrine diseases include diabetes, thyroid disease, gonadal failure,
and hyperprolactinaemia.
• Lymph nodes may show the changes of Castleman’s syndrome, or
angiofollicular lymph node hyperplasia (with ‘onion-skin’ lesions),
which is itself also associated with a polyneuropathy. The lesion is
not thought to be malignant.
• IL-6 levels are said to be raised, explaining the plasma-cell
abnormalities.
• CIDP associated with MGUS: a monoclonal gammopathy of uncertain
signiﬁcance will be found in approximately 10% of patients for whom
no diagnosis has been identiﬁed.
• A severe motor and sensory polyneuropathy is seen in up to 50%
of patients with osteosclerotic myeloma and can be the presenting
feature of the illness.
Treatment
• Treatment of paraproteinaemic neuropathies should include treatment
of the underlying plasma-cell clone with steroids, melphalan, or
chlorambucil.
• Plasmapheresis and hdIVIg are useful as for CIDP.

Paraproteinaemic myopathy
Anti-decorin (BJ) antibodies have been associated with myopathy associated
with Waldenström’s macroglobulinaemia (speciﬁcity of the paraprotein).

Vasculitic neuropathy and Degos’s
disease
Vasculitic neuropathy
Systemic causes
• Behçet’s disease
• Giant cell arteritis (GCA)
• Takayasu’s arteritis
• Wegener’s granulomatosis
• Churg-Strauss syndrome
• Cogan’s syndrome
• Kawasaki’s disease
• Henoch-Schönlein purpura in children

197

198

CHAPTER 5

Autoimmunity of the nervous system

• Polyarteritis nodosa
• Systemic lupus erythematosus
• Rheumatoid arthritis
Clinical features
• Clinical deﬁcits arise from nerve ischaemia or infarction.
• Patients may present with a variety of symptoms including
mononeuritis multiplex, asymmetric neuropathy, and a distal
polyneuropathy.
Investigations
• Nerve biopsy shows a vasculitis of the epineurial arterioles, focal
or multifocal ﬁbre loss, and areas of segmental demyelination and
remyelination.
• Investigation should follow the guidance in Chapter 13.
Treatment
• Steroids are the mainstay of treatment with or without the addition of
cytotoxics.
• Cyclophosphamide appears to be the most effective treatment.

Degos’s disease
See Chapter 13.
• A vasculitic syndrome in which cerebral infarction is a major feature.
• Associated with the presence of anti-cardiolipin antibodies and a lupus
anticoagulant.
• Activated T cells (virally triggered) may be the pathogenic mechanism.

Neuropathy associated with Sjögren’s
syndrome (SS)
Clinical features
Patients may present with a number of neurological conditions:
• chronic and slowly progressive sensorimotor neuropathy
• sensory neuropathy
• neuronopathy
• mononeuritis multiplex
• multiple recurrent cranial neuropathies
• subacute demyelinating polyradiculopathy.

Autoantibodies
• An IgG antibody can be detected against Ro and La in approximately
50% of patients.
• See Chapter 12 for details of investigation of suspected SS.

Treatment
• Response to treatments has generally been disappointing.
• Steroids, immunosuppression, plasma exchange, and hdIVIG have all
been used.

PRIMARY ANGIITIS OF THE CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM (PACNS)

Autoimmune encephalopathies
Encephalopathies have been associated with the following.
• Sjögren’s syndrome: this is not well-established.
• Hashimoto’s thyroiditis with high levels of anti-thyroid antibodies.
• α-enolase has been identiﬁed as an auto-antigen in this syndrome
• Treatment is with corticosteroids and hdIVIg.
• Coeliac disease in association with occipital lobe epilepsy and
intracranial calciﬁcation has been described. Seizure control may
improve with a strict gluten-free diet.
• Coeliac disease may also be associated with a cerebellar syndrome
which may respond to gluten withdrawal.
• Claims have been made that this syndrome is associated with
IgG antigliadin rather than endomysial or tissue transglutaminase
antibodies. Evidence is weak
• Synapsin I has been identiﬁed as a possible target of cross-reactive
antigliadin antibodies.

CHAPTER 6

Autoimmunity

Cardiac disease 1: myocarditis and
cardiomyopathy
Myocarditis
• This is associated with connective tissue diseases, especially SLE, and
vasculitis, particularly Churg-Strauss syndrome.
• May present with congestive heart failure, arrhythmias, and chest pain.
• There appears to be an association with anti-ribonucleoprotein (antiRNP) antibodies.
• There is usually good response to steroids.

Cardiomyopathy
• Anti-cardiac antibodies are associated with dilated cardiomyopathy,
which may also have features of myocarditis on biopsy.
• Anti-cardiac antibodies are also found in 20% of cases of type II
autoimmune polyglandular syndrome, but in this syndrome they are
not associated with cardiomyopathy but with an increase in blood
pressure.
• Antibodies are directed against cardiac atrial cells producing atrial
natriuretic peptide.
• Dilated cardiomyopathy is associated with M7 anti-mitochondrial
antibodies recognizing mitochondrial ﬂavoproteins, including riboﬂavin.

Cardiac disease 2: eosinophilic
syndromes
• Rare eosinophilic syndromes may affect the myocardium, eventually
leading to endomyocardial ﬁbrosis.
• Churg-Strauss syndrome frequently involves the myocardium—check
ANCA and IgE.
• Idiopathic eosinophilic syndromes may affect heart.
• Echocardiography is required.

Cardiac disease 3: recurrent pericarditis
and Dressler’s syndrome
Recurrent pericarditis
• May occur as a disease in its own right, although it is a common
feature of connective tissue diseases including:
• SLE and rheumatoid arthritis (RhA)
• autoinﬂammatory diseases, e.g. familial Mediterranean fever (see
Chapter 14, p.342).
• The pericardium is thickened, with an inﬁltrate of inﬂammatory cells.
• No speciﬁc immunological tests.

CARDIAC DISEASE 4: RHEUMATIC FEVER

• NSAIDs are the ﬁrst line of treatment. Steroids may be required, and
colchicine has been suggested as a useful agent.
• Pericardectomy may be required.

Dressler’s syndrome
• This is (myo-)pericarditis occurring 2-3 weeks after a myocardial
infarction and presenting with typical pericarditic pain.
• It is very rare since thrombolytic therapy has been introduced.
• Antibodies to cardiac muscle are often present.
• Post-pericardotomy syndrome is similar but follows cardiac surgery.
• NSAIDs and steroids may be required but the syndromes settle
spontaneously.

Cardiac disease 4: rheumatic fever
Clinical features
• Incidence is now increasing.
• Mainly affects children but can be seen in adults.
• Clinical features include carditis, polyarthritis, chorea, cutaneous
nodules, erythema marginatum, prolonged PR interval on ECG, and
raised CRP/ESR, together with evidence of previous streptococcal
infection with group A streptococci.

Immunopathology
• Appears to be due to an aberrant immunological response to the
streptococcal M-proteins (M-proteins 5, 14, 24), some of which
generate antibodies that are cross-reactive with human sarcolemmal
proteins and myosin.
• Other streptococcal M-proteins cause cross-reactive antibodies
reacting with the vimentin of glomerular mesangial cells, and therefore
are associated with glomerulonephritis.
• M-protein types 1, 5, and 18 cross-react with cartilage epitopes, thus
potentially leading to arthritis.
• In addition, the M-proteins may act as bacterial superantigens,
enhancing the autodestructive immune response.

Diagnosis
• There are no speciﬁc immunological tests.
• Diagnosis is clinical, supported by ECG, elevated acute-phase proteins,
and raised antistreptolysin O titre (ASOT).

Treatment
•
•
•
•

Antibiotics to eliminate the organism.
NSAIDs for arthralgia.
Corticosteroids for carditis.
Long-term penicillin prophylaxis is required as the syndrome will recur
on subsequent group A streptococcal infection.

204

CHAPTER 6

Autoimmunity

Respiratory disease 1: idiopathic
pulmonary ﬁbrosis (cryptogenic
ﬁbrosing alveolitis)
Clinical features
• Patients present with severe progressive breathlessness. A fulminant
presentation, often with fever and cough, is referred to as the
Hamman-Rich syndrome.
• Inﬂammatory lung ﬁbrosis may occur in association with connective
tissue diseases (SLE, Sjögren’s syndrome, antisynthetase syndrome)
and as a consequence of drug exposure, especially nitrofurantoin.
• Many cases have no obvious trigger or association.

Immunopathogenesis
• Biopsies show activated macrophages and a neutrophil inﬁltrate.
• In the early stages there is a lymphoid inﬁltrate (before ﬁbrosis
develops), and excess local cytokine production can be demonstrated
(TNFA, IL-2, G-IFN, TGF-B, IL-8).

Investigations
• Lung function shows a reduced forced vital capacity (FVC) and
diffusion capacity, with desaturation on exercise.
• BAL may be helpful as part of the diagnostic work-up (see Part 2),
particularly where there is a lymphocytosis.
• Biopsy (transbronchial or trans-thoracic) may be required.
• Chest X-ray (CXR) and lung CT demonstrate typical interstitial
ﬁbrosis.
• Most patients show an acute-phase response with a polyclonal
hypergammaglobulinaemia.
• RhF is found in 50% and ANA in 20%.

Treatment
• Treatment is with steroids, with either azathioprine or
cyclophosphamide, but the response is often poor and the disease is
progressive.

Respiratory disease 2: pulmonary
alveolar proteinosis (PAP)
Clinical features
• May be congenital or acquired (silicosis, immunodeﬁeincy, malignancy).
• Gradual onset of exertional dyspnoea, fever, fatigue and weight loss.

Immunopathogenesis
• Congenital PAP is an autosomal recessive disease caused by mutations
in the surfactant protein B (SP-B) gene.

RESPIRATORY DISEASE 4: EOSINOPHILIC LUNG SYNDROMES

Investigations
• Associated with polyclonal hypergammaglobulinaemia (unless
secondary to immune deﬁciency).

Respiratory disease 3: lymphoid
interstitial pneumonitis and sarcoidosis
Lymphoid interstitial pneumonitis
Clinical features
• Patients present with chronic cough, shortness of breath, and chest
pain.
• May occur alone, but is more usually found in autoimmune diseases,
such as Sjögren’s syndrome, SLE, dermatomyositis, and polymyositis,
and in association with drugs.
• Also associated with viral infection (particularly HIV, EBV), and
common variable immunodeﬁciency.
Investigations
• Biopsy and BAL are the most helpful tests.
• There is a lymphocytic alveolitis (CD8+ T cells in HIV and CD4+ T cells
in Sjögren’s syndrome).
• Hypergammaglobulinaemia is usually found, but in any case is
associated with the primary disorders (with the exception of CVID).
Treatment
• Corticosteroids and immunosuppressive drugs (cyclophosphamide and
azathioprine) may be used.
• Treatment of underlying infection, where present.

Sarcoidosis
• See Chapter 14.
• Although not normally considered an autoimmune disease, some
patients with histologically proven sarcoidosis have anti-nuclear and
dsDNA antibodies.

Respiratory disease 4: eosinophilic
lung syndromes
The lung is affected by a variety of hypereosinophilic syndromes:
• Löefﬂer’s syndrome (a hypersensivity reaction to drugs or parasites, or
idiopathic)
• chronic eosinophilic pneumonia
• tropical pulmonary eosinophilia (due to ﬁlariasis)
• Churg-Strauss syndrome (eosinophilic vasculitis—often associated
with neuropathy) (see Chapter 13)
• eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome (contaminated l-tryptophan)

205

206

CHAPTER 6

Autoimmunity

• bronchopulmonary aspergillosis
• eosinophilic granuloma (Langerhans cell histiocytosis).
Investigations
• Investigations which may help distinguish the cause, other than
standard respiratory investigations (CXR, RFTs, CT), include:
• BAL, with lymphocyte subpopulation analysis—if Langerhans cell
histiocytosis is suspected, then antibodies to the S-100 antigen
should be included in the panel
• biopsy
• ANCA (including MPO and PR3 antibodies)
• IgE and speciﬁc IgE (Aspergillus)
• Aspergillus precipitins
• identiﬁcation of parasitic infection (direct identiﬁcation, serology).
• Eosinophil cationic protein (ECP).
• The role of serum ECP levels is uncertain, as it is likely to be raised
whatever the cause of eosinophil activation.
• However, it may have a role in monitoring the response to
treatment and be a more sensitive marker of damaging activity than
eosinophil number in the peripheral blood.
Treatment
• Treatment is usually with steroids, once an underlying infective trigger
has been excluded.
• Churg-Strauss syndrome usually requires additional cytotoxic therapy.

Respiratory disease 5: other respiratory
diseases
Various aspects of respiratory disease are covered in other chapters
(Chapter 3, ‘Allergic disease’, Chapter 13, ‘Vasculitis’, and Chapter 14,
‘Miscellaneous syndromes’). Goodpasture’s syndrome is covered in this
chapter (p.210).
A useful website is the British Thoracic Society (www.brit-thoracic.org.uk).

Renal disease 1:
glomerulonephritis—an overview
The diagnosis of glomerulonephritis is complex and specialized. It relies
on the synthesis of multiple diagnostic strands, including routine histology,
immunoﬂuorescence on biopsies, electron microscopy (EM), and serological tests. All the histology should be done in the same laboratory and
reported by the same person; it is inappropriate for immunology laboratories to do the direct immunoﬂuorescence while not seeing the H&E
sections, special stains, and EM.

RENAL DISEASE 2

Renal disease 2: necrotizing crescentic
glomerulonephritis
Clinical features
• Presentation is usually fulminant.
• Associated with systemic vasculitis (Wegener’s granulomatosis,
microscopic polyarteritis) or renal-limited disease.
• See Chapter 13.

Investigations (see Box 6.1)
• ANCA and anti-GBM antibody are required.
• Positive ANCA by immunoﬂuorescence should be titred (so that the
reduction by plasmapheresis can be checked) and should be typed as
proteinase 3 (Pr3)- or myeloperoxidase (MPO)-positive.
• Quantitative anti-GBM is also helpful when patients are
plasmapheresed.
• A small number of patients will have both ANCA and GBM
antibodies.
• Routine serology for ANA, dsDNA, C3, C4, and acute-phase reactants
should also be taken as a baseline.
• Renal biopsy: examination should include direct immunoﬂuorescence
and EM as well as normal histological stains.
• Monitoring of patients subsequently should include ANCA titre
and CRP/ESR—a rising titre of ANCA may herald relapse, but the
numerical value has no relation to disease activity.

CHAPTER 6

Autoimmunity

Treatment
• Patients should be plasmapheresed acutely, starting
immunosuppressive therapy at the same time.
• Treatment should not be delayed waiting for antibody results:
• 5% of patients will be ANCA negative
• therefore out-of-hours ANCA is not required.
• Immunosuppression is with high-dose steroids with cyclophosphamide.
• Initial treatment is given as pulsed intravenous therapy: the merits of
continuous oral cyclophosphamide therapy versus pulsed intravenous
or oral are still debated.
• Azathioprine and mycophenolate mofetil have been suggested as
possible alternatives to cyclophosphamide after the initial phase.

Renal disease 3: immune complex
glomerulonephritis
• Immune complex glomerulonephritis may be triggered by a host of
antigenic stimuli:
• bacteria: nephritogenic streptococci, staphylococci (SBE)
treponemes, mycoplasma, salmonella
• viruses: EBV, CMV, HIV, hepatitis B, hepatitis C
• fungi: Candida (systemic infection)
• parasites: Plasmodium species, Schistosoma, Toxoplasma
• drugs: xeno-antisera (serum sickness)
• connective tissue diseases: SLE, mixed connective tissue disease
(MCTD, rarer)
• tumours: lymphoma, carcinoma.
• Also associated with complement deﬁciency:
• any component
• C3-nephritic factor (secondary consumption).

Diagnosis (see Box 6.2)
• The circumstances under which the glomerulonephritis develops gives
useful clues as to the diagnosis.
• Activity of the renal disease is marked by the presence of casts
(especially red-cell) in the urinary sediment.
• The type of immune deposits in the biopsy also give important clues as
to the underlying aetiology.

Renal disease 4: post-streptococcal
glomerulonephritis, mixed essential
cryoglobulinaemia, and IgA
nephropathy
Post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis
• This is accompanied by reduced C3, normal C4, and elevated
complement breakdown products (C3d).
• ASOT will be high, although the rise may take at least a week.
• Normally, the C3 level will return to normal within 8 weeks.
• Persistently low C3 with normal C4 beyond this time, in the presence
of renal disease, suggests the presence of a C3-nephritic factor:
• autoantibody stabilizes the alternative pathway C3-convertase
• this autoantibody is associated with partial lipodystrophy.

Mixed essential cryoglobulinaemia
• Caused by hepatitis C, which explains the high incidence of mixed
essential cryoglobulinaemia in northern Italy.
• Type II cryoglobulin with RhF activity.
• Paraprotein component is usually IgMκ, and the bone marrow often
shows a monoclonal expansion of B cells.
• Features of the disease, other than immune complex glomerulonephritis
and hepatitis, include arthralgia, skin rashes, and neuropathy.

209

210

CHAPTER 6

Autoimmunity

Treatment
• Treatment of the underlying HCV infection (with A-IFN ± ribavirin)
often improves the paraproteinaemia and cryoglobulinaemia.
• Treatment of the abnormal plasma cell clone may require cytotoxics.
• Plasmapheresis may be necessary to reduce the cryoglobulin level.
• Type II or type III cryoglobulins may also be detected in other chronic
infections that cause glomerulonephritis, such as SBE.

IgA nephropathy
• The renal lesion is characterized by deposition of IgA immune
complexes in the glomerulus, as is also seen in the renal lesions
associated with Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP).
• Both this disease and HSP may be associated with HLA-Bw35.
• Serum IgA levels are variable but may be signiﬁcantly elevated.
However, this is not a speciﬁc test, as liver disease and infections may
also lead to persistent elevation of IgA.
• Some types of IgA nephropathy may be associated with IgA class
ANCA, although this is not fully substantiated.

Renal disease 5: anti-GBM disease
(Goodpasture’s syndrome)
Clinical features
• Characterized by glomerulonephritis and sometimes pulmonary
haemorrhage, which may lead to secondary pulmonary
haemosiderosis.
• Lung involvement without renal disease is rare.
• Onset is usually sudden and may be preceded by ﬂu-like symptoms
and arthralgia.
• Disease may be triggered by toxin exposure (hydrocarbon solvents) or
infections.
• Smokers are more likely to develop lung haemorrhage than non-smokers.
• May also be caused by penicillamine therapy.
• Associated with other autoimmune diseases, including Wegener’s
granulomatosis, M-PAN, thyroid disease, Behçet’s disease, coeliac
disease, inﬂammatory bowel disease, thymoma, lymphoma, and other
malignancies.

Immunopathology
• Characterized by the presence in almost all cases of an autoantibody
directed against the non-collagenous region of the A3-chain of type IV
collagen (anti-GBM antibodies).
• This antigen is missing in patients with Alport’s syndrome (hereditary
deafness and glomerulonephritis), and these patients make a
nephritogenic antibody if transplanted with a normal kidney.
• Type IV collagen forms the basement membrane in both the
glomerulus and lung, but is also found in the cochlear basement

RENAL DISEASE 5: ANTI-GBM DISEASE (GOODPASTURE’S SYNDROME)

membrane, eye, and choroid of the brain, and in liver, adrenal,
pituitary, and thyroid.
• Eye and brain disease may occasionally be found in anti-GBM disease.

Immunogenetics
• Disease is strongly MHC-associated (DRw15(DR2)/DQw6, DR4/DQw7).
• Male:female ratio is 6:1.

Investigations (see Box 6.3)
• Renal biopsy shows the typical appearance of basement membrane
deposition of IgG (rarely IgA or IgM) and a C3 (linear staining), which
is best seen in the glomeruli. This can also be seen on good bronchial
biopsies.
• Serum invariably contains high levels of circulating anti-GBM antibodies
(>90% of patients are positive), which should be quantitated to allow
monitoring of therapy.
• Patient should be screened for coincident ANCA-positive vasculitis.
• Disease can recur in a transplanted kidney. If antibodies are still
present, transplantation should be deferred for a minimum of 6
months, and preferably 12 months, after the antibody has disappeared
from the circulation.
• Therefore serial monitoring over long periods is justiﬁed when
transplantation is considered or has been undertaken.

Treatment
• Acute treatment involves plasmapheresis (although the controlled trial
data to support this are sparse) or immunoadsorption with protein G
columns (experimental).
• Longer-term therapy involves steroids and cyclophosphamide (IV
pulsed therapy), although the optimal regime has not been deﬁned.
• Aggressive therapy should be continued until the antibody level drops
signiﬁcantly.

Autoimmunity

Renal disease 6: Idiopathic
membranous nephropathy
Idiopathic membranous nephropathy is a common cause of nephrotic
syndrome in adults.
• May be associated with autoantibody against phospholinase A2
receptor.
• Autoantibody may be 19G4.
• Correlates with disease activity.

CHAPTER 7

Autoimmunity in gastrointestinal disease

Autoimmune enteropathy
Autoantibodies against gut enterocytes have been associated with:
• Coeliac-like enteropathy (DQ2 positive), unresponsive to gluten-free
diet, with villous atrophy.
• IPEX syndrome (see Chapters 1 and 4).
• Post stem cell transplantation.

Achalasia
Clinical features
•
•
•
•
•

Patients develop dysphagia for both liquids and solids.
Eventual massive dilatation of the oesophagus occurs.
Occurs in early to middle adult life.
Marked increase in the risk of subsequent oesophageal carcinoma.
Similar features occurs in the trypanosomal infection Chagas’ disease.

Immunopathology
• Achalasia results from damage to the myenteric inhibitory neurons of
the lower oesophagus.
• Autoantibodies have been described that recognize the neurons of
Auerbach’s plexus in the oesophageal wall in the idiopathic form of
the disease; these are probably an epiphenomenon, and not diseaseinducing.
• 25% of patients with achalasia have autoimmune thyroid disease.

Treatment
• The lower oesophageal sphincter is dilated endoscopically or the
muscle divided surgically (Heller’s myotomy).
• Drugs to relax smooth muscle are also used (calcium-channel blockers
and nitrates).
• Botulinum toxin type A (Botox) injections may give temporary relief.

Eosinophilic gastroenteritis
(including oesophagitis)
Presentation
• Non-speciﬁc GI symptoms: abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, weight
loss, distension, reﬂux-like disease, dysphagia (oesophagus).
• Associated with cholangitis, appendicitis, pancreatitis, giant duodenal
ulcer, and eosinophilic inﬁltration of spleen.
• iincidence associated atopic disease and urticaria, and coeliac disease.
• Any age/race/sex; higher incidence in later life. Incidence appears to be
increasing.
• May be seasonal variation in presentation (higher in summer).

CROHN’S DISEASE

Immunopathology
• Possible association with food allergy (iIgE to foods).
• Association with hypereosinophilic syndromes (see Chapter 3).
• iIL-5, IL-13, IL-15, ﬁbroblast growth factor 9, and eotaxin.

Diagnosis
• Conﬁrm by biopsy: >15 eosinophils/HPF.
• Bowel wall may be thickened on scans.
• Exclude other systemic and local diseases where bowel eosinophilia
may be seen (Crohn’s disease, polyarteritis nodosa, Churg-Strauss
syndrome, malignancy, parasites).

Treatment
• Corticosteroids: may be used as swallowed steroid from inhaler for
oesophagitis; oral budesonide for eosinophilic enteritis.
• Trial of elimination diet if speciﬁc IgE to foods identiﬁed (rarely
successful).
• Sodium cromoglicate, ketotifen, and montelukast can be tried.
• Omalizumab and anti-IL5 Mab have been tried in a small number of
cases.

Crohn’s disease
Presentation
• Crohn’s disease is an inﬂammatory disease affecting any part of the
bowel, which may also be accompanied by disease distant from the
bowel (skin, muscle).
• Presents with diarrhoea and abdominal pain, or with evidence of the
extra-GI complications.
• Inﬂammation is transmural and granulomata are present.
• There is superﬁcial ulceration and crypt abscesses.
• Skin lesions are common, and the deep penetrating ulceration
frequently gives rise to ﬁstulae.
• Associated with seronegative arthritis, uveitis, and sclerosing
cholangitis.
• Malabsorption (especially of vitamin B12, as the terminal ileum is
frequently affected) may occur.

Immunogenetics
• Associated with DR5, DQ1 haplotype, or DRB*0301 allele.
• Strong association with NOD-2 (CARD15) gene on chromosome 16
that senses bacterial peptidoglycan and regulates NF-κB expression.
• Over 30 genes which contribute directly or indirectly have been
identiﬁed including:
• X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1)—a transcription factor regulating
immune system genes in response to stress (endoplasmic reticulum
and unfolded protein response)
• autophagy-related protein 16-1 (ATG16L1).

215

216

CHAPTER 7

Autoimmunity in gastrointestinal disease

Immunopathology
• It has long been suspected that the disease is related to an infection,
and current attention has focused on Mycobacterium paratuberculosis,
which causes Jonne’s disease in cattle.
• Measles has also been suggested as a possible trigger.
• There is evidence of both a cell-mediated response and defective
T-cell suppressor function.
• Excess TH17 cells are critical to disease development.
• Increased B-cell activity with immunoglobulin and complement
deposition in damaged bowel.
• Activated macrophages are present and mast-cell numbers are
increased.
• Excessive inﬂammatory cytokines are present (TNFA).
• Crohn’s disease should be considered to be a form of host-defence
disease with impairment of the ability to handle intestinal bacteria
correctly.

Diagnosis (see Box 7.1)
• Crohn’s disease is associated with speciﬁc autoantibodies:
• non-MPO P-ANCA (up to 25% of patients)
• P-ANCA in Crohn’s disease is associated with colonic disease
• anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies (ASCA) (present in 60-70%
of patients)
• combination of ANCA with ASCA is said have a 97% speciﬁcity for
Crohn’s disease (49% sensitivity).
• Other antibodies found in Crohn’s disease include:
• anti-cardiolipin
• anti-mycobacterial heat-shock protein
• rheumatoid factors
• anti-goblet cell
• outer-membrane porin C (OMPC)—bacterial antigen
• pancreatic autoantibodies
• antibodies against tropomyosin isoform 5
• antibodies against red cell membrane antigens that cross-react with
Campylobacter—associated with haemolysis in Crohn’s disease
• antibodies to a range of glycans (laminanbioside, chitobioside,
mannobioside, laminarin, chitin).
• none of these antibodies has realistic diagnostic value.
• Monitoring is best done with acute-phase markers ESR/CRP.
• A1-acid glycoprotein (orosomucoid) was said to be more sensitive as
an acute-phase marker for inﬂammatory bowel disease, but it really
adds nothing to CRP.

Treatment
• Treatment is with steroids, azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine,
methotrexate, ciclosporin, mycophenolate mofetil, and
5-aminosalicyclic acid derivatives.
• Patients on immunosuppression need monitoring for side effects
and prophylaxis against opportunist infections.
• Thalidomide is also used for its anti-TNF effect.

ULCERATIVE COLITIS (UC)

• Resistant disease is treated with anti-TNF agents: inﬂiximab (5mg/
kg), etanercept, adalimumab (Humira®), or certolizumab (Cimzia®)
(pegylated Fab fragment of humanized anti-TNF).
• Complications include development of TB, lymphoma, and
autoimmune disease.
• Natalizumab (Tysabri®), a humanized mAb against the A4 integrin, has
been licensed in the USA for remission induction and maintenance of
severe Crohn’s disease. A major risk is development of progressive
multifocal leucoencephalopathy (PML).

Ulcerative colitis (UC)
Presentation
• An inﬂammatory disease limited to the colon.
• Presentation is usually with bloody diarrhoea.
• Extra-intestinal manifestations include:
• seronegative arthritis (sacroiliitis)
• uveitis
• pyoderma gangrenosum
• erythema nodosum
• sclerosing cholangitis.
• Pancolitis may cause a toxic megacolon, a medical/surgical emergency.

Immunogenetics
• Pancolitis is associated with HLA DRB1*0103—this is also associated
with an increase in extra-intestinal complications.
• Also associated with allele 2 of the IL-1 receptor antagonist.
• Multiple genetic loci associated with UC.

Immunopathology
• Unlike Crohn’s disease, the disease is continuous and does not include
the presence of granulomata. Otherwise the histology is similar.
• Increase in activated T cells (CD4+, DR+, CD45RO+) and also
inﬂammatory cells, including neutrophils.

217

218

CHAPTER 7

Autoimmunity in gastrointestinal disease

Autoantibodies
• Autoantibodies to colonic epithelial cells have been described (which
are cytotoxic). These are not diagnostically valuable.
• Atypical P-ANCA (non-MPO) are also seen; a number of candidate
antigens have been suggested as the target for this atypical P-ANCA,
including lactoferrin and cathepsin G (?related to reactions to enteric
bacteria).
• 50-70% of UC patients will be atypical P-ANCA+.
• P-ANCA positivity is associated with pancolitis and primary sclerosing
cholangitis.
• 10-15% of patients may have anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies
(ASCA)—diagnostic utility is low.

Diagnosis
• Made on colonoscopic appearance and biopsy.
• Inﬂammatory markers (ESR/CRP) are elevated and provide a useful
way of monitoring disease.

Treatment
• Treatment is with topical or systemic steroids, azathioprine, and
5-aminosalicyclic acid derivatives.
• Anti-TNF agents appear to be less effective in UC than in Crohn’s
disease.
• Signiﬁcantly increased risk of carcinoma of the colon, so those with
pancolitis will usually have a totally colectomy, which is curative.
Regular surveillance by colonoscopy may be sufﬁcient for milder
disease.

Whipple’s disease
Presentation
• Multisystem disease with diarrhoea, steatorrhoea, fever, weight loss,
abdominal pain, migratory arthritis, and eye and CNS involvement.
• Features of a signiﬁcant protein-losing enteropathy may occur.
• Dementia occurs as late complication.
• More common in men.

Aetiology
• Now known to be caused by infection with the unusual bacterium
Tropheryma whippelii.
• T.whippelii is a common mouth commensal, and therefore rarely causes
the disease, suggesting a subtle immunodeﬁciency in those who do
develop it.

Immunopathology
• There is a secondary hypogammaglobulinaemia, and also gut loss of
T cells, leading to a secondary combined immunodeﬁciency.
• Biopsies show typical Schiff-positive macrophages abundant in the
bowel wall.

COELIAC DISEASE

Diagnosis

• There are no routinely available serological tests, but PCR-based tests
are available.

Treatment

• Prolonged courses (>1 year) of antibiotics (ampicillin, doxycycline
(with hydroxychloroquine), co-trimoxazole if there is neurological
involvement).
• Treatment courses <1 year are associated with 40% relapse rate.

Coeliac disease
Presentation
• Common inﬂammatory disease of the small intestine, triggered by
wheat gliadin (gluten).
• Particularly common in western Ireland (prevalence 1 in 300).
• In the UK occurs in 1 in 1500 people.
• The symptoms can appear at any age.
• In childhood there is failure to thrive, while in adults the disease often
comes to light during the investigation of unexplained anaemia (usually
iron-deﬁcient anaemia).
• Malabsorption may be obvious, but many patients do not have
signiﬁcant steatorrhoea.
• Many adult patients may have a normal or increased weight (due to
compensatory hyperphagia).
• Strong associations with the blistering skin rash dermatitis
herpetiformis (see Chapter 10) and with autoimmune diseases
particularly diabetes, thyroid disease, Addison’s disease, and SLE.
• Gluten sensitivity has been associated with an encephalopathy and a
cerebellar syndrome, which respond to gluten withdrawal.

Immunogenetics
• Associated with HLA-B8, DR3, DQ2.
• 95% of patients are DQ2 positive, but only a minority of people with
DQ2 develop coeliac disease.
• 10% of patients will have selective IgA deﬁciency.

Immunopathology
• Typical histological features are of total villous atrophy.
• Subtotal villous atrophy and an increase in intra-epithelial lymphocytes
in the early stages are also compatible with the diagnosis.
• Total villous atrophy is not required to make the diagnosis.
• The amount of gluten being consumed by the patient at the time of
biopsy will have a signiﬁcant bearing on the biopsy ﬁndings.

Autoantibodies
• The standard serological tests for coeliac disease are IgA endomysial
antibodies (EMA) (monkey oesophagus sections or human umbilical

219

220

CHAPTER 7

Autoimmunity in gastrointestinal disease

vein) or ELISA assays for antibodies against recombinant human tissue
transglutaminase (tTG).
• IgA tTG assays have been recommended by NICE for screening
but are too sensitive (i false-positive rate); IgA EMA are better for
screening.
• IgA tTG are better for monitoring response to gluten-free diet
(quantitative).
• NICE recommends the annual screening of children with type I
diabetes for the development of IgA EMA/tTG antibodies.
• As IgA deﬁciency may occur, testing for IgA deﬁciency as part of
screening has been recommended, although some centres have
dropped this.
• In IgA deﬁciency IgG anti-EMA or tTG have the same signiﬁcance.
• There is no place for the use of R1 reticulin antibodies or IgA and IgG
anti-gliadin antibodies, which have low sensitivity and speciﬁcity.

Diagnosis (see Box 7.2)
• Differential diagnosis for coeliac disease is wide, and includes
inﬂammatory bowel disease, true food allergy (excess eosinophils
on biopsy), infections (Giardia), and connective tissue diseases
(scleroderma).
• The gold standard for diagnosis is still biopsy of the jejunum, although
endoscopic biopsy of the duodenum usually gives satisfactory and
equivalent results.
• Serological tests are now recognized to have high sensitivity and
speciﬁcity, and many patients, particularly children, will not be
biopsied, although best practice indicates that patients should still be
biopsied if possible.
• Positive antibodies with normal biopsy may represent a prodromal
state.
• Children with type I diabetes should be screened annually for coeliac
disease.

Treatment
• Treatment is lifelong gluten avoidance.
• Abnormal bowel returns to normal when gluten is withdrawn from the
diet.
• Antibodies gradually disappear with gluten avoidance and reappear on
gluten challenge.
• IgA/IgG EMA/tTG can be used as a tool to monitor compliance
with the diet.
• Compliance is important, as continued exposure to gluten increases
the risk of intestinal lymphoma (T-cell).
• Secondary splenic atrophy may occur (Howell-Jolly bodies on blood ﬁlm).
• Such patients should be treated in the same way as fully asplenic
patients with prophylactic antibiotics and regular checks on
pneumococcal and Hib antibodies, with appropriate booster
immunizations as required to maintain antibody levels (see Chapter 2).
• Dermatitis herpetiformis usually responds to gluten withdrawal, but
may require treatment with dapsone (care in G6PD-deﬁcient patients).

• May include mesenteric panniculitis.
• Biopsy will be required for conﬁrmation.
• May be associated with other autoimmune conditions (thyroid,
sclerosing cholangitis, SLE) and autoimmune pancreatitis (see below).
• Treatment may include corticosteroids, tamoxifen (to reduce
production of TGF-β), colchine, cyclophosphamide, and thalidomide.

Autoimmune pancreatitis
• Rare disorder, presenting with abdominal pain, pancreatic masses,
pancreatic duct strictures, obstructive jaundice (and obstructive LFTs).
• Characterized by IgG4 plasma cell inﬁltrate in pancreas.
• Raised serum IgG4.
• Autoantibodies to plasminogen-binding protein (PBP) may be a
marker, but can be found also in patients with pancreatic cancer.
• Other autoantibodies may be found (ANA, AMA, ASMA, ANCA).
• Responds to corticosteroids; steroid-sparing agents may be required
(mycophenolate mofetil, cyclophosphamide).

CHAPTER 7

Autoimmunity in gastrointestinal disease

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)
• Common condition of unknown aetiology. Theories include:
• disturbance of brain-gut axis
• infection.
• Evidence supporting the role of IgG antibodies to foods is weak:
• such antibodies can be found in healthy normal individuals
• there is insufﬁcient evidence to justify the use of extensive
IgG antibody testing to direct dietary modiﬁcation.
• NICE-BDA Guidelines advise the avoidance of ‘resistant starches’
(starchy foods that have been cooked or reprocessed more than
once).
• All patients claiming that wheat exacerbates symptoms must have
coeliac disease excluded (see above).
• There is a strong association with CFS/ME, ﬁbromyalgia, depression,
and anxiety. Stress invariably exacerbates symptoms.

CHAPTER 8

Autoimmunity in liver disease

Primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC)
Presentation
• PBC is a disease of older women (90% of patients are female).
• Clinical features include initially:
• profound fatigue starting in the prodrome
• intense itch
• arthralgia.
• With disease progression:
• hepatosplenomegaly
• xanthelasma
• skin pigmentation
• eventually hepatic decompensation with jaundice.
• The disease is strongly associated with other autoimmune diseases,
including Sjögren’s syndrome, thyroid disease, cryptogenic ﬁbrosing
alveolitis, CREST (calcinosis, Raynaud’s, oesophageal dysmotility,
sclerodactyly, and telangiectasia), and renal tubular acidosis.
• Other autoimmune diseases (any type) occur more rarely.

Immunogenetics
• No speciﬁc genetic linkages identiﬁed (familial occurrence is
uncommon).
• Cause unknown, but epidemiological work on clusters of disease
suggests a possible infectious aetiology.
• It is particularly common in the northeast of England.

Immunopathology
• Not strictly a cirrhotic disease, as the primary pathology is
inﬂammation around the portal triads (intrahepatic bile ducts), leading
eventually to ﬁbrosis.
• Occasional overlap patients occur with features of PBC and also of
chronic autoimmune hepatitis.
• Increased HLA-DR expression on the biliary epithelium and an
inﬁltrate of CD4+ T cells speciﬁc for biliary epithelial antigens.
• An excess of IgM-producing B cells is seen around the biliary ducts.

Diagnosis (see Box 8.1)
• LFTs show elevated alkaline phosphatase. Caeruloplasmin,
lipoproteins, and cholesterol are also raised.
• Biopsy shows typical features.
• Total IgM levels are polyclonally raised, often signiﬁcantly (20-30g/L),
although the reason for this is not known.
• Occasionally small monoclonal bands will be seen on electrophoresis.
• Autoantibodies are diagnostic.

Autoantibodies
• Typical immunological features are the presence of mitochondrial
antibodies, found in 96% of cases.
• A variety of different mitochondrial antibody patterns are identiﬁable
(with difﬁculty!) by immunoﬂuorescence (see Chapter 18 for
descriptions).
• The M2 pattern is most commonly associated with PBC.
• M2 autoantigens have now been identiﬁed as trypsin-sensitive
molecules on the inner mitochondrial membrane.
• Primary antigen is the large multimeric 2-oxo-acid dehydrogenase
complex, pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC).
• M2a recognizes the E2 subcomponent (dihydrolipoamide
acyltransferase) of PDC (95% of PBC).
• M2c recognizes the E2 antigen of oxoglutarate dehydrogenase
(OGDC) (39-88% of PBC) and branch-chain 2-oxo-acid
dehydrogenase (BCOADC) (54%), and the protein X component
of PDC (95%).
• M2d and M2e antigens are the E1-A and E1-B? components of PDC
(41-66% and 2-7%, respectively).
• Solid-phase assays are available for M2 antigens and should be used to
conﬁrm the speciﬁcity of antibodies identiﬁed by immunoﬂuorescence.
• Antibodies recognize conserved epitopes on related proteins found in
fungi and bacteria.
• Antibodies, which are mainly IgM and IgG3, are known to inhibit
enzyme function and may penetrate viable cells.

225

226

CHAPTER 8

Autoimmunity in liver disease

• Other antibodies have been thought to identify subgroups of PBC.
• M9 antibody (anti-glycogen phosphorylase) may be a marker for
early PBC with a benign prognosis (also found in low titres in
healthy individuals).
• M4 antibody may be a marker of aggressive disease (anti-sulphite
oxidase).
• Non-M2 anti-mitochondrial antibodies (AMAs) are found in
myocarditis, SLE, syphilis, and some drug reactions.
• Antinuclear antibodies are also found in PBC: HEp-2 cells may show
multiple nuclear dots (MND) and perinuclear staining.
• MND-ANA (Nsp-1, Nsp-2) are found in 10-44% of PBC patients,
especially associated with Sjögren’s syndrome. The Nsp-1 antigen
is p80-coilin. Nsp-2 antigen is Sp100 (pseudo-centromere). Both
may occur in the absence of AMA, but it is not clear whether this
subgroup is clinically different.
• As CREST may also be associated with PBC, true centromere
antibodies may be found (very confusing!). The presence of
true anti-centromere antibodies in PBC is prognostic for portal
hypertension.
• Punctate perinuclear staining is due to autoantibody to the
major glycoprotein of nuclear pores (gp210, found in up to 27%)
and laminin B receptor. Both may occur in AMA-negative PBC.
Antibodies to gp210 are associated with higher mortality and
poorer outcome.
• Antibodies to p62 (nucleoporin) are more frequent in stage IV
disease and are associated with more severe disease.
• Antibodies to carbonic anhydrase II have been identiﬁed in
mitochondrial antibody negative and positive PBC.

Treatment
• Treatment with immunosuppressive drugs has been thought to be
unhelpful, but a trial of rituximab is now under way.
• Colchicine and penicillamine have both been tried with limited beneﬁt.
• Ursodeoxycholic acid may improve symptoms but does not alter the
prognosis.
• Colestyramine is used to relieve itch.
• Transplantation is used for endstage disease.

Autoimmune hepatitis
Presentation
• Before a diagnosis of autoimmune hepatitis can be made, it is
important to exclude other causes:
• toxic (alcohol, drugs)
• metabolic diseases (Wilson’s disease, haemochromatosis,
A1-antitrypsin deﬁciency)
• viral causes, although there is a complex link between autoimmune
hepatitis and HCV.

AUTOIMMUNE HEPATITIS

• Predominantly a disease of younger women (90% of patients are
female).
• May present with acute hepatitis, jaundice, profound malaise and
fatigue, and amenorrhoea in women (?autoimmune).
• May be marked extra-hepatic features: vitiligo and alopecia, thyroid
disease, pernicious anaemia, type I diabetes mellitus, autoimmune
haemolytic anaemia and ITP, rheumatoid arthritis, ulcerative colitis,
glomerulonephritis, cryptogenic ﬁbrosing alveolitis, and coeliac disease.

Immunogenetics
• There is a strong association with HLA-B1, B8, DR3, DR4.

Immunopathology
• Major features are piecemeal necrosis of hepatocytes in the periportal
region.
• There is an inﬁltrate of CD4+ T cells and B cells.
• Later stages of the disease show typical cirrhosis.

Diagnosis (see Box 8.2)
•
•
•
•

LFTs show markedly elevated transaminases.
Prothrombin time may be prolonged in late disease.
Markers of hepatitis virus infection are absent.
Polyclonal hypergammaglobulinaemia (mainly IgG and IgA).

addition to the LKM antibodies.
• Autoantibodies to nuclear components, dsDNA, smooth muscle (antiactin), LKM antibodies, and liver membranes can be detected.
• Low-titre AMA may also be detected.
The pattern of antibodies present has led to a classiﬁcation scheme for
autoimmune hepatitis.

228

CHAPTER 8

Autoimmunity in liver disease

• Autoimmune hepatitis type 1 (AIH-1) is ANA+, smooth muscle
antibody (SMA)+, P-ANCA+, and soluble liver antigen (SLA) antibody+.
• In AIH-1, 50% are ANA+/SMA+, 15% are ANA+ only, and 35% are
SMA+ only.
• 8% of AIH-1 are SLA+ only.
• Typically occurs in adults, has a better prognosis, and responds well
to therapy; 90% female.
• High frequency of extrahepatic features.
• Previously known as lupoid hepatitis.
• Autoimmune hepatitis type 2a (AIH-2a) is typically liver-kidney
microsomal (LKM-1, LKM-3) antibody+ and liver cytosol (LC-1)
antibody+.
• 43% of AIH-2 are LC-1+ only.
• AIH-2a is seen in children (50% of cases) and has a worse prognosis
with poor response to therapy.
• Associated with thyroid and gastric parietal cell autoimmunity.
• Hypergammaglobulinaemia is less marked; IgA is usually low.
• Autoimmune hepatitis type 2b (AIH-2b).
• HCV-associated; HCV-RNA positive, antibodies to HCV positive.
• No female predominance; occurs in over-40s; milder disease.
• No extra-hepatic features.
• LKM-1 positive (NB: HCV antigen cross-reactive with P450 (IID6)
cytochrome).
• Autoimmune hepatitis type 3 (AIH-3) is ANA-, LKM-, SLA+. SMA and
AMA are seen less commonly.
• Most patients are women (90%) and have a similar presentation to
that of type 1.
• Autoimmune hepatitis type 4 (AIH-4).
• Overlap syndrome of autoimmune hepatitis and PBC; AMA positive
with antibodies to M2 antigen.
• There are cases of biopsy-proven but serologically negative hepatitis.
• Tests for both SLA and LC-1 should be performed.
• LKM-1 antibodies recognize the cytochrome P450IID6 and are
associated with types 2a and 2b autoimmune chronic active hepatitis.

Other autoantibodies in hepatitis
• Liver-kidney microsomal antibodies may be found in autoimmune
hepatitis and recognize different hepatic cytochrome enzymes.
• LKM-1: cytochrome P450 (IID6). associated with types 2a and 2b
autoimmune hepatitis. Antibodies to LKM-1 may be triggered by
HCV and HSV as both have proteins sharing homology with P450
(IID6).
• LKM-2: cytochrome P450 (IIC9). Drug-induced, tienilic acid, in
France only.
• LKM-3: glucuronyl transferase. Hepatitis delta infection. These
antibodies are speciﬁc to human liver.
• Liver microsome antibodies (LM): cytochrome P450IA2. Druginduced hepatitis, dihydralazine.

PRIMARY SCLEROSING CHOLANGITIS

• SLA antibodies recognize liver cytokeratins 8 and 18.
• LC antibodies may recognize arginosuccinate lyase (and at least one
other cytosolic antigen).

Treatment
•
•
•
•

Prognosis depends on type and early diagnosis.
Treatment depends on the underlying cause.
Treat any viral trigger (HCV) with α-IFN ?± ribavirin.
Immunosuppressive therapy with corticosteroids (high dose) is used
and a good initial response deﬁnes a good prognosis.
• Azathioprine is useful for maintaining remission.
• Ciclosporin and tacrolimus have also been used.
• Liver transplantation may be required for endstage disease in young
patients.

Primary sclerosing cholangitis
• An inﬂammatory disease of intra- and extra-hepatic bile ducts, leading
to ﬁbrosis.
• More common in men than women and can occur at any age.
• Associated with HLA-A1, B8, DR3.
• May lead to cholangiocarcinoma.
• Strongly associated with inﬂammatory bowel disease (see Chapter 7).
• LFTs are similar to those for PBC.
• Anti-mitochondrial antibodies are absent, the IgM is not raised, and
atypical P-ANCA may be found. P-ANCA is present in about 80% of
cases.
• Anti-nuclear and anti-smooth muscle antibodies may be present in
25-50% of cases.
• Diagnosis is made by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography
(ERCP) or magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP).
• Immunosuppressive treatment is unhelpful. Liver transplantation may
be required.

CHAPTER 9

Autoimmune haematological disorders

Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP)
Presentation
• ITP can occur at any age and is characterized by thrombocytopenia,
with increased marrow megakaryocytes, and shortened platelet
survival.
• Presentation is usually with sudden onset of petechiae, particularly
around the feet, and bleeding (nose, gums, bowel, urinary tract).
• Can occur with:
• infection (including HIV)
• drugs (the list is very long!)
• malignancy (lymphoma, adenocarcinoma)
• common variable immunodeﬁciency
• other autoimmune diseases (SLE, thyroid disease, autoimmune
hepatitis).
• Neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia may occur in mothers who
are negative for the platelet antigen PLA1, who become sensitized
in prior pregnancies where infants are PLA1 positive or by blood
transfusion; other platelet antigen systems have also been involved.

Immunopathology
• Antibody-coated platelets are destroyed by the phagocytic cells in the
peripheral blood.
• Many platelet antigens have been shown to be targets for the
autoimmune response, including GPIIb/IIIA, GPIb/IX and GP V (after
chickenpox).
• Detection of anti-platelet antibodies is difﬁcult and few centres offer
this routinely.
• A wide variety of tests are used.

Diagnosis (see Box 9.1)
• Diagnosis can usually be made clinically, with the assistance of a bone
marrow examination.
• Investigations are needed to rule out associated autoimmune disease
(SLE), immunodeﬁciency, and malignancy.
• Drug history should be reviewed.

AUTOIMMUNE HAEMOLYTIC ANAEMIA

Treatment
• Treatment is complex and should be undertaken by a haematologist.
• Any underlying cause should be treated or removed (drugs).
• Therapy is determined by the severity of the thrombocytopenia:
counts of <20x109/L usually lead to bleeding problems.
• First-line therapy is either steroids or hdIVIg.
• Thromopoetin receptor antagonists (romiplostim, a fusion protein
analogue of thrombopoetin) are likely to replace IVIg and have
been approved by NICE. Romiplostim is administered weekly as a
subcutaneous injection.
• Second-line therapies include cytotoxics, danazol, dapsone, and
splenectomy.
• Rituximab may be valuable in resistant cases (unlicensed indication).
• If splenectomy is undertaken, the usual precautions should be taken
(see Chapter 2, p.112).

Autoimmune haemolytic anaemia
Classiﬁcation
Immune haemolytic anaemia is divided into two categories depending on
the temperature at which haemolysis takes place.
• Warm haemolytic anaemia:
• idiopathic autoimmune (AIHA)
• secondary to other diseases—SLE, CVID, lymphoid malignancy,
hepatitis.
• Cold haemolytic anaemia:
• idiopathic cold agglutinin disease
• cold agglutinins secondary to infection (Mycoplasma pneumoniae,
EBV)
• cold antibody disease (Donath-Landsteiner antibody, occurs
in childhood or secondary to syphilis)—paroxysmal cold
haemoglobinuria
• cold antibody disease secondary to lymphoma (CHAD).
• Other causes of haemolytic anaemia include:
• drug-induced (which may be due to bystander immune-complexmediated damage or direct binding of antigen (e.g. penicillin) to the
red cell membrane causing the formation of an immunoreactive
neo-antigen)
• massive haemolysis may occur following mismatched blood
transfusions (ABO incompatibility, preformed isoagglutinins)
• as a result of rhesus incompatibility (rhesus haemolytic disease of
the newborn); in association with ITP (Evans syndrome).

Presentation
• Depends on the underlying cause.
• Signs of anaemia ± jaundice will usually be the presentation.

233

234

CHAPTER 9

Autoimmune haematological disorders

Diagnosis (see Box 9.2)
• The immunological process is identiﬁed by Coombs’ test, which
identiﬁes the presence of immunoglobulin and C3 on the red cell
membrane.
• Assays are done at different temperatures to identify warm or cold
antibodies.
• Panels of typed red cells can be used to identify the speciﬁcity of the
antibody.
• In the direct test, an anti-human IgG is used to demonstrate pre-bound
IgG on the patient’s red cells.
• In the indirect test, the patient’s serum is incubated with normal
erythrocytes to demonstrate the presence of anti-red cell antibodies in
the serum.
• Pre-bound antibody can be eluted from the red cell for further studies.
• Serum haptoglobins are decreased during active haemolysis and serum
LDH is increased.
• Check autoantibody screen for ANA (dsDNA, ENA) if appropriate.

Autoantibodies
• Antigenic speciﬁcities vary according the cause of the anaemia.
• Most warm antibodies are against the rhesus system antigens or
against the band 3 anion transporter.
• Cold antibodies due to Mycoplasma recognize the I-antigen
• Those induced by EBV recognize I-antigen.
• Lymphoma-associated cold agglutinin disease is characterized by a
monoclonal IgM (usually κ not λ) with anti-I speciﬁcity.
• Donath-Landsteiner antibody recognizes the P antigen (receptor
for Pavovirus B19).
• Three classes of drug-induced antibodies to red cells are recognized.
• Antibodies binding to the drug itself on the red cell, where red cell
damage is ‘accidental’. These antibodies are usually warm.
• Drugs binding to a complex of drug and red cell membrane antigen
(but binding only weakly or not at all to red cells without the drug).
These may be cold antibodies.
• Antibodies induced by the drug but binding to the red cell in
the absence of the drug and recognizing Rhesus antigens. These
antibodies are usually warm.

Treatment
• Treatment of any underlying disorder is required (lymphoma,
infection).
• Any suspect drug should be stopped.
• Treatment is similar to that for ITP and splenectomy may be required.
• HdIVIg is much less effective than in ITP.

Autoimmune neutropenia
Presentation
• Usually with bacterial and fungal infections.
• Distinguish in children from congenital neutropenias (isoimmune
neonatal neutropenia, similar to neonatal haemolytic anaemia).
• May occur alone or in conjunction with:
• autoimmune diseases such as SLE, rheumatoid arthritis (Felty’s
syndrome, especially if DR4+), Sjögren’s syndrome, PBC,
autoimmune hepatitis
• malignancy such as lymphoma or large granular lymphocyte (LGL)
leukaemia
• infection (CMV, EBV)
• drug exposure (penicillins and cephalosporins), owing to immune
mechanisms. Agranulocytosis may occur after exposure to a
number of drugs, of which the most important is carbimazole.

Diagnosis
• All patients will require a bone marrow examination if neutropenia is
severe and persistent.
• Screen for associated autoimmune disease (ANA, dsDNA, ENA, TPO,
GPC).
• Attempts to detect anti-neutrophil-speciﬁc antibodies are hampered
by the non-speciﬁc binding of immunoglobulins via neutrophil Fc
receptors.
• Two surface antigens (HNA1a and HNA1b, previously known as
NA1 and NA2, recognizing isoforms of CD16, FcGRIII) have been
identiﬁed in primary autoimmune neutropenia of childhood.

235

236

CHAPTER 9

Autoimmune haematological disorders

• In adults some patients have had antibodies against the complement
receptor CD11b/CD18; also CD35 and CD177 (neutrophil
glycoprotein, previously known as NB1).
• Patients with Felty’s syndrome may have antibodies to an
elongation factor eEFIA-1.

Treatment
• Treatment is not usually required until the neutrophil count falls below
0.5×109/L.
• Co-trimoxazole and antifungal prophylaxis may be required.
• G-CSF may be valuable in shortening the period of agranulocytosis,
and may be given as a test in patients who are chronically neutropenic
in order to assess the response. Responders can then be given
treatment if they develop infection.
• Treatments with immunosuppressive drugs (steroids, A-IFN, and
2-CDA) have been used.
• Splenectomy may be required with the usual precautions (see Chapter
2 ‘Asplenia’, p.112).
• hdIVIg has been used in primary autoimmune neutropenia, but is much
less effective than in ITP.

Paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria
(PNH)
• Disease is due to an acquired (clonal) deﬁciency of complement
control proteins on the red cell surface.
• Caused by a failure to synthesize glucosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)
membrane anchors (common to a number of important surface
molecules), owing to somatic mutation in the pig-a gene on the
X-chromosome.
• Affected molecules of red cells include CD55 (decay accelerating
factor), CD59 (homologous restriction factor-20, HRF20), and
homologous restriction factor (HRF65, C8-binding protein), all of
which prevent accidental lysis of red cells by complement.
• Red cells tend to lyse at night when the pH of serum drops (hence the
name), and the diagnostic test is a ﬂow cytometric demonstration of
the absence of the relevant surface molecules (CD55, CD59).
• Ham’s acidiﬁcation test is no longer used.
• There is often an associated iron deﬁciency and leucopenia and an
increased risk of haematological malignancy.
• Androgen therapy may be helpful; steroids are not.
• Anticoagulation may be required due to i thrombotic risk.
• Eculizumab (Soliris®), a monoclonal antibody that binds to C5 and
prevents cleavage by the C5 convertase, blocks complement activation
and prevents haemolysis. In the UK, it is available through designated
supra-regional specialist PNH centres.
• Bone marrow transplantation may be required.

ANTI-FACTOR VIII ANTIBODIES (ACQUIRED HAEMOPHILIA)

Aplastic anaemia (AA) and pure red cell
aplasia
Aplastic anaemia (AA)
• Aplastic anaemia, affecting all bone marrow lineages, may arise
following:
• infections (hepatitis B, hepatitis C)
• exposure to toxins (benzene)
• drugs (chloramphenicol, carbamazepine, phenytoin, quinine)
• idiopathic.
• In idiopathic forms, a cellular immune response inhibiting
erythropoiesis is present.
• About 50% of patients with idiopathic AA respond to treatment with
ATG/ALG.
• Androgenic steroids may help, but corticosteroids do not.
• Growth factors are not recommended.
• Ciclosporin may be of beneﬁt.
• Blood transfusion support is required and bone marrow
transplantation is the deﬁnitive procedure.
• 10-33% may develop PNH.

Pure red cell aplasia
• Causes are similar to those of aplastic anaemia but limited to red cell
lineage.
• Other causes include HIV and herpesvirus infections, large granular
lymphocyte (LGL) T-cell leukaemia, and thymoma.
• Parvovirus B19 can cause prolonged red cell aplasia in the
immunosuppressed (PID and HIV). May respond to hdIVIg.
• Autoantibodies to red cell precursors can be detected.
• T-cell responses and inhibitory NK cells have also been demonstrated.
• It may respond to treatment with rituximab.

Anti-factor VIII antibodies (acquired
haemophilia)
• Acquired factor VIII inhibitory autoantibodies may occur:
• in association with SLE and other autoimmune diseases
• in association with drug therapy (phenytoin, penicillin,
chloramphenicol, and sulphonamides)
• as an idiopathic autoimmune disease.
• Autoantibodies can cause a severe clotting disorder.
• Two types of patient are identiﬁed.
• Type I: high-titre antibodies with a high response to further factor
VIII challenge. Avoid further factor VIII.
• type II: low-titre antibodies with a low/absent response to factor
VIII challenge. Treat with high dose factor VIII.

237

238

CHAPTER 9

Autoimmune haematological disorders

• Plasmapheresis or speciﬁc immunoadsorption with protein A columns
(antibodies are usually IgG1 or IgG4) may be required acutely.
• HdIVIg may also be beneﬁcial.
• Rituximab may reduce autoantibody production.
• Steroids and cytotoxic agents may also be used in conjunction with
other measures.
• Tolerance induction using regular factor VIII treatment has been tried
with variable success, but is only recommended if nothing else works!
• Desmopressin (DDAVP) mobilizes factor VIII from storage and may be
a useful adjunct to treatment when inhibitor levels are low.
• Clotting can be controlled using partially activated complexes that
bypass the level of inhibition.
• Prothrombin complex concentrate.
• Recombinant factor VIIa (directly activates factor X, bypassing the
need for factor VIII).

Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia
(HIT)
• Type I HIT is caused by direct heparin-induced platelet aggregation.
• Type II HIT is caused by an autoantibody response against the complex
of heparin and platelet factor 4, which binds to platelet Fc receptors
and activates platelets.
• 90% of these antibodies cross-react with low molecular weight
heparins.
• Low molecular weight heparins have a reduced risk of inducing
autoantibodies.
• Anticoagulation is achieved with non-heparin anticoagulants such
as thrombin inhibitors (argatroban, lepirudin) or fondaparinux
(pentasaccharide factor Xa inhibitor).

Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura
and haemolytic-uraemic syndrome
Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP)
• A fulminant acquired syndrome triggered by:
• pregnancy
• metastatic cancer
• bone marrow transplantation
• viral infections (HIV)
• drugs (ticlopidine, clopidogrel, ciclosporin, tacrolimus, α-IFN).
• Autoantibody inhibits metalloproteinase ADAMTS13 involved in
breakdown of high molecular weight von Willebrand factor (vWF),
causing platelet activation.

ANTI-PHOSPHOLIPID SYNDROME (HUGHES’ SYNDROME)

• Recurrent TTP is associated with genetic deﬁciency of ADAMTS13
(Upshaw-Schulman syndrome):
• phenotype is usually mild
• TTP develops when vWF levels are elevated (infections).
• Treatment involves plasmapheresis and replacement with fresh frozen
plasma 9 immunosuppressive therapy.
• Prophylactic fresh frozen plasma has been used in ADAMTS13
deﬁciency.

Haemolytic-uraemic syndrome

• Major cause (90% of cases) is infection with a strain of Escherichia coli
expressing a Shiga-like toxin (STEC; O157).
• The toxin inactivates the endothelial metalloproteinase ADAMTS13
and allows formation of multimers of vWF which initiate platelet
activation and microthrombus formation.
• Familial forms caused by genetic deﬁciency of factor H and factor I
complement regulatory proteins.
• Rarely, autoantibodies to factor H may cause acquired type.
• Prompt antibiotic treatment is required together with supportive
treatment. Plasmapheresis may be used but platelet transfusion should
be avoided.
• Eculizumab has been used experimentally.

Anti-phospholipid syndrome
(Hughes’ syndrome)

CHAPTER 10

Autoimmune skin disorders

Overview
• The skin is a very easy organ in which to investigate autoimmune
disease, due to its accessibility for biopsy (see Box 10.1).
• Autoantibodies can be detected by either direct immunoﬂuorescence
(DIF) of snap-frozen biopsies or indirect immunoﬂuorescence (IIF)
using the patient’s serum.
• Use of hypertonic saline prior to staining of biopsies splits the
epidermis away from the dermis, between the lamina lucida and the
lamina densa, and allows the site of autoantibody binding to be more
clearly identiﬁed. This is important in distinguishing epidermolysis
bullosa acquisita from bullous pemphigoid.
• Signiﬁcant disease may be present with little or no circulating antibody
and therefore DIF plays a major role in diagnosis.
• Reliable results require an experienced laboratory!

Tests for diagnosis

Tests for monitoring

Skin biopsy (H&E, DIF, split skin, EM)
Indirect IF (monkey oesophagus)

IgA EMA/tTG (compliance with glutenfree diet in dermatitis herpetiformis)

IgA EMA/tTG
Other associated autoantibodies (by EIA)

Bullous pemphigoid
Presentation
• Disease of the elderly characterized by the presence of tense itchy
blisters over limbs and trunk.
• Blistering stage may be preceded by papules or urticaria.
• Mucous membranes may be involved in up to one-third of patients.

Immunogenetics
• Increased prevalence of HLA DQB1*0301.

Immunopathology and diagnosis
• Blister is subepidermal on histology.
• DIF and IIF show mainly linear IgG and C3 at the dermo-epidermal
junction, binding to the epithelial side of the basement membrane (on
a saline-split preparation).
• On immunoelectron microscopy the IgG is located on the lamina
lucida.
• Rate of positivity in DIF is up to 90% and for IIF up to 70%.
• Other immunoglobulin classes may be detected.

HERPES GESTATIONIS AND CICATRICIAL PEMPHIGOID

• Drug reactions may cause similar bullous lesions but with negative
immunoﬂuorescence.
• IgE and eosinophil counts may be raised, although these are not
diagnostically useful.

Autoantibodies
• Two autoantigens have been identiﬁed:
• BPAg1, 230kDa (chromosome 6)
• BPAg2, 180kDa (chromosome 10).
• BPAg1 is similar to desmoplakin I and is likely to form part of the
hemi-desmosome, which provides the major site of attachment
between the internal cytoskeletal proteins and the external matrix.
• Antibodies to BPAg1 are only found in bullous pemphigoid.
• BPAg2 is also a hemi-desmosomal protein, but antibodies are also
found in herpes gestationis.

Treatment
• Mild disease can be treated with topical steroids.
• Severe disease requires high-dose oral steroids, which can be tapered
once remission is obtained.
• Remission may be sustained once steroids are withdrawn.
• Additional immunosuppressive therapy is rarely required, but
azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, ciclosporin, mycophenolate mofetil,
and dapsone have all been used.
• Plasmapheresis has been found not to be of beneﬁt.
• HdIVIg may be of beneﬁt.
• Tetracycline and niacinamide have also been proposed as treatment,
although this is controversial. The mechanism of action is obscure.

Herpes gestationis and cicatricial
pemphigoid
Herpes gestationis
Presentation
• Rare itchy and blistering rash associated with pregnancy.
• Onset is in the second or third trimester or occasionally in the
immediate post-partum period.
• Infant may also be affected due to transplacental passage of the IgG
antibody. This usually resolves spontaneously as maternal antibody
decays.
• The umbilicus is involved, in contrast with another rare disease:
pruritic urticaria and plaques of pregnancy (PUPP).
• May recur in subsequent pregnancies and in response to hormonal
changes during the menstrual cycle or the oral contraceptive pill.
Immunogenetics
• Associated with HLA-DR3 and DR4.
• C4 null alleles are increased

243

244

CHAPTER 10

Autoimmune skin disorders

Immunopathology
• Pathology shows the presence of eosinophils, which may be
accompanied by a peripheral blood eosinophilia.
• Staining on immuno-EM is localized to the epithelial lamina lucida.
• IIF is positive in only 30% of patients.
• Therefore biopsy with DIF is the diagnostic test of choice.
Autoantibodies
• Autoantigen is the 180kDa BPAg2 antigen (see ‘Bullous pemphigoid’,
p.242), and DIF shows linear deposits of C3 at the dermo-epidermal
junction in almost all cases, with IgG in up to 50%.
Treatment
• Treatment is with steroids (20-60mg/day) together with antihistamines
to control itch.
• This may pose problems for the pregnancy (increased incidence of
‘small for dates’) and careful monitoring is required.

Cicatricial pemphigoid
See Chapter 11.

Pemphigus vulgaris
Presentation
• Serious blistering disease which is invariably fatal if unrecognized and
untreated.
• Blisters are ﬂaccid and tend to rupture, with the split occurring in the
epidermis itself.
• Causes a characteristic sign (Nikolsky’s sign), where gentle lateral
pressure leads to sloughing of the skin in both the affected areas and
apparently normal areas.
• Blisters typically occur on the head and trunk and in the groin,
although no part of the skin is spared.
• Mucosal lesions are common, and the disease often presents with oral
involvement.

Immunogenetics
• The disease is more common in middle age and particularly in persons
of Jewish or Mediterranean extraction.
• Rarely, it may occur as a familial disease.
• Associated with HLA-A10 and also HLA-DR4/DQw3 (DRB1*0402) or
DR6/DQw1 (DQB1*0503).

Immunopathology
• Histology shows acantholysis or separation of the keratinocytes.
• DIF on skin biopsies shows the deposition of IgG and C3 in the
intercellular spaces of the epidermis, giving a chicken-wire appearance,
in almost all cases.
• IIF on monkey oesophagus gives a similar pattern in >90% of patients.
• Diagnosis requires both DIF on a suitable biopsy and IIF on serum.

PEMPHIGUS FOLIACEUS

• Low titres of serum antibodies giving a similar staining pattern have
been reported in SLE, myasthenia gravis with thymoma, burns, and
some cutaneous infections (leprosy).

Autoantibodies
• Autoantigen is now known to be a 130kDa protein identiﬁed as a
cadherin (Dsg3), which is homologous to desmoglein and occurs
complexed to plakoglobin.
• Some patients also have antibodies to desmoglein-1 (Dsg-1).
• Immune complex occurs at sites of adherence between neighbouring
keratinocytes.
• Complement plays a key role in the immune process and complement
breakdown products can be detected in blister ﬂuid.
• Local plasmin formation is also important in separation of the cells.
• A rare form of pemphigus, with a characteristic neutrophilic inﬁltrate,
has been described in which the antibody is IgA and the autoantigens
are desmocollin I and II, components of the desmosome.
• The DIF shows a chicken-wire staining pattern, located in the basal
layers only with anti-IgA antiserum.

Treatment
• Treatment is with high-dose corticosteroids (1-2mg/kg/day).
• Azathioprine is the preferred second-line agent, although
cyclophosphamide, ciclosporin, mycophenolate mofetil, and
methotrexate have all been used successfully.
• In the neutrophilic variant, dapsone is helpful because of its effects on
neutrophil activity.
• Plasmapheresis may be of beneﬁt when combined with other therapies
in refractory disease.
• hdIVIG and rituximab are valuable in resistant cases; early use of
rituximab may prevent the development of resistant disease.

Pemphigus foliaceus
• Rare variant of pemphigus vulgaris (PV) which rarely involves the
mucosal surfaces.
• Blistering is more superﬁcial than in PV, giving a better prognosis.
• Endemic form in Brazil (fogo selvagem) may be triggered by an
infectious agent, perhaps transmitted by an insect vector. This is
characterized unusually by an IgG4 autoantibody.
• May also be seen as a reaction to certain drugs (penicillamine,
captopril, and other ACE inhibitors). Drugs containing thio groups are
more likely to act as triggers.
• Increased incidence of HLA-DQ1, DR4; DR7 may confer resistance.
• DIF may show that the immunoﬂuorescence is more superﬁcial than in
PV.
• Autoantigen is different from that in PV and is a 160kDa component of
the desmosome, desmoglein-1 (a cadherin).
• Treatment is the same as for PV: antimalarials and oral gold may also
be useful.

245

246

CHAPTER 10

Autoimmune skin disorders

Paraneoplastic pemphigus
• A severe variant of pemphigus, accompanied by erythema multiforme
may occur in association with lymphomas, chronic lymphocytic
leukaemia, and thymoma.
• Pathology shows acantholysis with necrosis of the keratinocytes and
basement membrane damage.
• Involvement of the trachea and bronchi may occur with bronchiolitis
and respiratory failure.
• DIF shows IgG and C3 deposition, both in the intercellular substance
and along the basement membrane.
• Autoantigens are desmosomal proteins, desmoplakin I and II,
desmogleins 1 and 3, and possibly other antigens (230kDa BPAg1,
envoplakin, plectin, and periplakin).
• No effective treatment is known. Complete excision of tumour may
lead to slow recovery.
• Death occurs from respiratory failure and sepsis.

Epidermolysis bullosa acquisita
• A blistering disease accompanied by marked skin fragility affecting
particularly sites of trauma such as hands and feet.
• Associated with inﬂammatory bowel disease, especially Crohn’s
disease.
• Disease can often be difﬁcult to distinguish from other blistering
diseases.
• Increased prevalence of HLA-DR2.
• DIF shows linear staining with IgG and C3 of the basement membrane,
but this is not diagnostic.
• On split-skin preparations the antibody is seen to localize to the
dermal side.
• IIF may also be positive.
• Autoantibody appears to react with type VII procollagen.
• Treatment is difﬁcult and the response to steroids and cytotoxics is
poor.
• Plasmapheresis and hdIVIg may be more effective.

Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) and
linear IgA disease
Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH)
• DH is an intensely itchy blistering rash that is associated with gluten
intolerance.
• Typical sites for the rash are the elbows, buttocks, and thighs.
• Like coeliac disease, associated with increased risk of lymphoma.

ERYTHEMA MULTIFORME (EM)

• Increased incidence of HLA-A1/B8/DR3/DQw2 and associated organspeciﬁc autoimmune disease.
• DIF on the skin biopsy shows typical granular IgA deposits on the
dermal papillae.
• IgA endomysial or tissue transglutaminase antibodies will be positive.
• Jejunal/duodenal biopsies will often show features of coeliac disease
even in the absence of clinical symptoms.
• Gluten-free diet will eventually lead to resolution of the rash.
• Resistant cases may require treatment with dapsone, having ﬁrst
excluded G6PD deﬁciency (monitor all patients for haemolysis and
methaemoglobinaemia—see Chapter 16).
• Other drugs that may be used if dapsone is not tolerated: tetracycline,
colchicine, nicotinamide.

Linear IgA disease
• A group of rare blistering disorders also associated with IgA deposition
in the skin on DIF that are not associated with gluten intolerance.
• May be induced by vancomycin (antigen is type VII collagen).
• Rash is often similar to that of DH.
• DIF shows linear (rather than granular) IgA deposition along the
basement membrane, and a 97kDa antigen (LAD-1) has been identiﬁed
in most cases:
• antigen appears to be a domain of the BPAg2 antigen (180kDa).
• Treatment is with dapsone (with the caveats noted above).

Erythema multiforme (EM)
• Presents with rash (target lesions); usually self-limiting but may be
chronic.
• Can be triggered by infections:
• HSV, EBV, HIV, inﬂuenza—prophylaxis with aciclovir may be useful
if this is the cause
• mycoplasma, typhoid, streptococci
• fungal and protozoal infection.
• Can be triggered by drugs:
• sulphonamides
• penicillins
• allopurinol
• phenytoin
• tetracyclines
• barbiturates.
• Possible link to dietary benzoates:
• trial of benzoate-free diet may be helpful.
• Role of corticosteroids is uncertain.

247

248

CHAPTER 10

Autoimmune skin disorders

Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS); toxic
epidermal necrolysis (TEN)
• SJS is a milder form of TEN.
• Associated with fever, sore throat, mucosal ulceration, and
conjunctivitis.
• Triggered by infections and drugs as for EM.
• May be associated with lymphoma and GvHD.
• Drug-induced SJS more likely in patients with HIV, SLE, RhA, and Still’s
disease.
• Immunopathology: massive death of keratinocytes, excess CD8+ T
cells, and possible involvement of FasL.
• MHC link in some cases, mainly in oriental but not Caucasian
populations (HLA B15 (B75) with phenytoin or carbamazepine, or B58
with allopurinol).
• Corticosteroids may worsen disease.
• hdIVIg may be valuable (?blocking anti-Fas antibodies).
• Mortality is signiﬁcant.

Sweet’s syndrome (acute febrile
neutrophilic dermatosis)
• Acute onset of tender plaques associated with fever, arthritis,
conjunctivitis, and oral ulcers.
• Associated with autoimmune diseases (RhA), inﬂammatory bowel
disease, and acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), especially if G-CSF used
in treatment.
• May precede diagnosis of AML.
• 50% of cases associated with underlying systemic disease.
• Neutrophilia, i ESR and i alkaline phosphatase. Skin biopsy shows
mixed inﬁltrate of neutrophils and histiocytes and evidence of
vasculitis.
• Treat with corticosteroids, colchicine, or potassium iodide.
Alternatives include dapsone (check G6PD status), doxycycline,
clofazimine, and ciclosporin.

Lichen planus (LP)
• Chronic inﬂammatory condition that may also affect the oral mucosa.
• Associated with non-scaly papules and Whickam’s striae; other variants
exist. Usually itchy.
• Cause unknown.
• Associated with:
• other autoimmune conditions (alopecia, vitiligo, ulcerative colitis)
• hepatitis B, hepatitis C
• drugs (gold, penicillamine, B-blockers, thiazides, NSAIDs, and antiTNF agents)

PSORIASIS

• Treat with topical corticosteroids, tacrolimus; for severe disease
systemic steroids, ciclosporin, retinoids, and UVB are used.
• Oral LP increases risk of squamous cell carcinoma.
• For oral LP, worth patch testing for type IV reactions to metals (nickel)
and oral ﬂavourings (cinnamon). Trial of low-nickel diet and avoiding
cinnamon is worthwhile.

Alopecia areata
• Loss of hair that may be localized or generalized.
• T-cell mediated, with circulating IgG autoantibodies to anagen hair
follicles.
• May be triggered by stress.
• Strongly associated with autoimmune thyroid disease and other
endocrine autoimmune diseases. Often accompanied by vitiligo.
• Needs to be differentiated from telogen efﬂuvium, tinea capitis,
trichotillomania, drug-induced hair loss, SLE, and syphilis.
• Treated with intra-lesional corticostroids, topical steroids, and
ciclosporin or tacrolimus. Results of treatment are variable.
• Support for wigs etc. is essential if extensive.

Vitiligo
• Presents with patchy pigmentary loss, often starting in childhood or
early adulthood and progressive.
• Inﬂammatory destruction of melanocytes.
• Strongly associated with other autoimmune diseases:
• autoimmune endocrinopathies, pernicious anaemia, autoimmune
hepatitis, alopecia, psoriasis, LP, SLE, RhA, myasthenia gravis.
• Multiple susceptibility genes (at least 10, similar to other autoimmune
diseases), but especially alleles of the TYR gene.
• Strong family history.
• Treatment is difﬁcult: topical tacrolimus and PUVA or UVB may be
helpful.
• Melanocyte transplants have been used successfully.
• Teaching patients camouﬂage techniques is essential.

Psoriasis
• Chronic inﬂammatory skin disease presenting with scaly plaques
caused by hyperproliferation of keratinocytes.
• Complex immunopathology:
• inﬁltrate of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and increased cytokine
production by keratinocytes (γ-IFN, IL-2, IL-12, TNF-α). IL-22 and
IL-23 also increased, stimulating TH17 cells.

249

250

CHAPTER 10

Autoimmune skin disorders

• Associated with at least nine gene loci (PSOR1-9):
• strong family history (at least 30% have affected family members)
• HLA-Cw6 associated with early onset disease.
• shared genes with Crohn’s disease (increased incidence of Crohn’s
disease in psoriasis).
• Treated with PUVA, vitamin D3 analogues, oral retinoids,
methotrexate, ciclosporin, fumaric acid esters (monitor CD4+ T cells
as lymphopenia can be severe), hydroxycarbamide, leﬂunomide, and
anti-TNFs.

CHAPTER 11

Autoimmune eye disease

Overview
The eye has a number of interesting immunological properties which alter
the propensity for immune-mediated disease, including the curious feature
that antigen injected into the anterior chamber induces tolerance rather
than immunity. In addition, the eye has no true lymphatics, relatively poor
vascularity, and, as the retina is an extension of the CNS, there is a blood-
retinal barrier which limits passage of molecules in either direction. Ocular
involvement is a common feature of many connective tissue and vasculitic
diseases.

Uveitis
Causes
Uveitis occurs as a consequence of a wide range of systemic diseases. The
site of inﬂammation gives some clues as to the cause.
• Anterior uveitis:
• seronegative arthritis (ankylosing spondylitis, Reiter’s disease,
psoriatic arthropathy)
• infections (herpes simplex, herpes zoster, TB)
• idiopathic
• vasculitis (Behçet’s syndrome).
• Posterior uveitis:
• infections—mainly in immunocompromised (HIV, CMV, Candida,
other fungi, syphilis, Toxoplasma, TB)
• vasculitis (Behçet’s syndrome, polyarteritis)
• sarcoidosis
• rare eye diseases (Eales’ disease, VKH, birdshot retinopathy).
• Pan-uveitis:
• connective tissue diseases (polychondritis, SLE)
• infections (Brucella, Toxoplasma, TB, viruses)
• vasculitis (Behçet’s, Wegener’s)
• sympathetic ophthalmitis
• sarcoidosis.
• Intermediate uveitis:
• Fuchs heterochromic iridocyclitis (abnormal pigmentation of
the iris)
• pars planitis (may be associated with MS)
• juvenile rheumatoid arthritis.

Investigation (see Box 11.1)
• Investigations should be aimed at the most likely causes.
• Infection needs to be excluded, as the appropriate treatment for noninfectious uveitis is immunosuppression.

low-dose weekly methotrexate).
• Anti-TNF agents are being used in Behçet’s uveitis.
• Patients require regular monitoring of therapy (see Chapter 16).

Tubulointerstitial nephritis and uveitis
(TINU)
• Rare syndrome of nephritis with uveitis.
• Thought to be caused by autoantibodies against a modiﬁed CRP
(m-CRP).
• Cellular response (T cells) also involved.
• May be associated with other autoimmune diseases.
• Treated with steroids and second-line agents (mycophenolate mofetil).

253

254

CHAPTER 11

Autoimmune eye disease

Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease (VKH)
• Rare bilateral granulomatous pan-uveitis occurring in adults and leading
to visual failure.
• More common in Japan and South America.
• Similar to sympathetic ophthalmitis.
• Associated with vitiligo, alopecia, and poliosis.
• Strong HLA association with DR53.
• High titres of anti-retinal antibodies against the retinal S-antigen can be
detected.
• High levels of circulating G-IFN have been noted.
• Corticosteroids and ciclosporin are the recommended treatments.

Cancer-associated retinopathy and
uveitis
• Very rare paraneoplastic syndrome associated with small cell
carcinoma of the lung and also with melanoma.
• Associated with destruction of the photoreceptors.
• SCLC-associated retinopathy (CAR) presents with alterations of
visual acuity, scotomata, alterations in colour vision, progressive visual
dimming and night blindness.
• Melanoma-associated retinopathy (MAR) usually presents with suddenonset shimmering, ﬂickering, or pulsating photopsia, night-blindness;
may be unilateral
• Autoantibodies against the retina are detectable:
• anti-recoverin (CAR, with SCLC)
• anti-bipolar cells (MAR, with melanoma)—putative antigens include
arrestin and transducin
• anti-enolase antibodies associated with less severe retinopathy,
affecting cones
• at least 20 other autoantigens identiﬁed.
• Cancer-associated uveitis and optic neuritis may occur. Associated
with antibodies to CV2/CRMP5.
• Associated with SCLC, breast, renal, and thyroid cancer, thymoma.

Birdshot retinopathy
•
•
•
•

Rare primary uveitis with a retinal vasculitis.
Affects predominantly middle-aged Caucasian females.
Strongly associated with HLA-A29.
Treatment is with immunosuppressive agents, including steroids,
ciclosporin, azathioprine, and hdIVIg.

OCULAR CICATRICIAL PEMPHIGOID

Scleritis
Presentation
• Painful red eye.
• Evidence of scleral thinning (perforation in severe cases = necrotizing
scleritis).
• Must be distinguished from episcleritis, a mild self-limiting condition.

Immunopathology
• Vasculitis of scleral vessels.
• Associated with a range of autoimmune diseases:
• rheumatoid arthritis
• SLE
• Wegener’s granulomatosis
• ankylosing spondylitis
• inﬂammatory bowel disease
• polychondritis

Treatment
•
•
•
•

Treatment should be supervised by an ophthalmologist.
NSAIDs—topical and systemic.
Topical and systemic corticosteroids.
Steroid-sparing immunosuppressive drugs.

Ocular cicatricial pemphigoid
Presentation
• Causes subepithelial ﬁbrosis of conjunctivae and, if untreated, can
cause blindness through damage to the corneal surface.
• The mouth is also involved, giving a gingivitis and ulceration. Rarely,
this may also spread to involve the larynx and oesophagus.
• Rarely, there is also skin disease.

Immunogenetics
• There is an association with HLA-DQ7 (DQB*0301) and B11.

Autoantibodies
• Autoantibodies to a 120kDa basement membrane antigen can be
detected.
• On direct immunoﬂuorescence antibodies are found as continuous
linear staining at the epithelial basement membrane, located on
immuno-EM to the lamina lucida.
• IgG, IgA, and complement are deposited.
• Circulating epithelial antibodies are rarely present. Studies claiming to
detect them have used neat serum, which is likely to give meaningless
results.

255

256

CHAPTER 11

Autoimmune eye disease

• Putative antigens include epiligrin (a ligand for keratinocyte integrins)
and an unidentiﬁed45 kDa protein.
• Where the skin is involved, antibodies to BPAg1 and BPAg2 have been
detected (see Chapter 10, ‘Bullous pemphigoid’, p.242).

Treatment
• Topical therapy is rarely effective and oral steroids, cyclophosphamide,
or dapsone will be required
• Drug-induced pemphigoid has been associated with pilocarpine,
ephedrine, and idoxuridine.

Sympathetic ophthalmitis
• Syndrome occurs following penetrating trauma to one eye, which
is then followed by a progressive granulomatous pan-uveitis in the
uninjured eye after a variable interval.
• It is thought that damage to the uveal tract triggers an autoimmune
response. Autoantibodies to retinal photoreceptors and Müller cells
(normally responsible for nutritional support for the photoreceptor)
may be detected.
• One of the major autoantigens is the retinal S-antigen (arrestin).
• It may also be associated with lens-associated uveitis, although the
latter may occur alone and can be cured by lens removal.
• Vitiligo, alopecia, and whitening of the eyelashes (poliosis) may occur.
• Early removal of the traumatized eye and aggressive
immunosuppressive therapy may be required.

Idiopathic orbital inﬂammation
(orbital pseudo-tumour)
• Rare disease of the orbit; no clear aetiology.
• Said to be ‘benign’, but may cause serious visual problems. 10%
associated with other autoimmune disease:
• Crohn’s disease
• SLE
• rheumatoid arthritis
• myasthenia gravis
• diabetes mellitus.
• Causes chemosis, ptosis, and optic neuropathy.
• Responds to corticosteroids. Cyclophosphamide, ciclosporin, and
methotrexate may also be required as steroid-sparing agents.
Relapse may occur after successful treatment.

CHAPTER 12

Connective tissue disease

Rheumatoid arthritis: aetiology, clinical
features, and immunopathology
Aetiology
• RhA is a multisystem disease in which arthritis is a major component.
• An infectious trigger has been sought for many years, without success.
• The best candidate pathogens are:
• EBV
• Mycobacterium tuberculosis
• Proteus mirabilis.
• The genetic background includes:
• DR4 (DRB1*0401), DR1 (DRB1*0101) in Caucasians
• DR10 (DRB1*1001) in Spanish and Italian patients
• DR9 (DRB1*0901) in Chileans DR3 (DRB1*0301) in Arabs
• Tcr, TNFA, IL-10, and IgG polymorphisms
• PTPN22.

Clinical features
• Early clinical signs:
• morning stiffness;
• fatigue.
• There may be low-grade fever.
• Joint pain and swelling follow and the arthritis is often deforming. Hand
joints are typically affected. Radiographic changes are typical.
• Non-articular features include:
• Sjögren’s syndrome
• lymphadenopathy
• scleritis
• cutaneous vasculitis and ulceration
• nodules of both skin and lung
• pleurisy, alveolitis
• pericarditis, endocarditis (with valvular involvement)
• splenomegaly (with ulceration and neutropenia = Felty’s syndrome
(see Table 12.1))
• myositis, mononeuritis multiplex, and cord compression from spinal
involvement.
• Amyloid is a long-term complication from chronic inﬂammation
(p.338).

Immunopathology
• Most of the pathology is located in the joint:
• activation of T cells, macrophages, and endothelial cells
• increased synovial vascularity
• both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells are found in the joint tissues
• ‘memory’ T cells (CD45RO+, CD29+) predominate
• restriction of Tcr VB usage suggestive of a superantigenic effect.
• Large quantities of cytokines can be detected in the joint ﬂuids.

• Endothelial cell activation/production of chemokines is responsible for
inﬂux of inﬂammatory cells:
• interleukin-8 (IL-8)
• RANTES
• MCP-1
• Gro-A
• ENA-78 (epithelial neutrophil activating peptide).
• Autoantibodies are produced, including:
• rheumatoid factors
• anti-nuclear antibodies including anti-neutrophil nuclear antibodies
• anti-keratin
• anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP)
• anti-calpastatin
• anti-Sa (unknown antigen)
• anti-ﬁlaggrin.
• Pathogenic role of these autoantibodies is uncertain.
• IgG molecules in RhA have been shown to have markedly reduced
glycosylation, although the signiﬁcance of this is uncertain.
• Complement activation takes place, releasing anaphylotoxins,
C3a, C5a.

CHAPTER 12

Connective tissue disease

Rheumatoid arthritis: immunological
tests, treatment, and childhood RhA
Immunological tests (see Box 12.1)
• Rheumatoid factors (RhF) are found in 67-85% of patients, depending
on the type of assay used.
• Most detected rheumatoid factors are IgM class.
• RhF- patients may have RhF of other immunoglobulin classes, not
detected by standard assays.
• Rheumatoid factors are not diagnostic tests for RhA (see Part 2).
• Highest titres of RhF are found in patients with extra-articular
disease.
• There is no correlation of disease activity with antibody titres.
• Detection of RhF is of most value when the diagnosis of RhA has
been made
• Anti-CCP antibodies are valuable, as a more speciﬁc marker, in
identiﬁcation of early disease.
• Antibodies to ﬁlaggrin and keratin have also been said to be more
speciﬁc for RhA. Assays are not widely available.
• Cryoglobulins may be found, usually type II or type III (i.e. with RhF
activity), often in association with Felty’s syndrome.
• Hypergammaglobulinaemia due to chronic inﬂammation is usually
present and is invariably polyclonal, although small monoclonal bands
may be present.
• Urine may contain an excess of free polyclonal and sometimes
monoclonal light chains.
• Complement C3/C4 are usually elevated, as are acute-phase proteins,
although patients with Felty’s syndrome may have reduced levels.
• ANAs may be found on both rat liver and HEp-2 cells. ANAs are most
commonly found in Felty’s syndrome. These include antibodies against:
• nuclear antigen RA-33, a ribonucleoprotein of the splicesome
• rheumatoid-associated nuclear antibodies (RANA) against an
antigen which is present in high levels in EBV-transformed cell lines
(this antibody is also found in SLE and MCTD patients).
• Antibodies are also detected against granulocyte nuclei (GS-ANA),
which may be difﬁcult to distinguish from P-ANCA when testing is
done by ﬂuorescence; these are also associated most strongly with
Felty’s syndrome.
• True P-ANCA may be found in RhA vasculitis.
• Associated Sjögren’s syndrome will be accompanied by the presence
of antibodies to Ro and/or La.
• In active disease, both CRP and ESR will be elevated.
• CRP is the most sensitive marker of activity because of its wide
dynamic range, and is the most useful marker to monitor response to
treatment.

these are used routinely yet.
• Monitoring of cytokines is not used routinely.
• Anaemia of chronic disease is often present and there may be
lymphopenia (both CD4+ and CD8+ cells).

Treatment
• Proper supportive care (physiotherapy, occupational therapy) is
essential.
• Drug therapy includes NSAIDs, usually with gastric protection, and
analgesics as ﬁrst line.
• Low-dose corticosteroids are now back in favour to slow the
progression of erosive disease (prednisolone 5-7.5mg/day).
• Disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) (see Chapter 16)
include:
• sulfasalazine
• gold salts (interferes with TNF production)
• penicillamine
• methotrexate (low dose weekly)
• hydroxychloroquine (interferes with TNF production)
• azathioprine
• leﬂunomide
• ciclosporin and tacrolimus have been used to reduce the activation
of CD4+ T cells.
• Immunotherapies with biological agents include:
• anti-CD4 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs)
• anti-CD52 mAbs
• anti-TNF agents (adalimumab, inﬂiximab, etanercept, certolizumab,
golimumab) are highly effective

261

262

CHAPTER 12

Connective tissue disease

• IL-1 receptor antagonist (anakinra) seems less effective and has not
been endorsed by NICE
• rituximab (anti-CD20.
• humanized anti-IL-6 receptor (tocilizumab)
• Other agents undergoing trials include:
• oral anti-TNF drugs
• humanized anti-IL-6 receptor (tocilizumab)
• CTLA4-Ig (abatacept)
• anti-CD2
• anti-IL-15
• anti-IL-12
• anti-B-lymphocyte stimulator protein (BLys) (belimumab);
• Problems with all mAb-based therapies have included:
• high levels of reactions to xenogeneic proteins, even if attempts
have been made to humanize the antibodies
• severe and persistent T-cell lymphopenia in some trials, raising
concerns over risks of opportunist infections.
• Surgical replacement of damaged joints may restore function and
relieve pain.

Childhood rheumatoid arthritis
• Childhood-onset seropositive RhA is rare and usually presents with
general malaise and polyarthritis of the small joints of the hands and
feet.
• Because of the frequent appearance of RhF following infection,
European guidance suggests that three positive tests over a 3-month
period are required to conﬁrm the diagnosis although, bearing in mind
the half-life of the antibodies, this is probably too short an interval.
• This disease is associated with DR4.
• Diagnosis and management are as for the adult disease.
• An RhF-negative polyarthritis is also seen in children and may be
severe. It is associated with DR5 and DR8.

Juvenile chronic arthritis (JCA) and
Still’s disease
Clinically JCA is divided into two types: pauci-articular and systemic forms.
The latter is usually referred to as Still’s disease.

Aetiology and immunopathology
• As with many connective tissue diseases (CTDs), the aetiology is not
well understood.
• The immunogenetics of pauci-articular disease is complex: DR8 and
DR5 show the strongest correlation with pauci-articular disease. Other
genes include DPB1 and A2.
• Rubella virus has been implicated as a possible trigger.
• Systemic disease is also associated most strongly with DR5 and DR8,
but also with DR4.

JUVENILE CHRONIC ARTHRITIS (JCA) AND STILL’S DISEASE

Clinical features
• Clinical diagnosis of pauci-articular disease is one of exclusion.
• Usual age of onset is 1-3 years, with a 4:1 female predominance.
• Systemic features are an exclusion, and the usual features are those
of painful or painless swelling of one or two joints.
• Uveitis may develop and regular screening is required when ANAs
are detected.
• Still’s disease typically has a high spiking fever, accompanied by malaise
and rigors.
• A pale, salmon-pink rash that comes and goes is usual, in parallel
with the spikes of fever.
• Hepatosplenomegaly and generalized lymphadenopathy are usually
present.
• There is polyarthralgia and polyarthritis.
• Pericarditis and pleurisy are also common.
• A rare macrophage-activation syndrome has been described, with
encephalopathy, hepatitis, disseminated intravascular coagulation
(DIC), and haemophagocytosis.
• Amyloid may be a long-term complication.

Immunological tests (see Box 12.2)
• Rheumatoid factor is rare (<5%) in pauci-articular disease and, when
present, suggests that the course will be that of juvenile RhA with
polyarticular disease.
• ANAs are frequently present, and it is important to ensure that
the normal range for signiﬁcance is appropriately adjusted for the
paediatric population:
• in small children, titres of 1/10 and 1/20 are highly signiﬁcant,
whereas such titres would not be considered important
in adults.
• High incidence of uveitis in female patients with arthritis and positive
ANA, especially if also anti-Ro+.
• Antibodies to histones H1 and H3 are also associated with uveitis.
• Antibodies to retinal S-antigen may also be found (in 30%).
• Other antibodies detected include anti-histone antibodies (often in
those without uveitis).
• Detection of anti-dsDNA antibodies should lead to consideration of
childhood lupus.
• Frequent evidence of complement consumption with raised C3d, even
when C3 levels are within the normal range.
• Acute-phase proteins are minimally elevated.
• High ESR should prompt a search for other causes, including leukaemia
and infection.
0 It is important to realize that the development of diagnostically helpful
antibodies often follows rather than precedes the development of
clinical disease. Therefore repeating antibody measurements every
3 months is advised if there is strong clinical suspicion of disease.

263

264

CHAPTER 12

Connective tissue disease

• In Still’s disease, there are no speciﬁc tests. ESR and CRP are very high,
with anaemia, leucocytosis, and thrombocytosis.
• There is a polyclonal hypergammaglobulinaemia, although the
incidence of IgA deﬁciency is increased.
• A small proportion of patients may have RhF and a larger
proportion may have ANA (37%).
• Complement activation may be present.
• IL-6 and TNFA levels may be elevated.

Treatment
• NSAIDs form the mainstay of therapy for pauci-articular disease,
notwithstanding the risks of Reye’s syndrome.
• DMARDs may be required for more severe cases.
• Uveitis may be treated with etanercept, methotrexate, or
mycophenolate mofetil.
• Biological agents and experimental therapies as for RhA are also used.
• In Still’s disease, NSAIDs are used initially, with steroids reserved for
failure of response. Methotrexate is the most effective steroid-sparing
agent; gold and sulfasalazine are contraindicated.
• Bone marrow and stem-cell transplantation are now being used
successfully for severe cases.

Adult Still’s disease
• Clinical features are very similar to those of childhood Still’s disease,
but occur in young adults.
• There is the typical fever (for more than a week) and rash
(evanescent salmon-pink), often accompanied by sore throat.
• Hepatosplenomegaly and lymphadenopathy are common.
• Polyserositis occurs frequently.
• Polyarthralgia or polyarthritis lasting >2 weeks.

ANKYLOSING SPONDYLITIS

• Exclusion of lymphoma may be difﬁcult.
• May be complicated by haemophagocytosis (macrophage activation
syndrome).
• There are no diagnostic tests other than non-speciﬁc inﬂammatory
markers.
• Neutrophilia is common.
• RhF and ANA will be negative.
• Ferritin levels may be exceptionally high and disproportionately
elevated when compared with other acute-phase markers.
• Ferritin levels are controlled by IL-18, and a polymorphism in the
IL-18 gene which may explain the high ferritin has been identiﬁed in
adult Still’s patients.
• Hyperferritinaemia may be seen if haemaphagocytosis is present
and may also be found in other haemophagocytic syndromes.
• NSAIDs, corticosteroids, and DMARDS are all required.
• 0NSAIDS have a risk of inducing hepatitis and possibly of triggering
haemophagocytosis.
• Regular monitoring of LFTs is required.
• Good response to anti-IL-1 therapies; methotrexate is also valuable.
• Role of anti-TNF therapies is unclear: some may beneﬁt.
• Ciclosporin may be beneﬁcial if there is macrophage activation
syndrome.
• Disease may run a chronic progressive course, a relapsing-remitting
course, or resolve completely.

Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and related
spondyloarthropathies
These are a group of seronegative (RhF negative) disorders, strongly associated with HLA-B27. The group includes ankylosing spondylitis, reactive
arthritis, enteropathic arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, and undifferentiated
spondyloarthritis.

Clinical features
• Typical clinical features of AS include spinal pain and restriction in
movement, especially in the lumbar and thoracic regions, accompanied
by demonstrable sacroiliitis on radiographs.
• More common in men than in women.
• May be associated with inﬂammatory bowel disease.
• Complications include:
• anterior uveitis
• cardiac lesions involving the proximal aorta and aortic valve
• pericarditis and conduction block
• upper-lobe lung ﬁbrosis.

Immunopathology
• TNFA appears to play a key role: levels are high in affected joints,
which are inﬁltrated with CD4+ and CD8+ T cells.

265

266

CHAPTER 12

Connective tissue disease

• IL-6 levels are also elevated.
• HLA B27 is critical for the development of disease: B27 transgenic
mice develop spontaneous spondylitis.
• Bacterial infections (especially bowel bacteria) are strongly associated.
• Autoantibodies have been identiﬁed to aggrecan (a proteoglycan
in cartilage) and heat shock proteins—these are not diagnostically
valuable.

Diagnosis
• By deﬁnition, this is an RhF-seronegative arthritis and there are no
deﬁning antibodies.
• Acute-phase proteins may be normal or elevated.
• IgA is often elevated.
• Alkaline phosphatase and creatinine kinase (CK) may also be elevated.
• More than 90% of all cases will be HLA-B27 positive but, as this is a
common antigen in the Caucasian population (8%), the diagnostic value
of testing for HLA-B27 is limited.
• 5-10% of B27-positive persons will develop AS, while 20% go on to
develop a reactive arthropathy after infection with agents such as
Salmonella or Chlamydia.
• DR4 is associated with peripheral joint involvement.

Treatment
• Previously the mainstay of treatment has been NSAIDs (with exercise
and physiotherapy), sulphasalazine, and methotrexate.
• AS responds dramatically well to anti-TNF drugs (etanercept,
inﬂiximab, adalimumab, golimumab), although the associated uveitis
responds less well and may need other immunosupressive agents.
• Tocilizumab (anti-IL-6R) and rituximab (anti-CD20) are also useful.
• Other beneﬁcial therapies include bisphosphonates and thalidomide.

Complications

• Amyloid may develop and there is a recognized association with IgA
nephropathy.

SAPHO syndrome
• A syndrome of synovitis, acne, palmoplantar pustulosis, hyperostosis,
and osteitis (with granulomata).
• Acne is severe.
• Hidradenitis suppurativa is also seen.
• Hyperostosis of especially the sternoclavicular joint and spine.
• Peripheral arthritis is seen in 92% of cases.
• ESR is high.
• There is a weak association with HLA-B27.
• May respond to anti-TNF treatment and antibiotics (as used for acne
on the basis that Propionobacterium acnes has been isolated from bone
biopsies).
• Bisphosphonates have also been used successfully.

PSORIATIC ARTHRITIS

Psoriatic arthritis
Clinical features
• Usually develops in patients with clinical psoriasis although, if skin
lesions are not present, diagnosis may be difﬁcult.
• Arthritis is frequently asymmetrical and spinal involvement is common,
in contrast with RhA, which it most resembles.

Immunopathology
•
•
•
•
•

Disease is associated with HLA-B7 and B27.
DR4 is linked with a peripheral arthritis.
A gene has also been identiﬁed on chromosome 17.
Retroviral-like particles have been described in psoriasis.
There is a direct association of guttate psoriasis with streptococcal
infections.
• Major pathological process is overgrowth of keratinocytes, driven
primarily by activated CD4+ T cells and the resultant release of
cytokines and growth factors.
• Psoriasis is associated with HLA Cw6 (also DR7, DQ3, and B57); B27
is associated with spondylitis.

Diagnosis
• There are no speciﬁc immunological tests for psoriatic arthropathy.
• Up to 10% of patients will be RhF positive (low titre) and may also
have low-titre ANA and autoantibodies against skin antigens.
• There is polyclonal hypergammaglobulinaemia.
• Acute-phase proteins are elevated.
• Anaemia is common and may be due to both chronic disease and
folate deﬁciency from increased cell proliferation.
• Increased cell turnover may cause hyperuricaemia and gout.

Treatment
• The realization of the central role of T lymphocytes in psoriasis has led
to a change in the approach to treatment towards immunomodulation.
• Anti-TNF agents are extremely effective.
• 0 Care must be taken as some NSAIDs and antimalarials may
exacerbate psoriasis.
• Gold, penicillamine, hydroxychloroquine, methotrexate, sulfasaline,
azathioprine, ciclosporin, PUVA, and retinoids have all been shown to
be useful.

267

268

CHAPTER 12

Connective tissue disease

Reactive arthritis (including Reiter’s
syndrome)
Clinical features
This group of diseases presents with a pauci-articular large-joint arthritis,
accompanied by back pain (sacroiliitis) and non-articular symptoms:
• balanitis, urethritis, and cervicitis
• keratoderma blennorrhagicum
• pericarditis (with a long PR interval and non-speciﬁc T-wave changes)
• conjunctivitis.

Immunopathology
• Symptoms can be triggered by a variety of urogenital and intestinal
infections, including Shigella, Salmonella, Campylobacter, Yersinia,
Klebsiella, Proteus, Escherichia coli, Chlamydia, Mycoplasma, and
Ureaplasma.
• Also associated with inﬂammatory bowel disease and HIV infection.
• 55% of cases will be HLA-B27+, but most of these will be patients with
spinal involvement.

Diagnosis
• ESR/CRP will be elevated and there is anaemia and leucocytosis.
• RhF and ANA will be absent. Atypical P-ANCA may be seen where
there is inﬂammatory bowel disease.

Treatment
• Standard treatment is with NSAIDs, together with treatment of the
underlying infection or bowel disease.
• Variable response to anti-TNF agents.

Bowel disease and arthritis
Other bowel diseases that are associated with arthritis include the
following.
• Coeliac disease (check IgA endomysial antibodies/tissue
transglutaminase antibodies), which responds promptly to a gluten-free
diet.
• Intestinal bypass surgery/bacterial overgrowth (cryoglobulins may be
present, and there may be cutaneous vasculitic lesions).
• Whipple’s disease due to infection with Tropheryma whippelii
(malabsorption with migratory arthritis; no speciﬁc tests apart from
PCR-based detection of organism but hypogammaglobulinaemia may
occur—see Chapter 7).

SYSTEMIC LUPUS ERYTHEMATOSUS (SLE) AND VARIANTS

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)
and variants
SLE has taken over from syphilis as the great mimic. Clinical criteria have
been deﬁned by the American Rheumatism Association (ARA): 4 out of 11
criteria are sufﬁcient to conﬁrm the diagnosis (within a window of observation, not necessarily concurrently). However, many patients clearly have
the disease even though they do not ﬁt the criteria. SLE is strongly associated with other autoimmune diseases through a shared immunogenetic
background.

Aetiology and immunopathology
• There is a strong multigenic background to SLE. The main contributing
factors are as follows.
• Homozygous complement deﬁciency (especially C1qrs, C2, C4
deﬁciency).
• TREX1 deﬁciency (X-linked gene): endothelial function gene.
• HLA-A1, B8, DR3, other HLA genes associated with speciﬁc
features and/or autoantibodies (DQw1, DQw2 with anti-Ro; DR2,
anti-Sm. DQw6, 7, 8 with anti-phospholipid antibodies).
• Multiple immune genes (STAT4, ITF5, IRAK1, PTPN22, OX40L
among others).
• Racial background (especially West Indian).
• Female sex (M:F = 1:10-20).
• Men with Klinefelter’s syndrome are at increased risk of SLE.
• Mothers of boys with X-linked chronic granulomatous disease are
at increased risk of lupus.
• The precise cause of lupus is unknown, although a mouse model is
known to be deﬁcient in mechanisms for controlling lymphocyte
apoptosis (fas).
• Drugs may also trigger lupus, although the association for some of
these is weak.
• The likelihood of a drug causing problems is associated with
acetylator status (slow acetylator status increases the risk).
• SLE is the prototype immune complex disease, with evidence for
incorrectly sized immune complexes being formed that are cleared
inefﬁciently, in part due to an acquired reduction in the CR1 receptor
on erythrocytes.
• Many antibodies thought to be non-pathogenic are now known to be
able to penetrate viable cells and interfere with an intracellular target
enzyme. These include:
• anti-dsDNA
• anti-RNP
• anti-ribosomal P antibodies.
• This process is trypsin-sensitive.
• Surface DNA-binding proteins and proteins with a similar structure
to DNA will also bind anti-DNA antibodies and this may lead to
alterations in cell function.

269

270

CHAPTER 12

Connective tissue disease

• There is evidence of complement consumption, the level of which
corresponds to disease activity.
• FcgRIIA polymorphisms that reduce immune complex binding are
associated with lupus nephritis.
• Environmental factors contribute (e.g. UV-induced Ro antigen
expression on keratinocytes, smoking, EBV exposure, silica exposure).

Clinical features (see Table 12.2)
• There is no typical presentation and the disease may present to any
organ specialist (see Table 12.2).
• Any age group may be affected, but it is most common in younger
women.
• Fatigue, malaise, and weight loss are often marked in the prodrome.
• Lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly are common.
• Presentations with skin disease alone are of a more limited disease
(which may progress), discoid lupus, and subacute cutaneous lupus.
• C2-deﬁcient lupus tends to give a very ﬂorid disease with marked
cutaneous vasculitic symptoms and is invariably anti-Ro positive.
• Arthritis with recurrent polyserositis is a common presentation.
• A high index of suspicion for the disease is required.
• Disease may be triggered by stress and by UV light (in patients who
are photosensitive). The latter not only causes worsening of skin
disease but also sets off systemic manifestations.
• Infection may also trigger ﬂares, but the role of immunization is more
controversial.
• As the disease often affects young women, pregnancy is a frequent
problem.
• The effect of SLE on pregnancy is unpredictable.
• Conception is unlikely with severe active disease.
• Disease may ﬂare or remit during pregnancy.
• Disease frequently ﬂares post-partum (owing to sudden hormonal
changes).
• As autoantibodies are invariably IgG, they cross the placenta. Anti-Ro
and possibly anti-La have been associated with the following.
• Congenital complete heart block due to damage to the fetal
conducting system.
• Neonatal lupus that disappears as maternal antibody is removed
from the circulation.
• Complete heart block occurs in the children of 1 in 20 women
positive for the antibodies, but if there has been a previously
affected baby the risk rises to 1 in 4.

CHAPTER 12

Connective tissue disease

SLE: immunological testing
• Detection of autoantibodies and complement abnormalities form the
mainstay of diagnosis.
• Full diagnostic screen must include:
• ANA, dsDNA, ENA, HEp-2 cells (for proliferating cell nuclear
antigen (PCNA) and staining pattern)
• anti-cardiolipin ± anti-B2GP-I, lupus anticoagulant
• organ-speciﬁc autoantibodies (thyroid, gastric parietal cells, DCT,
others as clinically indicated)
• C3/C4
• C2, particularly if atypical skin disease
• serum immunoglobulins and electrophoresis
• cryoglobulins if Raynaud’s is present.

Autoantibody testing
• Antibodies to histones if drug-induced lupus is suspected.
• Other antibodies may be sought, depending on clinical features (see
Table 12.2).
• Pattern of ANAs detected (on HEp2 cells) may give a clue as to other
antibodies present (e.g. coarse speckled = anti-RNP), and should
always be reported. Homogeneous ANAs are usually associated with
antibodies to dsDNA and histones.
• Multiple speciﬁcities may be present in a single patient.
• A proportion of SLE patients have always been noted to be ANA
negative: these patients are usually anti-Ro positive.
• Rodent liver, widely used as a substrate for detecting ANA, has
low levels of Ro antigen which may be leached out during the test
procedure.
• HEp-2 cells have much higher levels of Ro antigen, so the
proportion of ANA-negative lupus falls when this substrate is used
for screening.
• HEp-2 cells also allow the detection of PCNA (see Part 2), another
SLE-speciﬁc antibody.
• Anti-Ku antibodies may be seen (but are also seen in
other CTDs).
• Antibodies to dsDNA should be checked regardless of the ANA result
if SLE is suspected.
• Certain subsets of dsDNA antibodies (not routinely
measurable) appear to be speciﬁcally associated with
glomerulonephritis.
• Additional antibodies detected on ENA screening give further useful
information.
• Anti-Sm is a rare antibody that is highly speciﬁc for SLE and is found
mostly in West Indians.
• Anti-RNP may be found in SLE, but always with dsDNA
(if anti-RNP is the only speciﬁcity, then MCTD is more likely;
see ‘Mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD)’, p.283).

SLE: IMMUNOLOGICAL TESTING

•
•
•
•
•
•

• Anti-Ro and anti-La are associated with features of secondary
sicca syndrome, as well as with congenital complete heart block,
neonatal lupus, and photosensitivity.
• Ribosomal antibodies will be detected when a multiblock section
is used.
Anti-C1q antibodies appear to be associated with lupus nephritis, as
well as with urticarial vasculitis.
ANCA may also be found in SLE, although it is difﬁcult to identify
these accurately in the presence of high-titre ANA. Solid-phase assays
with speciﬁc antigens (PR3 and MPO) help here.
Antibodies to lipoprotein lipase have been associated with the
pathogenesis of lupus nephritis (in association with antibodies to
dsDNA and ribosomal P antigen).
Rheumatoid factors are usually present but contribute little to the
diagnostic process.
For investigation of anti-phospholipid antibodies, see ‘Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS)’, p.294.
0 Severe difﬁculties in diagnosis may occur as ANAs may frequently
be found in chronic infection, including bacterial endocarditis and
particularly infection with enteric organisms, and in association with
drugs—phenothiazines, ACE inhibitors, minocycline (see ‘Druginduced lupus (DRL)’, p.278).

Complement studies
• Complement studies are essential.
• C4 reductions are common and do not reliably relate to disease
activity, as C4 null alleles are common.
• When disease is quiescent, the following rule of thumb applies.
• Complete C4 deﬁciency—no detectable C4
• One functioning allele—C4 is half the lower limit of normal
• Two functioning alleles—C4 is at or just below the lower limit of
normal
• Three functioning alleles—C4 is midway into the normal range.
• C3 levels are reduced in active disease although, because of an acutephase response with increased synthesis, the level may not drop below
the lower end of the normal range.
• A measure of C3 breakdown is required (C3d), but suitable assays for
routine diagnostic laboratories are now limited.
• Measuring haemolytic complement as a monitor of disease activity is
too crude and is not recommended.
• Measurement of haemolytic complement is essential when SLE is
thought to be due to a complete deﬁciency, and this testing should
always be followed up with measurement of individual components.
• Genetic testing for deﬁciency may be required.
• Assays of immune complexes are difﬁcult (impossible?) to standardize
and add little to the management.
• Rare patients with acquired angioedema may have antibodies to C1q
or C1 inhibitor.

CHAPTER 12

Connective tissue disease

Biopsies (‘lupus band test’)
• Skin biopsies show typical deposits of IgG and C3/C4 along the dermoepidermal junction in a ‘lumpy-bumpy’ distribution. There may also be
deposits around cutaneous blood vessels. Both normal and affected
skin show similar ﬁndings (this is used to form the ‘lupus band test’).
• Renal biopsy may be helpful in view of the wide range of
histopathological abnormalities that may be identiﬁed.

Immunoglobulin abnormalities
• Serum immunoglobulins are normally increased polyclonally; small
monoclonal bands on a polyclonal background may be seen on
electrophoresis.
• Electrophoresis of serum may show a reduction in the B-region due
to low C3 and a reduced albumin, and a raised A2-band will be seen if
there is a nephrotic syndrome.
• IgA deﬁciency is common in SLE, and rare patients may be panhypogammaglobulinaemic (distinct from hypogammaglobulinaemia
secondary to aggressive immunotherapy).
• Cryoglobulins, if present, will be type II or type III.

Acute phase response
• ESR is raised in active disease but, paradoxically, CRP is either normal
or only trivially raised.
• High CRPs in patients with SLE suggest intercurrent infection (which
may be hard to distinguish from a ﬂare).

Other tests
• FBC should be scanned for evidence of haemolysis (reduced Hb,
increased MCV, conﬁrmed by low/absent haptoglobin and positive
DCT), thrombocytopenia, and other cytopenias.
• Regular monitoring of creatinine and electrolytes, LFTs, TFTs, and
urine (casts, red cells, protein) are all essential.
• Imaging is essential to conﬁrm organ-speciﬁc problems, and MRI is
particularly valuable.

Monitoring of established disease
• Monitoring of lupus patients must include:
• regular FBC
• Cr&E
• LFTs
• TFTs
• urine (protein , blood, casts)
• CRP/ESR
• C3/C4.
• anti-dsDNA—a rising titre of dsDNA often heralds relapse.
• Complement studies and acute-phase markers give an indicator of
current activity, although this must always be interpreted in the light of
clinical symptoms.
• There is no value in monitoring ANA titres.

SLE: TREATMENT AND PAEDIATRIC SLE

• Frequency of monitoring depends on disease activity and the type of
drugs being used (i.e. more frequent when cytotoxics are being used).
• It is worth rechecking full serology every so often (every 6-12 months)
as antibodies may come and go, and the clinical disease pattern may
evolve or change in parallel.
• As the half-life of antibodies is about 3 weeks, measurements of
autoantibodies are rarely of value more frequently than monthly
(unless a patient is being plasmapheresed).

SLE: treatment and paediatric SLE
Treatment
0Treatment protocols change regularly as new drugs are introduced:
readers are recommended to check up-to-date literature.
• Mild disease can usually be managed with NSAIDs, although there
are reports that patients with SLE are more prone to develop hepatic
abnormalities and aseptic meningitis.
• Rashes can be treated with topical steroids.
• Sunblocks are essential in sunny climes.
• Fatigue, arthralgia, and skin disease respond well to antimalarials:
hydroxychloroquine is the safest. Mepacrine is an alternative (beware
skin discoloration).
• Systemic disease usually responds to low-dose steroids (20-30mg/day).
Azathioprine (2-4mg/kg daily—check TPMT level ﬁrst) can be used as
a steroid-sparing agent.
• Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) is an alternative to azathioprine (and is
valuable where there is renal disease).
• Methotrexate (weekly oral or SC) is now being used for arthritis.
• More serious organ involvement (e.g. glomerulonephritis, haemolytic
anaemia) requires aggressive therapy with pulsed IV steroid with IV
(5-10mg/kg/pulse) or oral (2-4mg/kg daily) cyclophosphamide.
• 0High-dose cyclophosphamide requires the concomitant use of
mesna to prevent haemorrhagic cystitis.
• Neurological involvement is difﬁcult to treat and there is no
consensus. High-dose steroids can be tried but may be more likely to
trigger a steroid psychosis. The role of cytotoxics is uncertain.
• Plasmapheresis may be an adjunct in severe disease while waiting for a
clinical effect from cytotoxics, but should not be used alone because of
potential rebound worsening of the disease.
• In pregnancy, if possible avoid drugs other than prednisolone
(metabolized by placenta).
• Dexamethasone can be used to treat fetal complications (heart
block) in utero as it is not metabolized by the placenta.
• Hydroxychloroquine may increase risks of cochlear and retinal damage.
• IVIg should be used only with care as it may make the immune
complex component of the disease worse (contraindicated if there
is a high-titre RhF, renal impairment (high dose)).

275

276

CHAPTER 12

Connective tissue disease

• Aim should always be for the lowest dose of treatment compatible
with maintaining remission.
• Immune ablation with stem cell transplantation has been used for
severe disease in adults and children.

Use of biological agents
• Belimumab (humanised MAb that inhibits B-lymphocyte stimulator
BLys) approved by FDA in SLE
• Rituximab (anti-CD20), in combination with corticosteroids and
cyclophosphamide has been used in refractory disease
• Progressive multiﬁocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) may be a risk
• Rituximab alone seems to be disappointing
• Other anti-B cell agents are undergoing trials
• Atacicept: fusion protein of TACI and IgG (appears to signiﬁcantly
increase risk of infection if given with MMF)
• Epratuzumab: anti-CD22 MAb
• Anti-T cell treatments undergoing trials:
• Abatacept (CTLA4 fusion protein)

Other important treatment features
• Chronic steroid therapy requires bone protection therapy
(bisphosphonate, calcium, and vitamin D).
• Oral contraceptives are not contraindicated, but low-oestrogen or
progesterone-only pills should be used.
• Splenectomy may be required for thrombocytopenia where this is
antibody mediated and resistant to immunosuppressive therapy. Great
care needs to be taken with these patients in view of the increased
infective risk.
• Patients on any form of immunosuppressive therapy need to have their
humoral and cellular immune status monitored (see Box 12.3), and
preventive measures, such as low-dose co-trimoxazole and antifungals,
may be required.
• Anti-phospholipid syndrome requires anticoagulation (see p.296).

Paediatric SLE
• The disease in children is very similar to that in adults.
• Difﬁculties arise because the marker antibodies are frequently not
present until the child has been ill for some time, making diagnosis
difﬁcult. There is also often overlap of symptoms with childhood CTDs.
• Before puberty, the male to female ratio is increased compared with
that in adults (1:5).
• The use of diagnostic tests should be applied just as in adult disease.
However, where there is a high suspicion of disease, but no antibodies,
tests should be repeated at regular intervals (every 2-3 months) as
antibodies may appear later.
2 Remember that signiﬁcant titres of autoantibodies will be lower in
children than in adults.
• Management follows the same lines as in adults, although greater care
needs to be taken over the use of steroids to avoid stunting growth.

CHAPTER 12

Connective tissue disease

Drug-related lupus (DRL)
A large number of drugs have been associated with drug-induced lupus.
• Key drugs are:
• hydralazine
• procainamide
• methyldopa
• quinidine
• chlorpromazine
• minocyline (particularly associated with autoimmune hepatitis)
• isoniazid
• penicillamine
• phenytoin
• anti-TNF agents (inﬂiximab, etanercept etc.)
• ACE-inhibitors.
• Chemical features of drugs associated with DRL include the
presence of:
• arylamine or hydrazine groups
• sulphydryl groups.
• Patient factors include:
• acetylator status
• polymorphisms of P450 cytochrome enzymes.
• Speciﬁcity of anti-nuclear antibody is usually but not exclusively antihistone (>95%):
• antibodies recognize complex of histone dimer H2A-H2B + dsDNA
• with hydralazine DRL the speciﬁcity is H1 and H3/H4 complex
• anti-dsDNA antibodies are usually absent
• The presence of ANCA has also been associated with hydralazineinduced lupus (with glomerulonephritis)
• It is important to take a clear drug history when patients are identiﬁed
with ANCA in order to exclude the possibility of drug-induced lupus.
• Symptoms tend to be mild.
2 Drug-induced antinuclear antibodies may occur without symptoms.
• Disease often remits once the offending drugs are withdrawn.
• Patients with persistent symptoms should be treated in the normal
way.

SJÖGREN’S SYNDROME

Sjögren’s syndrome
Sjögren’s syndrome may occur as either a primary disorder in its own right
or accompanying other connective tissue diseases. There is a strong association with other autoimmune diseases, particularly thyroid disease and
primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC). The primary pathology is a lymphocytic
inﬁltrate into the exocrine glands, affecting salivary and lacrimal glands, and
also glands of the genital and respiratory tracts.
HCV infection may give rise to similar symptoms and must be excluded
at the outset.

Aetiology and immunopathology
• The cause is unknown, although there is some evidence to suggest that
viral infections, including EBV, HCV, and retroviruses, may contribute
substantially.
• There is an immunogenetic background, shared with other
autoimmune diseases, including B8 and DR3. There is a strong
association, independent of ethnic background, with DQA1*0501.
• B-cell activating factor (BAFF) is elevated, especially in patients with
hypergammaglobulinaemia. Possibly produced by glandular epithelial
cell in response to type I interferons.
• CD40+ B cells more resistant to apoptosis.
• Proto-oncogenes are also expressed, and the disease is frequently
accompanied by monoclonal expansion of B cells within the glands,
accompanied by IgMκ paraprotein production and the development of
type II cryoglobulins.
• Disease may terminate in frank lymphoma, usually extra-nodal lowgrade B-cell lymphomas.
• Antibodies to A-fodrin may be associated with the disease.

Clinical features
• Dry gritty eyes, dry mouth, difﬁculty swallowing, recurrent parotitis
and gingivitis, recurrent chest infections (bronchiectasis), dyspareunia,
and main sicca symptoms.
• There may be subclinical pancreatitis.
• Fatigue and malaise are marked and early features.
• Increased IL1RA is found in CSF, suggesting that IL-1 may mediate
fatigue.
• Arthralgia, arthritis, and ﬁbromyalgic pain are common.
• Interstitial lung disease may be found on CT scanning.
• A Fanconi syndrome may occur.
• Both CNS and peripheral nerve involvement have been reported.
• Hemiparesis, transverse myelopathy, seizures, movement disorders,
and aseptic meningitis. MS may occur.
• Features of other autoimmune diseases will be present.
• Raynaud’s may be present if there are cryoglobulins.
• Salivary glands may be enlarged. Lymphadenopathy should always be
taken seriously if it does not settle once local infection has been dealt
with (risk of lymphoma). Consider CT of salivary glands ± biopsy.
• Biopsy of minor salivary glands may be diagnostically useful.

279

280

CHAPTER 12

Connective tissue disease

• Secondary Sjögren’s appears to be more limited (sicca symptoms).
• Clinical diagnosis may be made by Schirmer’s test (normal >15mm
wetting in 5min; <5mm is abnormal); Rose Bengal staining of the
cornea may demonstrate corneal damage.

Immunological testing (see Box 12.4)
• Diagnostic testing should include ANA, dsDNA, ENA, RhF, thyroid
and mitochondrial antibodies, C3/C4, serum immunoglobulins and
electrophoresis, cryoglobulins, B2-microglobulin, CRP/ESR, and IgG
subclasses.
• Typically associated with anti-Ro antibodies (both Ro52 and Ro60) and
anti-La antibodies.
• If ANA is negative and primary Sjögren’s syndrome is suspected,
salivary gland antibodies may be helpful.
• HEp-2 screening may also pick up other speciﬁcities known to be
associated, such as antibodies to the Golgi body and the nuclear
mitotic apparatus.
• RhF will be found in 90% of patients developing arthritis, 70% will be
positive for anti-Ro, and 40% for anti-La. ANA will usually show a ﬁne
speckled appearance. DsDNA will be negative.
• Thyroid antibodies are common (30%) and mitochondrial antibodies
will be found in those going on to develop PBC.
• Complements will usually be normal or elevated (this is not a
complement-consuming disorder). Low levels should raise questions
about the primary underlying diagnosis.
• There is invariably a marked restricted-clonality
hypergammaglobulinaemia, often with IgMκ paraproteins on
immunoﬁxation.
• Increase in IgG is restricted to IgG1, with reductions seen in IgG2,
IgG3, and IgG4, hence the electrophoretic appearances. Therefore
measurement of IgG subclasses is a helpful adjunctive test, as no other
conditions except myeloma give this pattern.
• Cryoglobulins should always be sought, particularly if there is any
cutaneous involvement.
• B2-microglobulin should be monitored as a marker of
lymphoproliferation.
• ESR and CRP are high, with an anaemia of chronic disease.
• Raised alkaline phosphatase of liver origin may indicate PBC.
• Thyroid function must be checked at baseline and regularly thereafter.
• Long-term monitoring of patients should be undertaken at the
clinical level. Regular checks for paraproteins and evidence of
lymphoproliferation are essential.
• Clinical checks should include thyroid and liver, in view of the strong
association with Sjögren’s syndrome.
• There is no value in monitoring the autoantibodies, unless there is a
clinical change.

SJÖGREN’S SYNDROME

Treatment
• Symptomatic treatment with lubricants forms the mainstay of
treatment.
• Spectacles help reduce the drying effect of the air.
• Meticulous attention to oral hygiene reduces the oral infective
problems.
• Pilocarpine has also been used to increase saliva ﬂow.
• Hydroxychloroquine is valuable for the arthralgia and fatigue.
• Topical ocular ciclosporin has been approved by the FDA.
• The role of steroids and cytotoxics is less clear, and it has been
suggested that these may increase the rate of progression to
lymphoma. However, they are necessary if there is extraglandular
involvement and/or vasculitis.
• Methotrexate (weekly orally or subcutaneously) may be used.
• Anti-TNF drugs do not appear to be helpful.
• Other biological agents (rituximab, epratuzumab) are undergoing trials.
• Long-term follow-up needs to be instituted for early identiﬁcation of
malignancy.
• Refer all suspicious persistent swellings for CT/MRI and biopsy.

CHAPTER 12

Connective tissue disease

IgG4-related chronic sclerosing
dacryoadenitis
• Rare disease mimicking Sjögren’s syndrome. Other complications of
IgG4 disease may include:
• autoimmune pancreatitis
• sclerosing cholangitis
• non-infectious aortitis.
• Inﬂammatory sclerosing masses with plasma cell inﬁltrates in
submandibular and lacrimal glands.
• IgG4 signiﬁcantly raised without changes in other IgG subclasses
(unique abnormality that is diagnostic).
• Responds to corticosteroids.

Undifferentiated connective tissue
disease
• This usually comprises a clinical syndrome that does not satisfy the
criteria for any single connective tissue disease, either clinically or
serologically.
• Typical features include:
• Raynaud’s syndrome
• polyarthritis
• rash
• interstitial lung disease
• myalgia.
• Such patients need to be treated symptomatically while being followed
clinically and serologically (testing as for lupus, see ‘SLE: immunological
testing’, p.272).
• Capillaroscopy may identify abnormalities.
• Some patients with chronic fatigue may have positive ANA and/or
low C4. These need to be followed to exclude the possibility of a
prodromal CTD.
• Interval measurement of ENA antibodies is helpful (every 6-12
months).
• Some will resolve spontaneously and others will progress to a more
clearly deﬁned disease.
• Early intervention with DMARDs may alter the natural history.

MIXED CONNECTIVE TISSUE DISEASE (MCTD)

Mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD)
Whether MCTD is truly a distinct entity has been questioned by some
experts on the basis that it may evolve into SLE or another typical connective tissue disease, or that these diseases may evolve into MCTD. Even if
it forms part of the spectrum of SLE, it is distinct enough to be considered
separately.

Aetiology and pathogenesis
• It is associated with DR4 and DQ3.

Clinical features
• Arthralgia (96%), swollen hands (88%), Raynaud’s (84%), abnormal
oesophageal motility (77%), myositis (72%), lymphadenopathy (68%).
• Serositis, leucopenia, thrombocytopenia, sclerodactyly, pulmonary
ﬁbrosis (with reduced gas transfer, 70%), pulmonary hypertension
(major cause of death), and aseptic meningitis may also occur.
• Trigeminal neuropathy may occur in 10%.
• Fatigue and malaise are common in the prodrome.
• Up to 50% of patients develop nephritis.

Diagnosis (see Box 12.5)
•
•
•
•

•
•
•
•
•
•

There is polyclonal hypergammaglobulinaemia.
Cryoglobulins may be detected.
C3/C4 may be reduced.
Autoantibodies show a coarse speckled ANA, absent or low level of
anti-dsDNA antibodies, and strongly positive anti-U1 RNP (90-100% of
true MCTD patients).
• antibodies to U1 RNP 68kD and A protein are associated with
increased severity of symptoms
Presence of high levels of anti-dsDNA suggests SLE not MCTD.
RhF is positive in 40-60%.
Anti-phospholipid antibodies may be associated with pulmonary
hypertension.
ESR/CRP are elevated and there is an anaemia of chronic disease.
Thrombocytopenia may be due to anti-platelet antibodies or the
presence of anti-phospholipid antibodies.
CK may be elevated from muscle involvement but also in aseptic
meningitis and trigeminal neuropathy.

Treatment
• Treatment is with NSAIDs and/or hydroxychloroquine for fatigue,
myalgia, and polyarthritis.
• Steroids plus cytotoxic agents (azathioprine, cyclophosphamide) are
used for severe organ involvement. Methotrexate is used where there
is evidence of erosive joint disease.
• Anticoagulation is used for the anti-phospholipid antibodies (see
p.294).
• Raynaud’s phenomenon (see p.296).
• Other organ-based symptoms are managed appropriately.

Polymyositis (PM), inclusion
body myositis (IBM), and
dermatomyositis (DM)
Polymyositis and dermatomyositis may be idiopathic (no known accompanying disease) or they may be associated with malignancy. Juvenile forms
also exist. Rare forms of myositis include inclusion-body myositis, eosinophilic myositis, granulomatous myositis, and orbital myositis (orbital
pseudo-tumour).

Aetiology and immunopathology
• These diseases tend to be more common in patients of African origin
than in Caucasians (4:1) and also in females (2:1).
• PM and IVBM are associated with HLA DR3 (DRB1*0301 and
DQB1*0201) and DRw52 (75% of cases.
• Juvenile DM is associated with DQA1*0501.

POLYMYOSITIS (PM) AND DERMATOMYOSITIS (DM)

• Older patients tend to be more affected, but the diseases can occur at
any age.
• In adult patients there is a strong association with underlying
malignancy:
• carcinoma
• more rarely, lymphoma
• muscle disease often appears at a time when the tumour is still
occult and it is debated how intensively one should investigate to
identify the tumour
• muscle disease will often remit when the tumour is treated.
• Seasonal variations have been noted in onset.
• Anti-Jo-1 disease occurs mainly in the spring.
• Anti-SRP myositis occurs mainly in the autumn.
• Indicates possible association with separate infectious agents, as yet
unidentiﬁed.
• Muscle inﬁltrate with both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells.
• Restriction VB gene usage suggests that the recruitment is speciﬁc
to muscle antigens.
• Muscle ﬁbres express MHC class II antigens and there is an increase
in local expression of adhesion molecules (ICAM-1).
• B cells seem to play little role, and the pathogenicity of the
autoantibodies known to occur is uncertain.
• Complement is involved in the muscle ﬁbre destruction.
• Role of high-dose IVIg in PM/DM is to interfere with complement
activation.
• A very wide range of autoantibodies have been identiﬁed, although
many are not routinely available through diagnostic laboratories. The
PM/DM-associated antibodies comprise one of the most complex sets
of any autoimmune disease (see Table 12.3).
• Most important subgroup of PM/DM is associated with transferRNA synthetases, which accounts for about 30% of cases.
• Most important antibody is anti-Jo-1. This antibody, together with the
rarer antibodies (Table 12.3), identiﬁes the anti-synthetase syndrome.
• Characterized by aggressive myositis, prone to relapse,
accompanied by:
• a high incidence of interstitial lung disease, mechanic’s hands,
Raynaud’s syndrome, inﬂammatory polyarthritis, sclerodactyly, and
sicca syndrome.
• Response of this subgroup to treatment is much poorer, but it is
less likely to be associated with malignancy.
• Anti-Jo-1 antibodies frequently rise before the onset of overt
muscle damage, indicating a possible pathogenic role, especially as it
is now known that autoantibodies may enter selected viable cells.
• Other antibodies, recognizing other nuclear antigens, have been
identiﬁed.
• Anti-signal recognition particle (SRP) in adult PM (lung disease
uncommon); disease is associated with severe and aggressive
myopathy.
• Anti-Mi-2 in dermatomyositis (recognizes helicase).

285

CHAPTER 12

Connective tissue disease

• Anti-KS in PM with Raynaud’s and lung disease.
• Anti-Zo in PM and lung disease. anti-Annexin XI in juvenile
dermatomyositis (60%).
• anti-hPMS-1 (DNA mismatch repair enzyme) in 7.5% of cases of
myositis.
• Polymyositis may occur as part of overlap syndromes, such as:
• MCTD (anti-U1 RNP)
• polymyositis-scleroderma overlap (anti-PM-Scl)
• SLE-myositis overlap (anti-Ku).

• Amyopathic DM may be associated with antibodies to CDM-140.

Clinical features
• Major clinical feature is proximal muscle weakness with pain. Onset
may be acute with fever. Distal muscle involvement is rare, and should
raise other diagnostic possibilities—infection (viral, bacterial, parasitic),
inclusion-body myositis, and metabolic problems.
• Gottren’s papules are often seen on the knuckles, and the typical
heliotrope rash around the eyes and a generalized erythematous rash
(may be photosensitive) mark out DM.
• Signs of inﬂammatory arthritis and scleroderma; ‘mechanic’s hands’
(thickened, cracked skin) identify the anti-synthetase syndrome.
• Dyspnoea from lung involvement (interstitial lung disease). If there is
accompanying pain, pulmonary embolus may be suspected.
• Although the heart is rarely involved, presentations with atypical chest
pain used to be diagnostically difﬁcult due to raised CK. This is less
of a problem since the introduction of cardiac-speciﬁc troponins as
diagnostic test for myocardial damage.
• Diaphragmatic involvement typically leads to dyspnoea when lying ﬂat.
• Gastrointestinal disease may occur (slowed transit, reﬂux).
• Renal disease is rare, but high serum myoglobin levels may trigger
renal impairment if there is very active myositis.

PM/DM: DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT

PM/DM: diagnosis and treatment
Diagnosis (see Box 12.6)
• Muscle biopsy and electromyogram (EMG) should be considered. As
the disease may be patchy within a muscle, a normal biopsy does not
categorically exclude disease.
• Biopsy will exclude IBM
• MRI is excellent at identifying affected muscles non-invasively. Biopsy
may not be necessary in a typical presentation associated with typical
autoantibodies.
• Lung function tests, including gas transfer, mouth pressures, and CT of
lungs, are essential.
• Anti-Jo-1 recognizes primarily a cytoplasmic antigen. This will not be
recognized on rodent liver. If PM/DM are suspected, screening on
HEp-2 cells is most revealing as many of the cytoplasmic and nuclear
antigens associated with myositis can be identiﬁed from the patterns of
staining. Antibodies to Jo-1 should be speciﬁcally requested.
• Mi-2 antibodies are preferentially associated with DM rather than PM.
• Nucleolar ANA may also be seen, although these may also be found in
patients with scleroderma.
• Antibodies to Ku, SRP, Mi-2, PM-Scl, and other synthetases may be
available from certain specialist centres.

Treatment
• Management is with high-dose steroids,
• Failure to control disease with acceptable levels of steroids is an
indication for second-line therapy:
• weekly methotrexate (where there is no lung disease)
• azathioprine
• mycophenolate mofetil
• cyclophosphamide
• possibly ciclosporin or tacrolimus—tacrolimus may work where
ciclosporin has failed.
• Both steroids and cyclophosphamide can be given as intravenous pulse
therapy, particularly if there is progressive lung disease.
• Intolerance of, contraindications to, or failure of ﬁrst- and second-line
agents should lead to consideration of the use of high-dose IVIg.
• Patients with malignancy-associated PM/DM respond poorly to
immunosuppressive therapy, as do those with the anti-synthetase
syndrome and IBM.
• Rituximab has been used in resistant disease.
• Hydroxychloroquine may help in resistant skin disease.
• Inﬂiximab and etanercept have both been used in small series.

Overlap syndromes
Patients often exhibit features of more than one connective tissue disease.
Moreover, clinical features may change over a period of time, and this may
be accompanied by changes in the serological proﬁle. Therefore it is wise
not to be too dogmatic in pigeon-holing patients.
Recognized overlap syndromes include the following.
• Mixed connective tissue disease: see ‘Mixed connective tissue disease
(MCTD)’, p.283.
• Marker antibody proﬁle is anti-U1 RNP in the absence of antidsDNA.
• ‘Rhupus’: a form of lupus with more aggressive destructive arthritis
more typical of rheumatoid arthritis, but with other typical lupus
features.
• There are no speciﬁc serological markers, as many patients with
SLE have rheumatoid factors anyway without developing overt
features of RhA.
• Whether this is a true overlap syndrome is debatable.
• Polymyositis-scleroderma overlap: features of polymyositis and
scleroderma, although the myositis may be mild.
• Serologically deﬁned by detection of anti-PM-Scl.
• Calcinosis may be severe.
• Treatment of calcinosis is difﬁcult: calcium-channel blockers, lowdose warfarin, and anti-TNF agents may all be beneﬁcial.
• SLE-myositis overlap: features of SLE with prominent myositis.
• Serologically deﬁned by detection of anti-Ku.

SYSTEMIC SCLEROSIS (SSC): CREST AND LIMITED VARIANTS

Systemic sclerosis (SSc): CREST and
limited variants
There are many variants of scleroderma, including localized and systemic
forms. There is also considerable overlap with other connective tissue
diseases (SLE, MCTD, PM/DM). The pathological process is very similar to
that of chronic graft-versus-host disease. The CREST syndrome (calcinosis, Raynaud’s, oesophageal dysmotility, sclerodactyly, and telangiectasia)
forms an entirely clinically and serologically distinct subgroup; this is now
referred to as limited scleroderma, but the acronym reminds one of the
expected features (see ‘Scleroderma mimics’, p.293). Localized scleroderma includes morphoea and linear scleroderma.

Aetiology and immunopathogenesis
• There is a female preponderance (M:F = 1:4).
• Childhood onset is rare.
• A wide range of MHC antigens have been associated with scleroderma
variants, including DR1, DR3, DRw52, DR5, although there is signiﬁcant
racial variation.
• Choctaw Indians in Oklahoma have a very high incidence of SSc
associated with abnormalities in the ﬁbrillin-1 gene FBN1.
• Autoantibodies have been detected against ﬁbrillin 1.
• A mouse model of SSc, tight-skin, is also associated with a
duplication of the FBN1 gene.
• Chromosomal abnormalities (ring chromosomes, chromatid breaks,
etc.) are common in SSc—signiﬁcance is uncertain.
• Parvovirus B19 has been associated with SSc development.
• Strong association of scleroderma-like conditions with environmental
factors:
• dust exposure
• organic solvents such as vinyl chloride, resins, ‘toxic oil’
contaminated with aniline
• drugs such as cocaine, pentazocine, bleomycin, fenﬂuramine
• contribution of silicone breast implants to scleroderma is uncertain.
• Precise immunological involvement is unclear, but targets include
endothelial cells and ﬁbroblasts, with cytokine production leading to
increased collagen synthesis.
• Obvious vascular changes, such as vasomotor instability (Raynaud’s),
but also direct damage to blood vessels, such as can be seen in nailfold
capillaries.
• Unlike other connective tissue diseases, there is very little in the way
of a systemic inﬂammatory response and CRP/ESR may be low or
normal.

CHAPTER 12

Connective tissue disease

• A variety of autoantibodies have been identiﬁed (see Box 12.7),
although the signiﬁcance of some of them has not been fully elucidated
(see Part 2).
• Anti-nucleolar antibodies are common (see Box 12.7).
• Anti-endothelial cell antibodies (AECA) have been reported and
may lead to apoptosis of endothelial cells, triggering a cascade of
tissue damage.
• Anti-centromere antibodies and anti-Scl-70 antibodies are mutually
exclusive. Only two cases of the presence of both antibodies
together have ever been reported.
• Antibodies to RNA Pol III are found in patients with diffuse
cutaneous scleroderma and are a marker for increased risk of renal
crisis.
• Antibodies to U3-RNP (ﬁbrillarin) are associated with increased
risk of pulmonary hypertension and skeletal muscle involvement.
• Antibodies to B2-glycoprotein I (seen in APS) are also associated
with macrovascular disease and are a risk factor for digitial
ischaemia and pulmonary hypertension.
• Antibodies to Th/To are markers for pulmonary hypertension.
• Increased TGF-B and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) may play
a role in the ﬁbrosis.
• Scleroderma-like disease is seen in chronic GvHD. In SSc,
microchimerism due to persistence of fetal cells in the mother or

maternal cells in the child is common and may be the triggering event
(i.e. SSc is a naturally occurring chronic GvHD).

Clinical features
• Localized forms include linear morphoea (‘coup de sabre’) and limited
scleroderma where the changes are limited to the extremities without
systemic manifestations.
• Raynaud’s phenomenon is severe.
• CREST syndrome has a more generalized involvement, and may give rise
to late pulmonary hypertension, but less often to renal involvement.

SSC: DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT

• Systemic sclerosis, on the other hand, leads to major renal and lung
involvement. Involvement of the kidney may lead to rapid onset
of severe hypertension and renal failure due to obliteration of the
glomeruli (scleroderma kidney).
• Lung disease includes interstitial ﬁbrosis, an increased risk of
carcinoma, bronchiectasis, and pulmonary hypertension.
• Gastrointestinal involvement leads to severe oesophageal reﬂux,
malabsorption due to poor small bowel motility, and bacterial
overgrowth. Secondary problems may arise from a deﬁciency of key
vitamins and minerals. Poor colonic motility may lead to pseudoobstruction.
• There is an association with thyroid disease, primary biliary cirrhosis,
and rare neurological involvement (neuropathy).
• The vascular disturbance may lead to ischaemia of the ends of digits
which, if not treated rapidly, will lead to dry gangrene and progressive
reabsorption of the terminal phalanges.
• Systemic forms are often accompanied by a prodrome of malaise and
fatigue.
• Rarely, there may be renal and lung involvement without cutaneous
involvement.

SSc: diagnosis and treatment
Diagnosis (see Box 12.8)
• Screening for anti-nuclear antibodies may reveal the presence of
nucleolar staining patterns, or speckled patterns due to the presence
of anti-centromere antibodies (speciﬁc for CREST). HEp-2 cells give
the best differentiation of the staining patterns and these should be
followed up by speciﬁc tests for Scl-70 (speciﬁc for SSc).
• Assays for individual nucleolar antigens are not routinely available,
apart from RNA Pol III.
• In the CREST syndrome there may also be antibodies to the M2
antigen (25%). 30% will be positive for rheumatoid factor.
• ESR/CRP will be low.
• All patients should be screened for thyroid disease.
• All patients with Raynaud’s should also be checked for cryoglobulins.
• Thermography is useful to conﬁrm abnormal responses to cold
challenge.
• Nailfold capillaroscopy is valuable for diagnosis and objective
monitoring of progression.
• Baseline lung function, including gas transfer, CXR ± CT scanning
should be carried out for all systemic forms.
• Echocardiography should be carried out to monitor for the
development of pulmonary hypertension.

• Renal function needs to be assessed at presentation and then
monitored regularly.
• No immunological tests are valuable for monitoring.

Treatment
• Many drugs have been tried in scleroderma but few have stood the
test of proper double-blind placebo-controlled trials.
• NSAIDs and steroids should be avoided if possible as they may worsen
or trigger the development of renal crises.
• Penicillamine and colchicine have been used, with some evidence that
they slow progression.
• Steroids only help with active inﬂammatory problems such as myositis
or arthritis (but watch for renal deterioration) and use for short
periods only.
• Cytotoxics such as azathioprine and cyclophosphamide may have some
beneﬁt; low dose methotrexate may be better.
• Anti-TNF agents may be helpful in selected patients.
• Ciclosporin may be of beneﬁt (but watch renal function!).
• High-dose immunosuppression with autologous stem cell support has
been tried. However, survival was poor!
• Anti-TNFs, rituximab and anti-TGFs have been tried without much
evidence of beneﬁt.
• Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (imatinib and analogues) may show some
promise.
• Raynaud’s may be difﬁcult to control. Avoidance of cold and wearing
warm clothing and heated gloves may help. Low-dose aspirin may
improve circulation. Other treatments to be tried include:
• high-dose ﬁsh oil or evening primrose oil

SCLERODERMA MIMICS

•
•
•
•
•
•

• slow-release or long-acting calcium-channel blockers (nicardipine,
felodipine, amlodipine, nimodipine)
• ACE inhibitors; angiotensin-2 receptor blockers
• topical GTN (glyceryl trinitrate) ointment
• pentoxifylline
• 5-HT antagonist (ketanserin, not a licensed drug)
• SSRIs such as ﬂuoxetine
• Phosphodiesterase inhibitors (sildenaﬁl and analogues) are valuable
for severe cases.
Acute ischaemia should be treated with prostacyclin analogue infusions
(epoprostenol, iloprost); although the half-life is only seconds, the
clinical effect may last for months (reasons unknown).
Infection in sclerodermatous skin needs aggressive treatment, often
with intravenous antibiotics.
Malabsorption should be sought and treated:
• continuous oxytetracycline may reduce bacterial overgrowth.
Omeprazole, low-dose erythromycin, or octreotide may help with
reﬂux and improve motility.
Pulmonary artery hypertension can be treated with phosphodiesterase
inhibitors (sildenaﬁl and analogues) and endothelin-1 receptor
antagonists (bosentan)
Avoid calcium-channel blockers where there is oesophageal
involvement as they make the reﬂux worse.

Scleroderma mimics
A number of conditions mimic scleroderma.

Nephrogenic systemic ﬁbrosis (nephrogenic ﬁbrosing
dermatopathy)
• Occurs in patients with renal failure.
• Similar to eosinophilic fasciitis.
• May be triggered by gadolinium or erythropoeitin.

Scleromyxoedema (papular mucinosis)
• Occurs is patients with malignancy, or alone.
• Waxy skin thickening.
• Paraprotein often present.

Scleroedema
• Occurs in patients with diabetes.
• May be associated with presence of a paraprotein.

Eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome
• Pathology is similar to eosinophilic fasciitis (p.294).
• Has been associated with consumption of L -tryptophan as a food
supplement.

Toxic oil syndrome
• Caused by aniline-contaminated cooking oil.
• Prominent eosinophilia.

Biopsy essential for conﬁrmation of diagnosis.

Management
• Corticosteroids are ﬁrst-line treatment.
• Hydroxychloroquine may be an alternative.
• PUVA, ciclosporin, and hdIVIg have been used in resistant cases.

Anti-phospholipid syndrome (APS)
This set of syndromes (now sometimes referred to as Hughes’ syndrome)
is associated with antibodies against a range of biologically relevant
phospholipids.

Aetiology and immunopathology
• Both sexes may be affected, although it appears to be more common
in females.

ANTI-PHOSPHOLIPID SYNDROME (APS)

• A third of patients with SLE may have APL antibodies.
• MHC association has been reported (DR4, DR7, among others). Why
the antibodies arise is not known, although non-pathogenic antibodies
may be induced by infection.
• Appearance of APL antibodies can be triggered by viral infection
(EBV, HIV, hepatitis viruses), bacterial infections, malaria, leishmaniasis,
syphilis, and Pneumocystis.
• APL antibodies may also be seen in association with malignancy
(lymphoma, solid tumours), Klinefelter’s syndrome, and other
autoimmune diseases (pernicious anaemia, diabetes, inﬂammatory
bowel disease, ITP).
• Antibodies appear to recognize a variety of different phospholipids,
but pathogenic antibodies seem to require the presence of a cofactor,
B2-glycoprotein-I (apolipoprotein H). Anti-phospholipid antibodies
that arise secondary to infection (such as syphilis, EBV infection) do
not require the presence of B2-glycoprotein-I, and do not seem to
cause a clotting disorder.
• Spectrum of antibodies includes both anti-cardiolipin antibodies and
lupus anticoagulants. Either may be found in the absence of the other,
but the clinical signiﬁcance is identical.
• Activity of the antibodies in vivo is complex, but includes activation
of platelets, interference with endothelial cell function (reduced
prostacyclin production, reduced thrombomodulin function),
complement activation, and reduced levels of proteins C and S, leading
to a procoagulant effect.
• A ‘second hit’ may be required to trigger thrombosis (oral
contraceptive pill (OCP), pregnancy, malignancy, etc.)
• Other APL antibodies which may be found include:
• anti-prothrombin
• anti-annexin V
• antibodies to phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylinositol,
phsophatidylethanolamine.

Clinical features
• Anti-phospholipid antibodies can occur either as an isolated ﬁnding or
in association with other connective tissue disease, usually SLE.
• Major clinical features are arterial and venous thromboses, with
pulmonary emboli, recurrent miscarriage, and thrombocytopenia. As
the arterial system can be affected, strokes in young people should
always be investigated. Recurrent minor cerebrovascular occlusions
may lead to a multi-infarct dementia.
• Recurrent fetal loss is common.
• APS is associated with ITP and haemolytic anaemia.
• Other clinical syndromes associated include the Budd-Chiari
syndrome, chorea, transverse myelitis, pulmonary hypertension
(recurrent asymptomatic PEs), and cardiac valve lesions.
• Livedo reticularis is a useful cutaneous marker, and may be associated with
Sneddon’s syndrome (hypertension, cerebrovascular disease, and livedo).
• Catastrophic APS (CAPS): multi-organ failure due to DIC-like picture,
associated with adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

295

296

CHAPTER 12

Connective tissue disease

APS: diagnosis and treatment
Diagnosis (see Box 12.9)
• Clinical suspicion should lead to testing for IgG and IgM anti-cardiolipin
antibodies (ACAs) and clotting studies for lupus anticoagulants (LAC),
which should include APTT (prolonged) and a dilute Russell’s viper
venom test (dRVVT) (prolonged).
• 85% of patients will have both ACA and LAC, but either can be
present alone
• FBC should be checked for thrombocytopenia.
• The signiﬁcance of IgM ACAs alone is uncertain but, if associated with
clinical features of recurrent thrombosis, this should be treated seriously.
• IgA ACAs have been described. They may be associated with thrombosis.
• IgG ACAs are most strongly associated with thrombosis
• A false-positive VDRL test may be noted, but this is not diagnostically
helpful.
• Assays for B2-glycoprotein-I are available and may help to distinguish
between antibodies of no signiﬁcance triggered by infection and those
of pathogenic signiﬁcance. At present it is not clear that they are
necessary for routine management.
• There is no correlation between the numerical value of ACAs detected
by ELISA and the severity of symptoms, although there has been a
suggestion that levels may correlate with neurological disease in SLE.
• To determine whether there is a primary or secondary APS, a full
search should be done for other markers of connective tissue diseases.

RAYNAUD’S PHENOMENON

• Assays for antibodies to individual phospholipids are available in
research centres for investigations of atypical cases.
• There is no indication that routine monitoring of levels of antiphospholipid antibodies is helpful.

Management
• Asymptomatic patients require no treatment, or just low-dose aspirin.
• Once thrombosis has occurred, there is no role for aspirin alone.
• Symptomatic patients should be warfarinized for life with INR 3-4.
If thrombotic events continue, low-dose aspirin should be added
(beware of haemorrhagic complications).
• Role of steroids ± cytotoxics is controversial, but may be tried where
there are continuing catastrophic thrombotic events. Do not expect
there to be much change in antibody levels.
• Hydroxychloroquine may be helpful (reverses platelet activation)
• Plasmapheresis may be tried, but beware of rebound rises in antibody.
• Catastrophic APS (50% mortality) is treated with pulse IV
methylprednisolone 1g/day × 3, with full heparinization. Plasmapheresis
and hdIVIg have also been used. Rituximab 375mg/m2 can be used as
an alternative. ITU support is required.
• For management in pregnancy, no treatment or low-dose aspirin is
recommended for those with either no history or a history only of
ﬁrst-trimester loss.
• Where there is a history of second/third-trimester loss the treatment
is low-dose aspirin ± subcutaneous heparin.
• If there is a previous history of thrombosis, low-dose aspirin and
heparin are suggested, even for ﬁrst pregnancies. Intravenous
immunoglobulin may also be valuable.Thrombocytopenia is rarely
severe but, if it is, hdIVIg and steroids may help. Splenectomy may
increase the thrombotic tendency if the platelet count rebound is very
high, and so needs to be considered carefully. Danazol may also be of
beneﬁt.

Raynaud’s phenomenon
Raynaud’s phenomenon refers to an exaggerated vascular response to
cold (and sometimes emotion). Common in women without evidence of
underlying disease (primary) but may be associated with connective tissues
diseases (SLE, RhA, dermatomyositis, scleroderma, limited scleroderma),
arterial occlusive diseases (cervical ribs), pulmonary hypertension, neurological diseases, paraproteinaemias (including cryoglobulinaemia, HCV
infection, Waldenström’s macroglobulinaemia), trauma, electrical shocks,
drugs (ergot derivatives, B-blockers, bleomycin, vinblastine, and cisplatin).
Primary Raynaud’s tends to be less severe.

Clinical features
• Cold-induced colour change (bluelwhitelred on rewarming).
• May affect ears and nose if severe.
• May be associated with migraine.

297

298

CHAPTER 12

Connective tissue disease

• Severe cases may lead to ischaemic ulceration and gangrene if left
untreated.
• Cutaneous ulceration may occur.
• Distinguish from acrocyanosis and erythromelalgia.
• acrocyanosis affects predominantly young women and causes
persistent cyanotic discoloration. It does not cause long-term
damage and treatment is not required
• Erythomelalgia affects predominantly men and causes burning
red disoloration of the feet and hands. It may be primary or
associated with polycythaemia rubra vera, essential thrombocytosis,
connective tissue diseases and drug therapy (bromocriptine and
analogues). It may respond to aspirin.

Diagnosis (see Box 12.10)
• Exclude secondary causes, e.g. autoimmune disease and
paraproteinaemia.
• Check for cryoglobulins and evidence of HCV infection.

Thermography

• Thermography with cold challenge is useful.
• Capillaroscopy will identify early vascular features of scleroderma.
• Check for cervical ribs and consider MR angiography.

Treatment
• See ‘Systemic sclerosis…’ p.289.
• Avoid cold exposure, particularly rapid temperature change.
• Thermal gloves and socks (battery-operated gloves are useful but
usually patients complain that they are too bulky).
• No smoking!!
• Low dose aspirin and omega-3 ﬁsh oils may be helpful for mild cases.

RHEUMATIC FEVER

• Topical GTN ointment is very helpful pre-exposure.
• Calcium-channel blockers (nifedipine, nicardipine, nimodipine,
amlodipine, diltiazem) are the ﬁrst line. Preferable to use slow-release
formulations or long-acting drugs.
• ACE inhibitors and angiotensin 2 inhibitors can be used.
• 0Most patients with Raynaud’s have low blood pressure and
tolerate anti-hypertensives poorly.
• High-dose vitamin E is a useful alternative.
• Alprostadil (PGE1) and epoprostenol (PGI2) infusions can give
prolonged relief. Essential if there is critical digital ischaemia.
• Heparin (unfractionated or low molecular weight) may also be
helpful in severe cases (probably because of its rheological and antiinﬂammatory properties).
• Sildenaﬁl and analogues are effective.
• Surgery may be required for compressive lesions or to perform
sympathectomy. Amputation of ischaemic digits may be required.

Livedo reticularis
A mottled net-like disoloration of the skin, which is worse on cold exposure. The primary benign form is more common in women. Secondary
forms may be associated with connective tissue diseases and ulceration. It
is particularly seen with the anti-phospholipid syndrome and with SLE and
Sneddon’s syndrome (see ‘Anti-phospholipid syndrome’, p.294). It may be
seen in cryoglobulinaemia and hyperviscosity syndromes. Treatment is for
the underlying disease.

Rheumatic fever
After a period of decline, rheumatic fever is now on the increase again,
paralleling the rise in infection with group A streptococci.

Aetiology and immunopathogenesis
• Disease is due to molecular mimicry between streptococcal M
proteins and N-acetyl-β-D -glucosamine found in particular strains of
group A streptococci (GAS) and myocardial proteins (cross-reactive
autoimmune response).
• Pharyngitis is an essential precursor.
• Expression of CD44 in the pharynx may be important—binds GAS.
• There is weak association in some racial groups with MHC Class II
antigens.

Clinical features
• Major criteria: carditis, migratory polyarthritis, chorea, subcutaneous
nodules, erythema marginatum.
• Minor criteria: pyrexia, arthralgia, elevated acute-phase proteins,
prolonged PR interval.

299

300

CHAPTER 12

Connective tissue disease

• Evidence of recent GAS infection (increased ASOT, anti-DNAse B,
positive culture, or antigen detection).

Diagnosis
• No speciﬁc immunological tests.
• Diagnosis is clinical, supported by serology/bacteriology.

Treatment
• Treat acutely with high-dose aspirin, together with anti-streptococcal
antibiotics.
• Steroids may be used in carditis (prednisolone 2mg/kg for 1-2 weeks,
then tapering off).
• Long-term prophylactic penicillin V 500mg bd for at least 10 years.
• Streptococcal vaccines may be useful but are difﬁcult to develop
because of the cross-reactivity.

Fibromyalgia
Condition characterized by widespread muscular and joint pain. Typical
point tenderness. Strongly associated with chronic fatigue syndrome (see
‘CFS 2: cause and immunopathogenesis, assessment, and investigations’,
Chapter 14, p.350). No speciﬁc diagnostic tests. Current research points
to ‘miswiring’ of pain perception centrally. Defects associated with serotonin transport, metabolisms, and receptors, as well as polymorphisms in
b-adrenrenoreceptor and dopamine receptor, have been implicated.

CHAPTER 13

Vasculitis

Causes of vasculitis
The term ‘vasculitis’ implies inﬂammation affecting predominantly the
blood vessels. The effects of the process depend on the location of the
inﬂammatory change and the size and type of the vessel involved. It is
unclear why there is selectivity for vessels of a certain type, size, or location. Although at present vasculitis is divided into primary and secondary,
it is likely that, with the passage of time, we shall identify environmental
triggers for most of the so-called ‘primary vasculitides’.

Primary vasculitis
Many classiﬁcations have been proposed for primary vasculitis, but the
most satisfactory is that based on the size of the vessel involved and on
the presence or absence of granulomata (Table 13.1). However, there is
considerable overlap in the size of vessels involved.

Secondary vasculitis
There are many causes of secondary vasculitis and the following is not an
exhaustive list.
• Infections: bacterial (streptococci, bacterial endocarditis), spirochetes
(syphilis, Borrelia), fungal (histoplasma), mycobacterial, rickettsial,
viral (EBV, HIV, VZV, CMV, hepatitis A, B, and C, inﬂuenza), with and
without cryoglobulins.
• Malignancy: hairy cell leukaemia, lymphoma, acute myeloid leukaemia,
with and without cryoﬁbrinogens.
• Drugs: biologicals (serum sickness), oral contraceptive, sulphonamides,
penicillins, thiazides, aspirin, illicit drugs (cocaine, amphetamines, LSD).
• Secondary to other autoimmune diseases: primary biliary cirrhosis,
Goodpasture’s syndrome, SLE, RhA, systemic sclerosis, Sjögren’s
syndrome, polymyositis/dermatomyositis, hypocomplementaemic
urticaria, relapsing polychondritis.
• Secondary to inﬂammatory bowel disease: ulcerative colitis, Crohn’s
disease; also intestinal bypass surgery.
• Complement component deﬁciency; A1-anti-trypsin deﬁciency.
• Mimics of vasculitis: cholesterol embolus, myxoma embolus, ergotism.

Diagnostic tests
Biopsy
• The most important diagnostic test is often biopsy of the affected
organ, which is particularly convenient if the skin is involved. Some
vasculitides may mimic neoplasia, e.g. Wegener’s and lymphomatoid
granulomatosis, and may therefore be difﬁcult to distinguish on imaging.
• Small biopsies are frequently non-diagnostic if vessels are not included.
• Temporal artery biopsy is essential in giant cell arteritis.

Imaging
• Imaging is an essential source of diagnostic information in cranial vasculitis
(MRI is better than CT), unless invasive biopsy is considered justiﬁed.
• Angiography is particularly helpful in identifying large- and mediumvessel disease. MR angiography is less invasive than conventional
angiography.
• Where there is suspected involvement of the coronary arteries, ECG,
echocardiography, and coronary angiography will be required.

Immunological tests
• Immunoglobulin measurements contribute very little to diagnosis,
being on the whole non-speciﬁcally elevated.

CHAPTER 13

Vasculitis

• Electrophoresis is necessary to identify paraproteins.
• Consider the possibility of cryoglobulinaemia and cryoﬁbrinogenaemia.
• Complement measurements (including complement breakdown
products or other tests of complement turnover) are essential,
particularly in secondary vasculitis.
• Autoantibody testing should include ANA, ENA, dsDNA, and ANCA
(including MPO and PR3).
• Role of anti-endothelial cell antibodies (AECA) is not determined as
these antibodies do not seem to be disease-speciﬁc.

Acute-phase response
• Acute-phase response is mostly high (except in the case of SLE,
although the ESR is high, and scleroderma).
• In some vasculitides, the caeruloplasmin is signiﬁcantly elevated. This
accounts for the greenish colour of serum from patients with active
vasculitis.
• Ferritin is high (>1000) in adult Still’s disease.
• Complement levels will be elevated: both C3 and C4 are acute-phase
proteins.
• Serum electrophoresis will show reduced albumin (negative acutephase protein) and elevated A2 band (A2-macroglobulin).
• Fibrinogen levels will also be elevated.
• Regular monitoring of the acute-phase response provides useful
information on the response of the disease to treatment.

Blood count
• Full blood count will often show the anaemia of chronic disease,
together with a thrombocytosis.
• There is often a lymphopenia.

Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP)
Aetiology and immunopathogenesis (see Box 13.1)
• HSP is a disease of the small blood vessels, characterized by palpable
purpura and triggered by infections, drugs, foods, insect bites, and
occasionally malignancy.
• IgA-containing immune complexes can be detected in affected tissues,
including glomeruli. These involve both IgA1 and IgA2, but contain
mostly polymeric IgA.
• IgA rheumatoid factors are also detectable and the levels are highest in
the acute phase of the disease; IgA ANCA may occur in some patients
(but not frequently enough to be diagnostically valuable).
• Polyclonal increase in IgA.
• Complement C3 and C4 are normal but C3d is increased, indicating
an increase in complement turnover. Properdin levels are decreased
while C1q levels are normal, suggesting alternate pathway activation.
Properdin and C3 deposits can be detected in affected kidneys. There
is an increased incidence of HSP in patients with C2 and C4 deﬁciency.

Clinical presentation
• Mainly disease of small children, with a peak age at onset of around
3 years, although it can occur at any age and does occur in adults, in
whom it is possibly more chronic.
• Male predominance.
• Often a history of a preceding upper respiratory tract infection.
• Typical clinical feature is palpable purpura especially at sites of
pressure (socks). These occur in crops, often with an urticarial
component, and may become conﬂuent. There is gastrointestinal
involvement, often with GI haemorrhage and associated with colic,
vomiting, and intussusception (3%).
• Renal disease with nephritis occurs in 50%, although in most cases this
recovers spontaneously and does not lead to long-term renal damage.
It may recur in transplanted kidneys in the small proportion who
have progressive renal damage (4-14%). Renal disease may be more
common in adult forms.
• Testicular involvement, pulmonary haemorrhage, pancreatitis, and
CNS involvement are all very rare complications.
• Myocardial involvement occurs in adults but rarely in children.
• Fever in 45-75% and often a migratory arthralgia.
• Attacks may recur every few weeks to months and are thought to be
triggered by b-haemolytic streptococci.

Diagnosis (see Box 13.2)
• Diagnosis is based on the signs and symptoms. If there is doubt, biopsy
will assist.
• In practice, only complement C3, C4 and total immunoglobulins will
be measured.
• Raised IgA in only 50%.
• Assays for IgA immune complexes and IgA rheumatoid factors are not
routinely available.

Treatment
• Treatment is not generally required as HSP is a self-limiting disease.
• Aspirin should be avoided as it will exacerbate the bowel bleeding.
• Steroids reduce symptoms but do not shorten the illness; they may
reduce the risk of developing nephritis.
• Factor XIII, which is required for healing of the bowel wall, has been
used experimentally by infusion to reduce GI haemorrhage.
• No conclusive evidence to support the use of plasmapheresis or
cytotoxics, although the latter would be used if there was major
glomerular involvement with signiﬁcant proteinuria.

IgA nephropathy (Berger’s disease)
• IgA nephropathy (Berger’s disease) is probably closely related to HSP,
and may be HSP with renal disease but no rash as the glomerular
lesion is identical (IgA deposition, with C3).
• Male preponderance.
• Often a history of a preceding upper respiratory tract infection.
• Unlike HSP, it may be familial but no speciﬁc genes identiﬁed.
• Bowel involvement and arthralgia may occur.
• Associated with IgA immune complexes and IgA RhF.
• Haemophilus parainﬂuenzae membrane antigens have been detected in
the kidney, and it is thought that this may be the candidate triggering
antigen.
• Persistent polyclonal elevation of IgA present.
• Relapses and remissions are common, but long-term prognosis is good.
• Can recur in transplanted kidney.

HYPERSENSITIVITY (‘ALLERGIC’) VASCULITIS

Buerger’s disease (thromboangiitis
obliterans)
• Affects predominantly small- and medium-sized arteries and veins.
• Occurs mainly in male smokers >30 years of age (<5% of patients are
non-smokers).
• Presents as a migratory thrombophlebitis with claudication in the
lower limbs, and less commonly in the upper limbs.
• Raynaud’s phenomenon is common.
• Ischaemic features will arise with peripheral gangrene.
• Systemic features are usually absent.
• No acute-phase response.
• Histology shows inﬁltration of blood vessels by neutrophils early, and
mononuclear cells later. Eventually ﬁbrosis of the vessel supervenes.
• Active inﬂammatory lesions improve when smoking ceases, suggesting
a direct toxic effect, although ﬁbrotic lesions will not improve.
• Diagnosis is on the history backed up by angiography.
• The most important therapeutic intervention is cessation of smoking.
• Aspirin, vasodilators, and anticoagulants are of no proven value,
although infusions of epoprostenol may help.
• Amputation may be required.

Hypersensitivity (‘allergic’) vasculitis
• This is a generic term, which is less used now, for small-vessel
cutaneous vasculitis.
• It is not a discrete disease and may be caused by:
• drugs, infections
• SLE/SS
• cryoglobulins
• inﬂammatory bowel disease
• HSP.
• Typical features are:
• purpura
• urticaria
• ulceration
• bullae
• systemic features (fever, arthralgia, myalgia).
• Drugs causing small vessel vasculitis include:
• hydralazine, propylthiouracil, allopurinol, thiazides, sulphonamides,
phenytoin, gold, penicillin
• some drugs (hydralazine, propylthiouracil) also trigger the
appearance of anti-MPO ANCA .

307

308

CHAPTER 13

Vasculitis

Microscopic polyarteritis (MPA)
Aetiology and immunopathogenesis
• MPA is an aggressive small-vessel vasculitis, which is distinct from
polyarteritis nodosa. It is thought that ANCA play a pathogenic role in
the development of the renal disease.
• May occur in families, suggesting either a transmissible agent or a
genetic background.

Clinical features
• Illness is often of relatively sudden onset with a short prodrome
of fever, malaise, and myalgia/arthralgia, followed by onset of
glomerulonephritis with hypertension and renal insufﬁciency.
• There may be pulmonary haemorrhage mimicking Goodpasture’s
syndrome. This has a high (75%) mortality.
• Extra-renal complications include:
• weight loss
• mononeuritis multiplex
• cutaneous vasculitis
• episcleritis
• rarely, coronary artery involvement
• lung and upper airway involvement does not occur.

Diagnosis (see Box 13.3)
• Renal biopsies show a necrotizing glomerulonephritis without evidence
of granulomata.
• Renal lesions are similar to those found in Wegener’s
granulomatosis.
• There is a paucity of immunoglobulin and complement in the biopsy
(pauci-immune GN).
• Granulomata are not found in biopsies.
• Angiography of the mesenteric vessels does not show
microaneurysms, thus distinguishing MPA from polyarteritis nodosa
(PAN).

PRIMARY ANGIITIS OF THE CNS (PACNS)

• P-ANCA, with anti-myeloperoxidase speciﬁcity on ELISA, can be
detected in the serum of 75% of patients; a few patients have C-ANCA
with proteinase 3 speciﬁcity; some patients may also have anti-GBM
antibodies.
• C3, C4 will be normal or high.
• ESR/CRP will be elevated.
• Normochromic normocytic anaemia is to be expected.
• Creatinine will be elevated.
• Microscopic haemturia is constant and there will be proteinuria
(>3g/24 hours).
• Other reported abnormalities include eosinophilia (14%).

Treatment
• Treatment is with high-dose (usually pulsed intravenous) steroids and
cyclophosphamide (pulse IV or continuous oral).
• There may be an acute role for plasmapheresis in preserving renal
function.
• Rituximab may be an effective alternative to cyclophosphamide
• Azathioprine or methotrexate may be used as maintenance therapy
once remission has been obtained.
• Pneumocystis prophylaxis is required.

Primary angiitis of the CNS (PACNS)
Aetiology and clinical features
• Primary cerebral vasculitis is very difﬁcult to diagnose ante-mortem
without recourse to biopsy, which has signiﬁcant hazards.
• Diagnosis of exclusion in patients with an acquired neurological deﬁcit.
• Infections such as HIV and VZV must be excluded.
• Similar features have been found following the use of cocaine,
amphetamines, and phenylpropanolamine, in ergotism, and with
phaeochromocytomas, suggesting a vasospastic origin.
• An association with viral (herpesviruses) and mycoplasma infections
has also been postulated; turkeys infected with Mycoplasma
gallisepticum develop a very similar illness.
• The disease is rare, and is primarily of small arteries of the cortex and
meninges.
• Presents in older patients with headache, disturbance of higher mental
function, and stroke. Males are more commonly affected.
• A more benign variant has also been described (benign angiitis of the
CNS (BACNS)), which is found more commonly in females.
• Systemic symptoms are absent (if they are present, it is likely that
there is a systemic vasculitis with cerebral involvement).

Diagnosis (see Box 13.4)
• Histology shows that most cases have a granulomatous inﬁltrate
around the blood vessels (granulomatous angiitis of the CNS
(GACNS)).

Brain biopsy

• CSF may be normal or show elevated protein and cell count.
• MRI scanning and angiography may be required to establish the extent
of the disease.
• No speciﬁc immunological tests are helpful. Test for systemic vasculitis
(ANA, ANCA) as part of exclusion criteria.

Treatment
• Treatment is with steroids and cyclophosphamide, as for Wegener’s
granulomatosis. Azathioprine (AZA) and methotrexate (MTX) can be
used to maintain remission.
• The use of cerebral vasodilators (nimodipine, nicardipine) to relieve
vasospasm has also been advocated.

Behçet’s disease
This is a multisystem vasculitis which, unusually, involves veins as well as
arteries. Agreed international criteria for diagnosis are as follows.
• Recurrent oral ulceration with at least two of the following:
• recurrent genital ulceration
• eye lesions
• skin lesions
• pathergy (sterile pustule formation at sites of skin trauma, e.g.
needle puncture sites).

Aetiology and immunopathogenesis
• Histology shows transmural vascular inﬂammation with arterial and
venous involvement.
• The disease is common in eastern Mediterranean countries where
there is a strong association with HLA-B5 (B51) and also an increase in
DR2, DR7, and DR52.

BEHÇET’S DISEASE

• Sporadic cases occur, and these do not have the same MHC
associations.
• Polymorphisms have been identiﬁed in ICAM-1, VEGF, and the FMF
gene (MEFV), among others. The signiﬁcance is unknown.
• The cause of the disease is unknown.
• An abnormal response to antigens from Streptococcus mutans and
possibly Helicobacter pylori antigens has been postulated.
• Immunological features include the following:
• Excessive response of polymorphs to fMLP.
• IgA antibodies to the 65kDa heat shock protein of bacteria.
• Detectable anti-endothelial cell antibodies (these are non-speciﬁc).
• Reduced mannose-binding lectin levels are associated with more
severe disease.
• There are alteration in both Th1 and Th2 subsets and cytokine
production.
• Autoantibodies have been identiﬁed to a range of antigens,
including anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae (ASCA), as in inﬂammatory
bowel disease, retinal-S antigen, other retinal antigens, and antikinectin. None are speciﬁcally diagnostic.

Clinical features and presentation
• The disease is characterized by recurrent orogenital ulceration, similar
to aphthous ulceration but deeper, which may heal with scarring.
• Erythema nodosum may occur.
• Eye disease is often present, including:
• anterior and posterior uveitis
• hypopyon
• retinal vasculitis
• optic atrophy.
• Vascular features include:
• thrombophlebitis
• deep vein thrombosis (DVT)
• arteritis (large vessel).
• Arthralgia/arthritis which is often asymmetric and typically affects large
joints, especially the knees.
• CNS disease is due to vasculitis and typically causes pontine lesions.
• Other CNS complications include:
• pseudotumour cerebri
• myelitis
• meningitis
• dural sinus thrombosis
• organic brain syndromes.
• CNS disease is rare but a poor prognostic marker.
• Pulmonary haemorrhage (with diffuse inﬁltrates).
• Nephritis (rare).
• Gastrointestinal disease: inﬂammatory bowel disease clinically and
histologically similar to Crohn’s disease.
• Venous thrombosis may lead to a Budd-Chiari syndrome and vena
caval obstruction.
• Amyloidosis is a long-term complication (see Chapter 14).

CHAPTER 13

Vasculitis

Diagnosis (see Box 13.5)
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

There are no routine diagnostic markers; diagnosis is clinical.
There is a signiﬁcant acute-phase response.
Complement C9 is often increased.
There are high circulating levels of von Willebrand factor (vWF).
Anti-cardiolipin antibodies may be raised in some cases.
25% of patients may have cryoglobulins.
Immunoglobulins are polyclonally increased.
The MHC-associated cases, but less often sporadic cases, show the
phenomenon of pathergy. Deliberate testing for pathergy can be used
as a diagnostic test.

Treatment
• Treatment is difﬁcult, and is mainly aimed at symptom control.
• Ulceration of the mouth can be treated with topical steroids
(hydrocortisone pellets, triamcinolone paste, steroid sprays for asthma
sprayed directly at ulcers).
• Genital ulceration can be treated with topical steroid creams.
• Arthritis is usually treated with NSAIDs.
• Ulceration may be helped with colchicine or thalidomide.
• Colchicine causes diarrhoea in large doses.
• Thalidomide should not be used in women of child-bearing age
without discussion of the teratogenic risks.
- It causes a neuropathy.
- Detailed consent is required.
- Supplier in the UK requires participation in a formal monitoring
programme.
- Baseline nerve conduction studies are mandatory.
- Risks are signiﬁcant and the beneﬁts often slight.
- Pentoxifylline is an alternative (weak!) oral anti-TNF agent.
• Corticosteroids have a beneﬁcial short-term effect, but there is little
evidence for long-term beneﬁt and chronic use should be avoided.
• Systemic vasculitis warrants the use of ciclosporin, tacrolimus,
azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, or low-dose weekly oral
methotrexate.
• Eye and CNS involvement carries a poor prognosis. Azathioprine,
mycophenolate, ciclosporin, or tacrolimus have been shown to be
of signiﬁcant beneﬁt, although the disease usually relapses when the
drugs are withdrawn.
• Anti-TNF drugs (etanercept, inﬂiximab) are valuable in severe disease.
• Interferon-a2a (3-19mU 3x weekly) is beneﬁcial for intractable
ulceration and in ocular or neurological disease.
• Other drugs that have been used include dapsone and clofazimine.
• 0Anticoagulants need to be used with care and are probably
contraindicated if there is retinal disease. Seek specialist
ophthalomogical advice.

Polyarteritis nodosa (PAN)
Aetiology and immunopathogenesis
• Very strong association with hepatitis B infection.
• Very high incidence in areas where HBV is endemic.
• 10-30% of cases are associated with HBV, although this ﬁgure is higher
in endemic areas.
• Incidence is declining with the increasing use of HBV vaccines.
• Immunoﬂuorescence demonstrates HBV antigens, IgM, and
complement in vessel walls.
• Also associated with tuberculosis and HIV infections.
• There is a very strong link with hairy cell leukaemia, and a PAN-like
vasculitis may be the ﬁrst feature of the leukaemic process.
• It is not an uncommon disease, with a prevalence of 63 per million.
• Necrotizing inﬂammation of medium-sized arteries, causing aneurysmal
dilatation.

Clinical features and presentation
Main clinical features of PAN are:
• fever
• weight loss
• painful nodular skin lesions (which need to be distinguished from those
of erythema nodosum)
• hypertension (often with a tachycardia)
• abdominal pain (cholecystitis may be a feature)
• myalgia
• arthralgia
• mononeuritis multiplex, peripheral neuropathy
• orchitis.

313

314

CHAPTER 13

Vasculitis

Diagnosis (see Box 13.6)
• The major diagnostic features are the presence of micro-aneurysms on
mesenteric and renal angiography and the absence of ANCA.
• The latter is a relatively new deﬁnition as older studies claimed that
ANCA was present in a proportion of cases of PAN.
• Biopsies show that inﬂammatory change is limited to small to mediumsized arteries and there is no evidence of small artery involvement,
which if present would indicate a diagnosis of MPA.
• Testicular and muscle biopsy may be required.
• There is a profound acute-phase response and usually a leucocytosis.
• Poor prognosis is indicated by proteinuria (>3g per 24 hours), renal
insufﬁciency, pancreatitis, and cardiomyopathy.

Treatment
• Treatment is with corticosteroids and cytotoxics, either
cyclophosphamide or azathioprine (as for Wegener’s granulomatosis).
• It has been suggested that vidarabine ± a-IFN (antiviral agents) should
be used for HBV-associated disease in conjunction with plasmapheresis
to reduce the antigenic load. This is still experimental.
• <10% relapse after successful treatment.

CHURG-STRAUSS SYNDROME (CSS)

Churg-Strauss syndrome (CSS)
Aetiology and immunopathogenesis
• CSS is thought to be a subset of PAN in atopic individuals.
• Usually an allergic prodrome that lasts for several years, typically
causing asthma, before the onset of vasculitis.
• May occur in asthmatics treated with leukotriene antagonists although
this may be due to steroid withdrawal in undiagnosed CSS patients.
• Coincidence of upper and lower airway disease suggests that an
inhaled antigen is the trigger, although none has been identiﬁed so far.
• Histology shows necrotizing vasculitis of small to medium arteries and
there is intimal inﬂammation with eosinophilic inﬁltrate. Eosinophilic
granulomata will be seen.
• Levels of eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) are raised in active disease.
This protein is known to be neurotoxic and therefore may account for
some of the neurological sequelae.

Clinical features and presentation
• Onset of the vasculitis is heralded by fever, malaise, and weight loss
• Mononeuritis multiplex is common (up to 80%).
• Other systemic features include:
• GI involvement with bleeding, inﬂammatory-bowel-like symptoms
• cholecystitis
• cardiac involvement with an eosinophilic myocardial ﬁbrosis,
endocarditis, or pericarditis
• cutaneous vasculitic lesions
• sinuses and upper airways are often involved.

Diagnosis (see Box 13.7)
• Diagnosis is mainly one of clinical suspicion, backed up by biopsies.
• Chest radiograph may show inﬁltrates.
• Echocardiography may show pericardial effusions, altered LV function,
and endocarditis.
• Lung function testing is required.
• Imaging of sinuses is useful (CT).
• Normochronic normocytic anaemia is present.
• Marked peripheral blood eosinophilia (>1.5×109/L).
• Measurement of ECP (if available) may be helpful in monitoring the
disease, although it is not a speciﬁc marker for CSS.
• Total IgE is also often raised, although this is less helpful as a diagnostic
or monitoring tool.
• ESR and CRP are markedly elevated.
• Autoantibodies to eosinophil peroxidase may be present, which may
give an atypical ﬂuorescent staining pattern on neutrophil cytospins.
The diagnostic value of this remains uncertain.
• 60% have anti-myeloperoxidase antibodies (P-ANCA) and 10% antiproteinase 3 antibodies (C-ANCA).

Treatment
• Treatment is with steroids and cytotoxics, usually cyclophosphamide,
as for other types of vasculitis.
• Hydroxycarbamide (hydroxyurea) may be considered, as this has
potent anti-eosinophil activity.
• Biologicals used with beneﬁt in small numbers of cases include
rituximab, omalizumab, interferon-A, mepolizumab (anti-IL-5 MAb).
• Therapy with steroids may need to be continued long term to control
asthma. Relapses are common.

Cogan’s syndrome
• This is a rare syndrome of deafness due to cochlear damage, keratitis,
and vasculitis.
• 72% of cases have a systemic necrotizing vasculitis indistinguishable
from PAN.
• Affects particularly large blood vessels, especially the aorta and
coronary vessels (similar to Takayasu’s arteritis).
• Vasculitis may be ﬂorid.
• Although the trigger is not known, the syndrome has been linked to
infections, including Chlamydia and Borrelia.
• No speciﬁc diagnostic tests.
• Antibodies may be detected to inner ear antigens and retinal S antigens.
• These antigens share homology with Ro antigen and also with
Reovirus III major core protein 1.
• Monitoring of hearing and vision is essential.
• Paraproteins may be detected in the serum.
• Usually treated as for Wegener’s granulomatosis, with high-dose
steroids and cyclophosphamide. Ciclosporin has also been used.
• Cochlear implants may be required to restore hearing.

KAWASAKI SYNDROME

Kawasaki syndrome (mucocutaneous
lymph node syndrome)
Aetiology and immunopathogenesis
• Kawasaki syndrome was ﬁrst described in Japan, although it is now
known to occur throughout the world.
• Endemic form is associated with HLA-B51.
• Sometimes also referred to as infantile PAN.
• Histological features of the vascular lesions are identical to those of
PAN.
• Aetiology is obscure but the clustering of cases strongly suggests an
infectious agent.
• Reported possible association with parvovirus B19.
• Has also been suggested, on the basis of T-cell receptor gene usage,
that the disease may be due to super-antigenic stimulation, possibly
caused by staphylococcal or streptococcal super-antigenic toxins.
• It may be associated with polymorphisms in the ITPKC gene, a
negative regulator of T-cell activations.

Clinical features and presentation
• Characterized by a high spiking fever for more than 5 days,
accompanied by:
• bilateral conjunctivitis
• mucosal damage (lips, tongue)
• rash on the hands and feet with desquamation
• diffuse macular exanthem
• cervical lymphadenopathy.
• Other infectious causes must have been excluded.
• Most feared complication is the development of coronary artery
aneurysms, which have a mortality of 1-2% (higher if not recognized).
• Myocardial infarction may occur.
• Aneurysms may also occur elsewhere.

Diagnosis
• There is currently no speciﬁc diagnostic test.
• Both ANCA and AECA are detectable, but these may also be found in
other febrile childhood illnesses.
• High levels of circulating soluble TNF receptor have been noted, but
this is not a routinely available test.
• There is often a thrombocytosis.
• ESR/CRP signiﬁcantly elevated.
• Echocardiography and occasional angiography are required to evaluate
the coronary arteries for evidence of aneurysms.

Treatment
• Treatment of choice is high-dose IVIg (1g/kg/day for 2 days or 2g/kg
as a single dose) together with aspirin (80-100mg/kg/day for 14 days
with monitoring of blood levels), which should begin immediately the
diagnosis is suspected.

317

318

CHAPTER 13

Vasculitis

• This regime prevents the development of coronary artery aneurysms if
begun early, but has no effect once they are established.
• 10% of patients are resistant to IVIg.
• Corticosteroids are not usually used, but may be valuable in resistant
cases. Evidence suggest that use of steroids may increase the risk of
coronary artery aneurysms.
• If aneurysms are documented, low-dose aspirin ± anticoagulants
should be continued.
• Inﬂiximab has been used in a few cases.
• Coronary artery bypass grafting and cardiac transplantation have been
required.
• Although the disease does not generally recur, it has been suggested
(although not proven) that treatment with IVIg increases the risk of
recurrence (about 3% have recurrent disease).

Wegener’s granulomatosis 1
Wegener’s granulomatosis is a multi-system granulomatous vasculitis.

Aetiology and immunopathogenesis
• Cause is unknown.
• Reports that co-trimoxazole may inﬂuence the course of the disease
have raised the possibility that it is triggered by an infection.
• Associated with development of speciﬁc autoantibodies against
proteinase-3 (Pr3, neutrophil granule enzyme).
• Autoantibodies are known to penetrate intact cells and to inhibit the
function of the enzyme by binding near its catalytic site, as well as by
interfering with its inactivation by a1-antitrypsin.
• Autoantibody also potentiates neutrophil functions:
• chemotaxis in response to fMLP
• adhesion to endothelium
• nitric oxide production.
• Pr3 may also be expressed by endothelial cells.
• C-ANCA may increase adhesive and activation molecules (E-selectin,
VCAM-1, ICAM-1) as well as IL-8 production.
• All these effects will enhance the inﬂammatory interaction between
neutrophils and endothelium.

Clinical features and presentation
• Wegener’s granulomatosis occurs in two forms:
• systemic disease, which always includes a necrotizing
glomerulonephritis
• a limited form, in which the disease tends to be localized (upper
and lower respiratory tract) without renal involvement.
• In both forms there is often a prolonged prodrome of malaise,
arthralgia, and myalgia.

WEGENER’S GRANULOMATOSIS 2: DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT

• The limited form presents typically with involvement of the upper and
lower respiratory tracts.
• Sinusitis and otitis are common.
• Nasal crusting, ulceration, and bleeding occur.
• Nasal cartilage is often eroded, leading to gradual collapse of the
bridge of the nose.
• Subglottic stenosis is very typical and leads to acute presentation
with stridor.
• There may be haemoptysis and the chest radiograph may show
multiple ‘cannon ball’ lesions, often with cavitation.
• Endobronchial disease may also occur, causing lower respiratory
obstruction.
• More central involvement of the head may lead to proptosis and
obstruction to the draining veins.
• Erosion into main head and neck arteries may also occur.
• Skin involvement may include a leucocytoclastic vasculitis.
• Other complications include parotid enlargement, endocarditis
(similar to Libman-Sacks endocarditis), transverse myelitis,
peripheral neuropathy, and granulomatous bowel disease.
Episcleritis and uveitis may occur.
• The limited form rarely develops into the systemic form.
• The limited form may be locally invasive with considerable
morbidity and mortality.
• The systemic form tends to present as fulminant renal failure, often
with pulmonary involvement, high fever, arthralgia, and malaise.
Features seen in limited disease will also be found.
• Lung lesions may be mistaken for tumours.

Wegener’s granulomatosis 2:
diagnosis and treatment
Diagnosis (see Box 13.8)
• Diagnostic test is presence of ANCA.
• Major target antigen is proteinase 3.
• 95% of patients with will have detectable ANCA, of whom 85%
will have C-ANCA (anti-proteinase 3) and 10% P-ANCA (antimyeloperoxidase).
• Anti-neutrophil elastase antibodies have also been detected (P-ANCA
pattern on immunoﬂuorescence).
• Approximately 5% of cases are seronegative.
• Biopsy is also important and will show the granulomatous vasculitis,
often with ﬁbrinoid necrosis.
• Renal biopsy will usually show a necrotizing glomerulonephritis.
• Other features include:
• normochromic, normocytic anaemia
• thrombocytosis
• leucocytosis (occasional leukaemoid reactions)
• slight eosinophilia (distinguish from CSS).

CHAPTER 13

Vasculitis

•
•
•
•

Acute-phase responses (ESR/CRP) are marked.
Rheumatoid factors are detectable in about 50%.
Immunoglobulins are usually normal.
Monitor disease with acute-phase markers (CRP/ESR) and serial
ANCA measurements.
• Antibody titre does not correlate with the degree of disease
activity.
• Rising titre may herald relapse, but not always.
• This is not affected by secondary infection, which will elevate the
CRP.
• ANCA remain positive for many years after clinical remission has
been obtained and treatment withdrawn.
• Disease activity is also marked by an increase in soluble CD25 (IL-2
receptor), vWF, soluble ICAM-1, and thrombomodulin, but none of
these additional markers have been critically evaluated.
• Renal function must be monitored regularly, and the urine sediment
inspected for evidence of glomerular damage.
• Indium-labelled leucocyte or gallium-67 scanning may be useful for
deﬁning sites of disease activity.

LYMPHOMATOID GRANULOMATOSIS

Treatment
• The gold standard of treatment is steroids, given either orally or as
intravenous pulses, with cyclophosphamide, given as either continuous
oral therapy or pulsed intravenous/oral therapy.
• Continuous oral cyclophosphamide therapy may be more effective but
may increase risk of long-term side effects (bladder neoplasia, myeloid
leukaemia).
• IV cyclophosphamide must be accompanied by mesna to prevent
haemorrhagic custitis.
• Azathioprine and mycophenolate mofetil are not used for induction of
remission but may be used for maintenance therapy.
• Low-dose weekly methotrexate (20-30mg/week) has also been
effective as maintenance therapy (avoid where there is liver disease or
renal impairment).
• Co-trimoxazole may have a disease-modifying effect, but should only
be used as sole agent when there is upper airway disease only.
• All patients should receive low-dose treatment with this agent as
prophylaxis against Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia secondary to
immunosuppression. Do not use with methotrexate. Azithromycin
or atovaquone are alternatives
• Ciclosporin (up to 5mg/kg/day, with monitoring of blood levels) may
be effective in combination with steroids.
• High-dose IVIg (0.4g/kg/day for 5 days, repeated monthly) has been
suggested as an alternative in small uncontrolled trials and in one small
controlled trial.
• Other therapies used in resistant disease include alemtuzumab
(anti-CD52, Campath), rituximab, inﬂiximab, and 15-deoxyspergualin.
• Tracheostomy may be required for laryngeal disease.

Lymphomatoid granulomatosis
Aetiology and immunopathogenesis
• An unusual condition in which there is a lymphocytic proliferation and
inﬁltration affecting mainly small arteries and veins.
• May mimic Wegener’s granulomatosis, but it is not a true vasculitis.
• EBV+ B-cell lymphoproliferation, accompanied by T-cell reaction.
• Occurs in patients with autoimmune diseases and in association with
HIV.
• May be difﬁcult to distinguish from angiocentric lymphoma. May be an
unusual lymphoma variant.

Clinical features
Key clinical features include the following.
• Lung involvement with breathlessness and cough.
• Radiographic evidence of multiple nodules.
• Upper airways involvement, including sinuses, is common and may
mimic lethal midline granuloma.
• Skin lesions, including nodules and ulcers, present in >50% of patients.

321

322

CHAPTER 13

Vasculitis

• Renal involvement with proteinuria and haematuria.
• CNS involvement is either due to mass lesions or is a more diffuse
process due to vascular inﬁltration.
• Lymph node and splenic enlargements are very rare and the lack of
these helps distinguish the condition from true lymphoma.
• Myalgia and arthralgia occur.

Diagnosis
• No speciﬁc diagnostic test other than biopsy.

Treatment
• Treatment comprises steroids plus cyclophosphamide, although the
difﬁculty in distinguishing the disease from lymphoma has meant that
aggressive lymphoma protocols have also been used.
• Irradiation may be useful for localized disease.

Giant-cell arteritis (GCA) and
polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR)
Aetiology and immunopathogenesis
• These two diseases are closely associated and predominantly affect the
elderly, with a peak incidence in the over-70s.
• May occur in younger patients where the diagnosis may not be
considered.
• Almost exclusively Caucasian diseases.
• Female predominance of 3:1.
• Rare in Blacks.
• Incidence is >170 per million, making them common diseases.
• Known association with HLA-DR4.
• Cause is unknown, although they may occur in association with acute
myeloid leukaemia and HTLV-1 infection.
• Limited clonality of T cells suggests localized antigenic stimulus.
• Macrophages produce high levels of IL-1 and IL-6.

Clinical features and presentation
• Typical presentation of GCA is with headache, fever, and an anaemia
of chronic disease.
• Temporal arteries are often swollen, red, and tender.
• Other features of GCA include:
• jaw/tongue claudication
• sudden blindness (occurs in 10% through retinal artery occlusion or
cortical blindness)
• extra-ocular muscle palsies
• ischaemic symptoms in arms and legs
• stroke
• myocardial infarction
• inﬂammatory aneurysms of the aorta and large branches
• pyrexia of unknown origin (PUO) in the elderly.

TAKAYASU’S DISEASE (AORTIC ARCH SYNDROME)

• GCA is a systemic vasculitis, not just a localized (temporal artery)
vasculitis.
• Features of PMR include:
• limb girdle pain
• marked morning stiffness
• mild synovitis without erosive disease.

Diagnosis
• No speciﬁc immunological tests at present.
• Diagnosis is clinical backed up by temporal artery biopsy.
• A reasonable length of artery should be removed as the disease
process is often patchy.
• Pan-arteritis is present.
• There is an inﬁltrate of T cells, predominantly CD4+ T cells, and
macrophages, with giant cells.
• Inﬁltrating T cells are of limited clonality.
• Pre-treatment for up to a week with steroids will not abolish the
typical appearances.
• Scanning (MRI) and angiography (MRA) may be required to delineate
the extent of disease in major vessels (aorta and branches).
• Acute-phase response (CRP/ESR) is marked.
• Occasional patients lack an acute-phase response, despite evidence
of disease on biopsy.
• Normochromic normocytic anaemia is usual.
• Immunoglobulins and complement are normal.

Treatment
• For GCA, use high-dose steroids (60-100mg/day initially), which are
reduced rapidly to maintenance levels (7.5-10mg/day) and continued
for 18-24 months.
• The minimum required to keep the disease suppressed is used, as
determined by suppression of the acute-phase response and clinical
symptoms.
• CRP is more useful for monitoring than ESR.
• Failure to control the disease with high-dose steroids may require the
use of cytotoxic agents such as azathioprine or cyclophosphamide.
• Treatment of PMR in the absence of GCA requires lower-dose
steroids, usually not more than 20mg/day.
• The diseases usually burn out over several years and treatment can be
withdrawn, although some cases grumble on for even longer periods.

Takayasu’s disease (aortic arch
syndrome)
Aetiology and immunopathogenesis
• Predominantly a disease of Oriental patients.
• Strong association with HLA-B52, and also B39.
• 85% of cases are women.

323

324

CHAPTER 13

Vasculitis

• Age of onset is usually <40 years, often in teenage girls and young
women.
• Histology shows a granulomatous inﬁltrate of multinucleate giant cells
with a patchy distribution.
• Disease begins in the media and there is intimal proliferation.
• Circulating immune complexes have been demonstrated.
• In the late phase (pulseless), there is transmural sclerosis.

Clinical features and presentation
• There is a pre-pulseless phase with exertional dyspnoea, cough, and
tachycardia.
• After a variable interval, there is a subacute presentation with fever,
malaise, night sweats, nausea, and upper/lower limb claudication.
• Examination will reveal widespread arterial bruits.
• Erythema nodosum may occur.
• There is often an arthralgia with a synovitis.
• Disease may be associated with adult or juvenile rheumatoid arthritis
or spondylitis.
• May involve the coronary arteries.
• Aorta and/or pulmonary arteries are involved in 50% of patients.
• Other complications include headache, stroke, visual loss, interstitial
lung disease, pulmonary hypertension, renovascular hypertension, and
glomerulonephritis.
• Takayasu’s retinopathy is due to ischaemia.
• Five types are recognized, depending on arterial involvement.
• Type IA: ascending aorta, aortic arch, and arch vessels without
aneurysms.
• Type IB: as for IA but with aneurysms.
• Type II: thoraco-abdominal aorta.
• Type III: aortic arch and thoraco-abdominal aorta.
• Type IV: pulmonary arteries.
• In pregnancy disease may be accelerated, with marked hypertension.
• Disease may burn out after 5 years, leaving vascular scarring with
multiple bruits.

Diagnosis
• No diagnostic test, apart from angiography (MRA) and biopsy.
• The acute-phase response, (ESR/CRP) is high in the early acute
inﬂammatory phase of the disease.
• Immunoglobulins are elevated in some cases.
• Anaemia and leucocytosis are present on full blood count.
• Anti-aorta antibodies and AECA have been demonstrated.
• Proteinuria (mild) and haematuria may occur.

Treatment
• In the inﬂammatory stage, the disease responds to high-dose steroids.
• Cytotoxic agents (cyclophosphamide, methotrexate) may be used
when there is a poor response to steroids.
• Surgery or percutaneous angioplasty with stenting may be required to
bypass sclerotic narrowed arteries in the endstage of the disease.

URTICARIAL VASCULITIS (HUV)

Urticarial vasculitis
(hypocomplementaemic urticarial
vasculitis (HUV))
Aetiology and immunopathogenesis
• Three types are recognized.
• normocomplementaemic variant—idiopathic and benign
• hypocomplementaemic variant in association with other CTD
• hypocomplementaemic variant in association with autoantibody to
C1q.
• Marked female predominance.
• An autoantibody to the collagenous region of C1q may be found and
activates the classical pathway of complement. A similar syndrome may
also occur with C3-nephritic factor (see Part 2).
• May occur with SLE.

Clinical features and presentation
• Recurrent bouts of prolonged atypical urticaria, persisting for >24
hours (may be up to 72 hours) and fading to leave brown pigmentation
due to extravasated red cells.
• Skin lesions tend to be painful and burn rather than itch.
• Often accompanied by arthritis (non-erosive); glomerulonephritis in
40%.
• Frequently occurs in association with other connective diseases: SLE,
Sjögren’s syndrome, and cryoglobulinaemia.
• Obstructive lung disease (worse in smokers) and cardiac valve disease
may occur.
• Ocular inﬂammation.

Diagnosis
• Typical skin lesions—biopsy will conﬁrm evidence of vasculitis
(leucocytoclastic).
• Increased acute-phase response.
• Renal biopsies show granular IgG along the glomerular basement
membrane.
• CH100 is low/absent, and C1q, C2, and C4 are reduced.
• Detection of antibody to C1q.

Treatment
• Steroids, antimalarials, colchicine, or dapsone (impairs chemotaxis and
lysosomal activity of neutrophils and neutrophil adherence—check
G6PD levels ﬁrst!).
• Immunosuppressive therapy with corticosteroids, azathioprine,
cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, or mycophenolate have all been
used in severe cases.
• Plasmapheresis may be used (beware rebound if not combined with
B-cell immunosuppression).
• Severe cases may respond well to rituximab.

325

326

CHAPTER 13

Vasculitis

Erythema elevatum diutinum
• An exceptionally rare disease, mainly in the elderly (although it may
occur in girls in childhood).
• Characterized by:
• cutaneous purpuric lesions accompanied by persistent red/orange
plaques (like xanthomata)
• violaceous nodules over extensor surfaces.
• Histology of fresh lesions shows a leucocytoclastic vasculitis.
• Older lesions show evidence of lipid deposition, with histiocytes.
• Immunoglobulins are increased.
• May occur in HIV infection (mimics Kaposi’s sarcoma) and in
association with myeloma (especially IgA), hairy cell leukaemia,
cryoglobulinaemia, and coeliac disease.
• Thought to be due to an aberrant immune response to a pathogen
(undeﬁned).
• First-line treatment is dapsone.
• Sulfapyridine and corticosteroids are also used.
• Cyclophosphamide and chlorambucil used where IgA is elevated.

Degos’s syndrome
• Rare syndrome of occlusive vasculitis with multiple cutaneous,
mesenteric, and CNS infarcts.
• Skin lesions typically crops of painless papules evolving into ‘porcelain
drop’ lesions.
• Mainly occurs in older Caucasians.
• Histology shows multiple infarcts with inﬁltrates of scant lymphocytes
and monocytes.
• Cause is uncertain; activated T cells may play a role.
• A viral aetiology has been proposed.
• Treatment is unsatisfactory. Steroids and cytotoxics are unhelpful;
aspirin and anticoagulation may help.

Erythema nodosum
Aetiology and immunopathogenesis
• This is a form of small-vessel vasculitis particularly affecting the fat of
the subcutaneous tissue.
• It is invariably secondary to an infective or toxic insult.
• The causes are multitudinous, but worldwide the most common cause
is mycobacterial infection (TB and leprosy).
• In the UK the most common causes are:
• streptococcal infection
• sarcoidosis.
• It may also be caused by other infections:
• viral (EBV)
• fungal (histoplasma, blastomycosis)

WEBER-CHRISTIAN DISEASE (RELAPSING FEBRILE PANNICULITIS)

• bacterial (Yersinia, tularaemia, cat scratch disease, lymphogranuloma
venereum).
• It is also associated with:
• inﬂammatory bowel disease
• Behçet’s syndrome
• leukaemia and lymphoma
• pregnancy
• oral contraceptive pill
• sulphonamides.

Clinical features and presentation
• Characteristic features are of red hot painful swellings on the shins,
and less commonly on the arms.
• These resolve slowly, often with desquamation of the skin, leaving a
brown pigmented area.
• May recur if the underlying disease is not identiﬁed.
• There is often fever, malaise, and arthralgia.

Diagnosis
• The most important investigation is the patient’s history, including
drugs and travel, followed by a chest radiograph.
• Other investigations will be determined by the type of precipitant
suspected.
• Acute-phase response will be markedly elevated.

Treatment
• Treatment is primarily for the underlying disease.
• NSAIDs relieve the discomfort.
• Corticosteroids also relieve the pain but do not speed resolution.

Weber-Christian disease (relapsing
febrile panniculitis)
Aetiology and immunpathogenesis
• Rare inﬁltrative inﬂammatory disease of fat.
• Typically occurs in young Caucasian females.

Clinical features
•
•
•
•

Tender skin nodules.
Fever.
Arthralgia.
Myalgia.

Diagnosis
• Skin biopsy.
• Small vessel vasculitis may be present.

327

328

CHAPTER 13

Vasculitis

Treatment
• No gold standard treatment.
• NSAIDS, corticosteroids, tetracycline, antimalarials, thalidomide, and
immunosuppressive drugs have been tried.

Relapsing polychondritis
Aetiology and immunpathogenesis
•
•
•
•
•
•

•
•
•

Rare autoimmune disease affecting cartilage.
Disease of middle age and older.
Sex incidence is equal.
20% of patients have antibodies to type II collagen, but these have little
diagnostic or predictive value.
Matrilin-1 may also be a target antigen.
HLA-DR4 is present in 56% of patients compared with 25% of
controls, but there is no association with particular HLA-DRB1 alleles
and no association with HLA-B27, despite the similarities to ankylosing
spondylitis.
There is a mononuclear cell inﬁltrate of cartilage.
There is a necrotizing vasculitis of small/medium-sized blood vessels,
accompanied by a cutaneous vasculitis.
Immunoglobulin and complement deposits are found at sites of
inﬂammation.

Clinical features and presentation
• Typically affects the cartilage of the nose and the pinna of the ear,
which become red and exceedingly painful.
• More rarely, it is associated with damage to the cartilage of the trachea
(causing respiratory failure), larynx (causing hoarseness), cardiac valve
rings (causing aortic incompetence), and costochondral junctions.
• There is often a non-deforming arthritis, hearing loss, fever, and
malaise.
• It is a rare cause of PUO.
• Eye involvement includes episcleritis, iritis, and conjunctivitis.
• Course may be ﬂuctuating.
• It is important to distinguish it from Wegener’s granulomatosis,
Cogan’s syndrome, infectious causes, and chondrodermatitis nodularis
chronica helicis, which is limited to the ear.
• A focal chondritis may be seen in SLE.

Diagnosis
• The acute-phase response is marked (ESR, CRP and complement).
• Full blood count shows the anaemia of chronic disease and
leucocytosis.
• Low-titre RhF, C-ANCA, P-ANCA, and ANA may be seen.
• Regular lung function with a ﬂow-volume loop is required to
demonstrate tracheomalacia.
• MRI of the upper airways is valuable.

INFECTION AS A TRIGGER OF VASCULITIS

Treatment
• NSAIDs where the disease is mild.
• Steroids ± cyclophosphamide or ciclosporin where the disease is more
widespread.
• Dapsone has also been used.
• Aortic valve replacement and tracheal stents may be required.

Cystic ﬁbrosis
• Patients with CF may develop a vasculitis.
• This has been associated with the presence of atypical ANCA.
• Speciﬁcity of these ANCAs has been shown to be against the
bactericidal/permeability increasing (BPI) protein of neutrophil
granules.
• Disorder is likely to be triggered by the chronic infection present in CF
patients, although the precise relationship remains to be determined.
• Vasculitis is a poor prognostic marker.

Infection as a trigger of vasculitis
• Many of the vasculitides discussed above are suspected, or known, to
be triggered by infection.
• Causes include the following.
• Direct microbial invasion of the vascular tree: cryptococcal aortitis,
Aspergillus, Salmonella, Pseudomonas.
• Septic emboli.
• Replication of the pathogen in endothelial cells: rickettsial vasculitis
(rickettsia are found in endothelial cells of gangrenous limbs).
• VZV in immunosuppressed patients with lymphoma (cutaneous
vasculitis with VZV in endothelial cells).
• HIV is recognized to cause a wide range of vasculitis responses,
including PAN and HSP-like small vessel vasculitis (leucocytoclastic
and neutrophilic), and may also include cerebral vasculitis.
• Tuberculosis may cause a PAN-like disease.
• CMV vasculitis accounts for gastrointestinal ulceration, pneumonitis,
and skin lesions (ulcers).
• Syphilis (now rare in the UK) causes an endarteritis.
• Borrelia is associated with a vasculitis, particularly accounting for the
CNS features (Lyme disease).
• Bartonella is also associated with a vasculitis.
• Mechanisms may include:
• immune complex deposition and complement activation with
secondary recruitment of inﬂammatory cells
• type IV hypersensitivity with granuloma formation and activation of
T cells, with either direct tissue damage or cytokine release
• cross-reactive antibodies against pathogens may directly damage
host components: this may involve the generation of cryoglobulins
(e.g. in HBV).

329

330

CHAPTER 13

Vasculitis

Malignancy-associated vasculitis
• Vasculitis may occur as a paraneoplastic phenomenon.
• Examples include the following:
• Association of PAN with hairy cell leukaemia (strong association;
vasculitis resolves with HCL treatment, which includes A-IFN).
• Leucocytoclastic vasculitis has been associated with
myelomonocytic leukaemia, T-cell lymphoma, Wilm’s tumour, and
renal cell carcinoma.
• Vasculitis is strongly associated with chronic NK-cell lymphocytosis
(urticarial vasculitis, PAN, and acute glomerulonephritis).
• Neoplasms may also present as ‘vasculitis’.
• Myxoma (diagnose by demonstration of myxomatous material on
biopsy).
• Angiocentric T-cell lymphoma (cutaneous lesions, mainly in the
elderly) mimics PAN, WG, and LG.
• Vasculitis may present as a neoplasm.
• Wegener’s and lymphomatoid granulomatosis.
• PAN: a testicular presentation of PAN is often confused with
testicular tumours. Biopsy will distinguish between the two and
prevent unnecessary orchidectomy.

Drug-related vasculitis
• Drug-related vasculitis accounts for 10-20% of all dermatological
vasculitis.
• Presentation may be at any time after the drug has been started,
including after many years of therapy.
• Often accompanied by fever, arthralgia, hepatitis, and
lymphadenopathy.
• Systemic vascular involvement is variable and may include lung, heart,
CNS, and kidney.
• There may be typical features of serum sickness.
• Any drug is potentially capable of triggering a vasculitic reaction.
• More common causes include:
• aspirin
• penicillin
• thiazides
• sulphonamides
• AZT
• cytokines—α-IFN (which may actually be used to treat vasculitis
associated with HBV and HCV) and colony stimulating factors
such as G-CSF (the vasculitis is related to the increasing neutrophil
count).
• Rare cases have been reported with illicit drugs (amphetamines,
cocaine, heroin, LSD), but in many of the reports the role of hepatitis
viruses has not been excluded.

CRYOGLOBULINAEMIA AND CRYOFIBRINOGENAEMIA

Vasculitis secondary to connective
tissue and other autoimmune diseases
• Vasculitis is a well-recognized feature of all the connective tissue
diseases.
• Rheumatoid vasculitis is a small vessel vasculitis characterized by:
• very high levels of rheumatoid factor
• atypical ANCA against elastase and lactoferrin (P-ANCA)—not
speciﬁc for rheumatoid vasculitis.
• Sjögren’s syndrome is associated with vasculitis in 5-10% of cases. This
is characterized by:
• purpura
• recurrent urticaria
• skin ulceration
• mononeuritis multiplex
• Raynaud’s phenomenon (common)
• bowel infarction from systemic vasculitis (rare)
• glomerulonephritis (rare)
• hypergammaglobulinaemia
• high-titre RhF
• anti-Ro antibodies (especially with purpuric lesions)
• cryoglobulins are usual (mixed, type II with IgMκ paraprotein)
• Treatment of SS is with steroids ± cyclophosphamide.
• SLE, systemic sclerosis, dermatomyositis/polymyositis, inﬂammatory
bowel disease, PBC, and Goodpasture’s syndrome are all associated
with medium to small vessel vasculitis.
• Sneddon’s syndrome is a complex of livedo reticularis and endarteritis
obliterans, especially of medium-sized cerebral arteries, leading to strokes.
It is often associated with anti-phospholipid antibodies (LAC or ACA).

Cryoglobulinaemia and
cryoﬁbrinogenaemia
Cryoglobulinaemia
• Mixed essential mixed cryoglobulinaemia (type II) (see Part 2) is
associated with:
• purpura (leucocytoclastic vasculitis)
• Raynaud’s phenomenon
• arthralgia
• severe peripheral neuropathy
• Sjögren’s syndrome
• glomerulonephritis
• liver disease.
• There is usually an IgMκ paraprotein with RhF activity and evidence of
a low-grade lymphoproliferative disease.

331

332

CHAPTER 13

Vasculitis

• Disease is very common in northern Italy, where there is a major
association with chronic HCV infection.
• Less commonly found in HBV and EBV infections.
• Other chronic bacteraemic infections, such as shunt nephritis and lowgrade endocarditis, may also lead to cryoglobulin formation.
• Complement studies show low C1, C2, and C4.
• Plasma viscosity is increased.
• Some patients with glomerulonephritis have an antibody to a 50kDa
renal antigen, although the nature of the antigen is unknown.
• Plasmapheresis may be required and A-IFN, with ribavirin, may be tried
in order to eliminate HCV.

Cryoﬁbrinogenaemia
• This behaves in a very similar manner to cryoglobulinaemia, with coldrelated purpura, haemorrhagic ulcers, and thrombosis of superﬁcial
blood vessels in exposed extremities.
• It may be idiopathic or associated with malignancy (see Part 2).

Hypergammaglobulinaemic purpura of
Waldenström and cholesterol emboli
Hypergammaglobulinaemic purpura of Waldenström
• Benign disease characterized by purpuric lesions and a polyclonal
increase in immunoglobulins.
• High levels of immune complexes can be detected.
• There is a cutaneous necrotizing vasculitis.
• Cause is unknown.
• Treatment is not required.

Cholesterol emboli
•
•
•
•

These may mimic vasculitis, with a PAN-like pattern of skin lesions.
Fever, myalgia, high ESR, hypertension, and eosinophilia also occur.
Skin biopsy demonstrates the presence of cholesterol clefts.
May arise following invasive vascular investigations as well as
spontaneously.
• Symptoms may be chronic.

Atrial myxoma and serum sickness
Atrial myxoma
• Atrial myxomas mimic vasculitis when emboli are shed.
• Emboli appear in distal small blood vessels and give the typical
appearances of small cutaneous vasculitic lesions with multiple splinter
haemorrhages.
• More serious embolic lesions are the major complication (strokes).

WEBSITES

• Appearances are very similar to those of SBE.
• Tumour ‘plop’ associated with prolapse of the tumour through the
mitral valve may be identiﬁed on cardiac auscultation.
• Tumours may secrete high levels of IL-6 and therefore are
accompanied by malaise, fever, an elevated CRP/ESR, and a polyclonal
increase in immunoglobulins.
• The diagnostic test is echocardiography.
• Treatment is surgical removal.
• As the tumours are benign, removal is curative and recurrence is
unlikely.

Serum sickness
• Characterized by fever, polyarthritis, lymphadenopathy, and urticaria
7-14 days after primary exposure and 1-3 days after secondary
exposure to foreign proteins or drug-modiﬁed self-proteins (e.g. with
penicillin).
• Acute venulitis and occasionally systemic vasculitis may occur.
• CRP will be high and ESR will rise during the illness.
• Complement levels may fall acutely and there will be an increase in C3
breakdown products.
• Renal function may deteriorate temporarily.
• Treatment is symptomatic; corticosteroids may help.
• The illness is usually self-limiting as the immune complexes are cleared.

CHAPTER 14

Miscellaneous conditions

Sarcoidosis
Sarcoidosis is a multisystem disease characterized by non-caseating
granulomata.

Presentation
• Common presentations include:
• asymptomatic bihilar lymphadenopathy
• erythema nodosum, arthritis, and hilar lymphadenopathy (Löfgren’s
syndrome)
• uveo-parotid fever (von Heerfordt’s syndrome)
• primary cerebral involvement
• multisystem presentation, which can affect all organs in the body.
• Other clinical features include erythema nodosum, arthralgias,
skin involvement (lupus pernio), and symptoms and signs of
hypercalcaemia.

Cause and immunopathogenesis
• Formation of non-caseating granulomata is typical, but is not by itself
diagnostic.
• Differential diagnosis of non-caseating granulomata is extensive and
includes:
• infections (Toxoplasma, Bartonella)
• lymphoma
• carcinoma
• berylliosis, due to beryllium exposure
• vasculitis and connective tissue diseases
• Crohn’s disease
• chronic granulomatous disease.
• Granuloma comprises a central area of macrophages, epithelioid cells,
and Langerhans giant cells surrounded by lymphocytes (mainly CD4+
cells and plasma cells), monocytes, and ﬁbroblasts.
• Macrophages are activated and release enzymes and 1,25dihydroxycholecalciferol—hence the tendency to hypercalcaemia.
• IL-12 is released; IL-18 associated with granuloma formation.
• Peripheral blood lymphopenia (T and B cells), cutaneous anergy, and
poor in vitro tests of lymphocyte proliferation.
• T cells have an ‘activated’ phenotype, and T-cell receptor studies
show skewing of the VB chain usage which might be compatible with a
response to a single, as yet unidentiﬁed, pathogen.
• Disease manifestations are of a Th1 phenotype.
• Serum immunoglobulins are elevated, and as a result low-level
autoantibodies may be present. IgM anti-T-cell antibodies may be
detected.
• Bronchoalveolar lavage specimens show a lymphocytosis
(predominantly CD4+ T cells with high levels of activation and
adhesion markers) and monocytes/macrophages (also activated with
elevated MHC class II).
• Soluble activation markers, such as sIL-2R, are raised.

SARCOIDOSIS

Investigations (see Box 14.1)
• No speciﬁc diagnostic tests are available for sarcoidosis.
• Raised ACE levels in about 60% of patients (released by epithelioid
cells in the granulomata).
• Hypercalcaemia (and hypercalciuria).
• Serum immunoglobulins show a polyclonal elevation of all classes, but
predominantly IgG.
• Low-titre rheumatoid factors and anti-nuclear antibodies may be
present.
• Peripheral blood lymphocyte analysis will show a generalized
lymphopenia, with a proportional reduction in all cell types.
• DTH testing will show anergy. There is no clinical need to assess
lymphocyte proliferation in vitro, although it will be reduced.
• Biopsy with appropriate immunohistochemical staining is helpful.
• The Kveim test, in which an extract of sarcoid spleen is injected under
the skin and biopsied 4-6 weeks later, has been used previously: a
granuloma forms at the site of injection. This test, which uses human
material, is no longer considered appropriate.
• BAL studies are helpful where there is interstitial lung disease, although
the changes are not speciﬁc.
• A gallium-67 scan is helpful in identifying granulomata.
• CSF oligoclonal bands may be present (again not speciﬁc) in cerebral
sarcoidosis.
• Lung function testing and appropriate radiological studies are essential.

CHAPTER 14

Miscellaneous conditions

Treatment
• Asymptomatic disease picked up by chance on chest radiography;
requires no speciﬁc treatment.
• Treat erythema nodosum with NSAIDs intially.
• Symptomatic disease requires low- to moderate-dose steroids.
• Occasionally patients require other immunosuppressive drugs
as steroid-sparing agents (cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and
azathioprine). Ciclosporin and hydroxychloroquine may be helpful
through their effects on T-lymphocyte activation. Inﬂiximab has also
been used.
• Patients with uveitis may require aggressive treatment to preserve
vision.
• Progressive lung disease may be an indication for lung transplantation,
but disease recurs in 30-80% of cases.

Prognosis
• Asymptomatic disease usually resolves spontaneously over several
years.
• Symptomatic disease is frequently chronic.

Amyloidosis
This group of conditions which cause multisystem disease is often overlooked clinically. The diseases are characterized by the deposition of
polymerized proteins in an insoluble B-pleated sheet form, either generally or in a single organ, depending on the type of polymerizing protein
(Table 14.1). Once deposits are established, they are virtually impossible
to eliminate. Multiple proteins have been associated with amyloid formation. Hereditary forms occur.

AL amyloid
Presentation
• Typical clinical features include:
• hepatosplenomegaly
• cardiac failure due to inﬁltration
• malabsorption
• nephrotic syndrome
• peripheral neuropathy (especially carpal tunnel syndrome)
• macroglossia may be present
• deposits may occur in the skin
• bleeding tendency due to selective absorption of clotting factors.
• It is a disease predominantly of older people.

339

340

CHAPTER 14

Miscellaneous conditions

Cause and immunopathogenesis
• In this type of amyloid the deposited protein is derived from
immunoglobulin light chains (λ:κ = 2:1—the opposite of that found in
myeloma).
• Often associated with evidence of lymphoproliferative disease.
• 20% of AL amyloid patients only have myeloma; the rest have other
paraproteinaemias.
• Rarely, AL amyloid has been associated with heavy-chain deposition.

Investigations (see Box 14.2)
• Serum and urine should be checked for the presence of monoclonal
immunoglobulins and free light chains: sensitive techniques may be
required to demonstrate the paraproteins, which are present in up to
80% of cases.
• Paraprotein levels are often low.
• Serum-free light-chain analysis is very valuable.
• Some paraproteins may not be detected as the light chain is highly
abnormal or polymerized in circulation, such that it does not react
with the usual antisera, or the band overlaps on electrophoresis with
other protein bands.
• Biopsy of an affected organ and Congo red staining, which gives applegreen birefringence, is helpful. More speciﬁc immunostaining with antilight-chain antisera may give reactions, although the distorted protein
structure may prevent reactivity.
• Bone marrow examination is essential.

Treatment
• No curative treatment, but steroids, melphalan, and colchicine may
slow down the rate of progression; symptomatic organ-speciﬁc
treatment will be required.
• HSCT may be necessary.
• Iododoxorubicin binds to AL amyloid and promotes resorption.
• Bortezomib (Velcade®), a proteasome inhibitor, may be helpful.

OTHER ACQUIRED AMYLOIDOSES

AA amyloid
Presentation
• Presents predominantly with hepatosplenomegaly, nephrotic
syndrome, and malabsorption.
• Cardiac and nerve involvement is rare.

Cause and immunopathogenesis
• Caused by the polymerization of serum amyloid A protein (SAA), an
acute-phase protein, whose levels rise in response to IL-1 and IL-6.
• It is a complication of chronic infection or inﬂammation (TB,
bronchiectasis, rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, etc.).
• It is a complication of periodic fever syndromes:
• familial Mediterranean fever (see p.342)
• hyper-IgD syndrome (see p.344)
• TRAPS (see p.343)
• Muckle-Wells syndrome (see p.344)
• familial cold urticaria (see p.345).

Investigations
• Biopsies will conﬁrm the presence of the amyloid deposits, and the
serum will contain high levels of acute-phase proteins (e.g. CRP).
• SAA can be measured routinely, especially in amyloidogeneic
conditions, such as the autoinﬂammatory diseases, on treatment.
• SAP scans may help localize deposits.

Treatment
• Treatment is aimed at the underlying disease to eliminate the drive to
high levels of SAA.
• Colchicine is a valuable prophylatic agent in some periodic fever
syndromes.

Other acquired amyloidoses
Dialysis amyloid
• Caused by the polymerization of B2-microglobulin (AB2MG).
• Related to failure of certain older (cuprophane) haemodialysis
membranes to clear B2MG. Current membranes do not have this
problem to the same extent.
• Widespread deposition of B2MG occurs, but these deposits may
resolve slowly with a successful transplant or on switching to dialysis
with more permeable membranes.
• Serum B2MG levels will rise to very high levels (>20mg/L).

Prion disease
• Amyloid deposition has been associated with prions in Creutzfeldt-
Jakob disease (CJD), where the prion protein PrP mutates and
becomes amyloidogenic.

341

342

CHAPTER 14

Miscellaneous conditions

Alzheimer’s disease
• B-amyloid protein has also been identiﬁed in certain cases of Alzheimer’s
disease and is associated with the typical neuroﬁbrillary tangles.
• Protein is derived from a larger precursor amyloid B-precursor protein
(ABPP). In Alzheimer’s it appears that the processing is defective,
leading to an abnormal B-amyloid.

Diabetes
• Amyloid deposits are found in patients with type II maturity-onset
diabetes.
• Amyloidogenic protein is thought to be islet amyloid polypeptide
(IAPP), which is normally co-secreted with insulin.
• This type of amyloid may occur in association with insulinomas.

Senile cardiac amyloid
• Senile cardiac amyloid is very common in the elderly and is due to
deposition of polymerized atrial natriuretic factor.

Medullary thyroid carcinoma
• Medullary thyroid carcinoma may be associated with a form of amyloid
derived from pro-calcitonin and calcitonin.

Inherited amyloidosis
• There are a number of rare inherited amyloid deposition diseases
related to rare mutations in proteins. These include:
• transthyretin
• apolipoprotein A-I
• gelsolin
• ﬁbrinogen
• cystatin C
• lysozyme.
• Clinical features are variable but renal and neurological involvement,
both central and peripheral, are common.
• Diagnosis is by identiﬁcation of the mutated genes.

Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF)
Presentation
• Inherited disease, most common in Jews, Arabs, Italians, Turks, and
Armenians, especially those living around the Mediterranean basin.
• Clinical features include attacks of abdominal pain with high fever,
mimicking acute peritonitis but settling over 24-48 hours. Pleuritic
chest pain, arthritis (which may be destructive and mimic RhA), and
erythematous skin rashes also occur. Pericarditis may occur rarely.
• Attacks usually begin before the age of 20 (90% of cases).
• Typical attacks last 24-72 hours and can be triggered by physical
exertion, stress, and menstruation.
• Periodicity is variable and unpredictable.
• AA amyloid may be a long-term complication of repeated attacks,
especially in Jews.

TNF-RECEPTOR-ASSOCIATED PERIODIC SYNDROME

Cause and immunopathogenesis
• Inherited as an autosomal recessive.
• Associated with mutations in the MEFV gene (16p13.3), encoding pyrin
(also known as marenostrin), a protein that regulates caspase 1 and
IL-1 secretion.

Investigations
• There is a peripheral blood leucocytosis, mild anaemia, and the ESR
and CRP rise during attacks. Fibrinogen levels are high (>g/L).
• Serum immunoglobulins are non-speciﬁcally polyclonally elevated.
• Involved serosal surfaces have an inﬂammatory inﬁltrate, mainly
neutrophils. Joint ﬂuid also shows a high neutrophil count during an
acute attack.
• Autoantibodies are not found.
• Biopsies need to be considered if AA amyloid is suspected.
• Genetic diagnosis is conﬁrmatory.

Treatment
• Colchicine in a daily dose of 1-1.5mg will reduce the frequency
and severity of attacks markedly and reduce the risk of developing
amyloidosis.
• Colchicine taken inadvertently by pregnant women may increase the
risk of Down’s syndrome.
• 5-10% of cases are resistant to colchicine.
• Anakinra is beneﬁcial.

TNF-receptor-associated periodic
syndrome (TRAPS, familial
Hibernian fever)
Presentation
• Recurrent attacks of pleurisy, peritonitis, pericarditis, erythematous
rash, arthritis, and myalgia, beginning in childhood.
• Conjunctivitis, rarely uveitis.
• 15% develop amyloidosis.
• Attacks usually prolonged >7 days.

Cause and immunopathogenesis
• Dominant mutations in the TFRSF1A gene (12p13), encoding the TNF
receptor.
• Mutations occur in external domains and prevent the normal shedding
of the receptor.

343

344

CHAPTER 14

Miscellaneous conditions

Diagnosis
• Demonstration of TNF-R mutations.

Treatment
• Corticosteroids are better than colchicine.
• Anti-TNF agents (etanercept)—preferred treatment.
• Anakinra.

Hyper-IgD syndrome
Clinical features
• Rare autosomal recessive syndrome comprises bouts of fever,
lymphadenitis, and occasionally oligoarthritis. Diffuse rash.
• Peritonitis and pleurisy are common.
• Oral and vaginal ulcers may occur.
• Attacks last 3-7 days.
• Severe immunization reactions are a particular feature.

Cause and immunopathogenesis
• Mutations in the MVK gene (12q24) encoding mevalonate kinase.
• Predominantly occurs in Dutch and northern Europeans.
• 24% of cases do not have mutations in the coding part of the gene.

Investigations
• Humoral immune responses may be poor, with reduced IgM, raised
IgG3, and very high IgD levels. IgA may also be elevated.
• IgD can be measured with commercial RID assays.

Treatment
•
•
•
•

NSAIDs for fever.
Anakinra and anti-IL-1 treatments—preferred option.
Anti-TNFs may be tried.
Statins may have a role (mevalonate kinase is part of the HMG-CoA
reductase pathway).

Muckle-Wells and related syndromes
Three hereditary febrile syndromes have been described in association
with dominant mutations in the gene C1AS1, coding for cryopyrin.
• Muckle-Wells syndrome.
• Episodic symptoms lasting up to 48 hours. Urticaria (not associated
with cold), arthralgia, myalgia, headache, conjunctivitis, episcleritis.
May lead to amyloidosis (25%).
• Neonatal-onset multisystem inﬂammatory disease (NOMID), also
known as CINCA (chronic infantile neurological cutaneous and
articular syndrome).
• Chronic disease, diffuse urticaria, epiphyseal overgrowth,
conjunctivitis, uveitis (blindness), sensorineural deafness.
Amyloidosis may occur as late feature.

BLAU SYNDROME

• Familial cold autoinﬂammatory syndrome (FCAS).
• Fever, rigors, headache, arthralgia, conjunctivitis, and urticaria in
response to cold exposure.
• Familial cold urticaria is a milder variant of FCAS which also maps
to the C1AS1 gene.

Treatment
• NSAIDS are usually used.
• Anakinra (IL-1RA) and canakinumab (anti-IL1b) are very effective.
• Rilonacept (dimeric fusion protein with binding regions of the IL-1
receptor and the IL-1R accessory protein, fused to IgG1 Fc) appears to
be highly effective.
• The experimental caspase-1 inhibitor VX-765 has been shown to
reduce IL-1 and is undergoing trials.

Periodic fever with aphthous ulcers,
pharyngitis, and cervical adenopathy
(PFAPA)
• A rare syndrome characterized by periodic fever, aphthous ulceration,
pharyngitis, and adenitis.
• Starts early in childhood but improves as child grows up.
• Cause uncertain—no gene identiﬁed yet.
• Treat with corticosteroids, colchicines, or IL-1 inhibition.
• Adenotonsillectomy has resolved some cases.

Schnitzler’s syndrome
• A rare syndrome characterized by urticaria, skin papules, intermittent
fever, bone pain, arthritis/arthralgia, and monoclonal IgM monoclonal
gammopathy.
• Severe anaemia of chronic disease is common.
• IL-6 levels are elevated.
• Evolves into lymphoma or Waldenström’s macroglobulinaemia in 15%.
• Treatment may involve corticosteroids, colchicine, thalidomide, or
anakinra. Preferred treatment is anakinra.
• Anti-TNF therapy may make it worse.
• Anti-histamines rituximab and hdIVIg are ineffective.

Blau syndrome
• Familial granulomatous arthritis, iritis, cutaneous granulomata.
• Overlaps with sarcoidosis and Crohn’s disease.
• Associated with mutations in the NOD2 gene.

345

346

CHAPTER 14

Miscellaneous conditions

• Presents with early arthritis (destructive), pyoderma gangrenosum
(variable), and nodulocystic acne.
• Mutations identiﬁed in CD2 binding protein 1 gene (CD2BP1) located
on chromosome 15.
• Treat with anti-TNF or anti-IL-1 agents.

Xanthogranulomatosis
• Syndrome is characterized by subcutaneous xanthogranulomatous
plaques, typically around the eyes, associated with hard subcutaneous
nodules.
• There is an association with the development of paraproteins and
eventually with lymphomas.
• Paraproteins seem to associate with apo-B lipoproteins, which are
then taken up by macrophages in the lesions.
• Diagnosis is made by appearance and biopsy features.
• The disease responds well to corticosteroids.
• Regular monitoring of serum immunoglobulins and electrophoresis is
required.

Kikuchi’s syndrome
• A rare syndrome of lymphadenopathy seen in children and young
adults. It is usually self-limiting.
• Clinical features include fever, lymphadenopathy, skin rashes, and
headache.
• May be triggered by viral infections (CMV, EBV, HSV, VZV,
parvovirus).
• Possible association with autoimmune diseases, including SLE.
• May also be a cause of haemophagocytosis.
• Responds to NSAIDs; corticosteroids for severe disease.

CHEILITIS GRANULOMATOSA

Satoyoshi syndrome (Komura-Guerri
syndrome)
• A very rare syndrome of progressive muscle spasms, alopecia,
diarrhea, endocrinopathy with amenorrhoea, and skeletal
abnormalities, ﬁrst described in Japan.
• Spasms are painful and can affect breathing; myoclonus may occur.
There are similarities to stiff person syndrome.
• Thought to be autoimmune; may be associated with antibodies to
GAD.

Castleman’s syndrome
•
•
•
•
•

Syndrome of diffuse lymphadenopathy, fever, malaise, and weight loss.
Many cases appear to be due to HHV-8 infection.

Cheilitis granulomatosa (Miescher-
Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome,
orofacial granulomatosis)
• Rare syndrome presenting with non-tender swelling of the lips (upper
lip more common than lower lip).
• Initially attacks are intermittent, but eventually the swelling becomes
permanent and progressive.
• Must be distinguished from angioedema (more persistent).
• Attacks of swelling may be accompanied by low-grade fever.
• Swellings may also appear on other parts of the face.
• Lymph nodes may be enlarged.
• Tongue may be ﬁssured.
• Facial palsy may occur in one-third.
• Biopsies may show granulomata in established cases.
• May have a genetic basis but the cause is unknown; may be a localized
form of Crohn’s disease.
• 0Consider a labelled white cell scan to look for other evidence of
Crohn’s disease
• Patch testing may show positive reactions to cinnamon and benzoates,
and occasionally metals. Trial of dietary avoidance may help a few
patients.
• Treatments suggested include clofazimine, metronidazole, intra-lesional
steroid, azathioprine, sulfapyridine, dapsone and other antibiotics.

347

348

CHAPTER 14

Miscellaneous conditions

Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) 1
Chronic fatigue is a major presentation to doctors; causes are multiple and
establishing a diagnosis is time-consuming. CFS is a diagnosis of exclusion.
ME (myalgic encephalomyelitis) is an inappropriate term as there is no
evidence for an encephalomyelitis. It is not a new syndrome and has been
well described from Victorian times onwards (neurasthenia).

Presentation
• Signiﬁcant debilitating fatigue (not tiredness!) lasting beyond 6 months.
• About half have a sudden onset, often after an acute infectious event;
the remainder have gradual onset (unclear if these types differ).
• Excess of ‘major life events’ in the year preceding presentation.
• Other symptoms include:
• unrefreshing sleep, sleep disturbance
• poor short-term memory and poor concentration, word-ﬁnding
difﬁculty
• non-speciﬁc arthralgia, without arthritis
• myalgia
• headaches
• disturbed temperature perception
• sore throats and swollen glands
• debilitating fatigue
• secondary depression
• alcohol intolerance
• activity makes all symptoms worse.
• Weight loss is not a feature and should always prompt a detailed
search for an underlying medical or surgical cause.
• Patients often self-diagnose CFS/ME. This is dangerous.
• Patients may acquire bizarre beliefs about the cause and treatment
of their symptoms, obtained from alternative practitioners, lay
publications, and the internet. These include:
• multiple allergies, including multiple chemical sensitivity
• reactions to mercury amalgam ﬁllings
• chronic Candida overgrowth.
• There is no evidence to support these aetiologies.
• Chronic fatigue syndrome is a hotch-potch of miscellaneous
syndromes, dependent on the speciality of the ‘expert’! Included within
the spectrum are:
• irritable bowel syndrome
• food allergy
• ﬁbromyalgia (FM)
• somatization disorder
• effort syndrome
• over-training syndrome (see ‘Sports immunology 2’, p.358)
• patients with otherwise unexplained persistent fatigue and/or
atypical pain
• patients with signiﬁcant medical/psychiatric disorders (up to 47% of
referrals to hospital).

CHRONIC FATIGUE SYNDROME 1

Differential diagnosis
In hospital practice, up to 47% of patients may turn out to have other
medical or surgical problems. The differential diagnosis is long but includes
the following.
• Chronic infections: EBV, HIV, Coxsackievirus, Toxoplasma, Brucella,
Yersinia, Borrelia;
• Connective tissue diseases: SLE, Sjögren’s syndrome, rheumatoid
arthritis, polymyositis, and polymyalgia rheumatica often have a long
prodrome of fatigue;
• Other autoimmune diseases: especially thyroid disease, Addison’s
disease, diabetes mellitus, pituitary disease.
• Gastrointestinal disease: PBC, autoimmune hepatitis, coeliac disease.
• Neurological disease: MS, degenerative disease (including CJD),
Parkinson’s disease (early stages), primary muscle disease.
• Sleep apnoea, other primary sleep disorders including restless legs.
• Cardiac disease: cardiomyopathy (alcohol, thiamine deﬁciency).
• Poisoning: carbon monoxide, heavy metals, prescription drugs (e.g.
β-blockers, minor opiate analgesics).
• Malignancy.
• Primary psychiatric disorders: depression (but a secondary depression
is common), autistic spectrum disorders, somatization disorder, stress.
• Malingering: rare, but usually perpetuated by obvious ﬁnancial beneﬁt
from maintenance of sick role.

UK and US case deﬁnitions for CFS
The UK criteria have evolved out of the need to identify homogeneous
groups of patients for research trials. Not all patients will ﬁt the criteria.
• Severe disabling fatigue affecting physical and mental functioning.
• Minimum duration of symptoms—6 months.
• Functional impairment—disabling.
• Mental fatigue required.
• No other symptoms required.
• No evidence of other medical illness.
• Normal screening blood tests.
The North Americans have a similar but slightly different case deﬁnition.
• Physical causes of fatigue excluded.
• Psychiatric disorders excluded, including:
• psychosis
• bipolar disorder
• eating disorder
• organic brain disease.

Epidemiology
• Institutional epidemic outbreaks (Royal Free disease). These differ
substantially from sporadic disease.
• ‘Chronic fatigue’, loosely deﬁned, is very common in the community:
prevalence of 20-30%.
• 10-20% of attenders in primary care complain of chronic fatigue
(loosely deﬁned).

For 5-10% this will be the primary reason for consultation.
Only a minority fulﬁl the case deﬁnition for CFS (see above).
Female to male ratio 2:1.
The prevalence of CFS/ME is much lower, but similar ﬁgures have
been obtained from the USA and UK (using the different criteria):
• point prevalence, 0.08-1% range using restrictive criteria
• point prevalence of up to 2.6% using UK (Oxford) criteria
• there are no reliable data on incidence.
• It has been estimated that there may be as many as 150 000 cases in
the UK.

CFS 2: cause and immunopathogenesis,
assessment, and investigations
Cause and immunopathogenesis
Virology
• Antecedent history of acute viral infection can be documented in
about 50% CFS/ME patients.
• Deﬁnable fatigue syndromes are well documented after:
• Epstein-Barr virus—persistent EBV IgM positive (chronic EBV), only
occurs in 10% of EBV-infected individuals
• Toxoplasma
• cytomegalovirus
• other infectious agents (non-speciﬁc response)—severe bacterial
infections.
• Association with enteroviral infections is unproven (VP1 test is not
reliable).
• Association with XMRV (murine retrovirus) has been shown not be
true.
Immunology
• No evidence for a primary immunological cause. Identiﬁed
abnormalities may well be secondary.
• Abnormalities described are:
• minor abnormalities of IgG subclasses
• increased CD5+ CD19+ B cells
• poor B-cell function
• low levels of autoantibodies (RhF)
• reduced CD4+ T cells increased CD8+ T cells
• increased markers of T-cell activation
• abnormalities of NK cells and monocytes
• no clear changes in cytokine production
• antibodies against nuclear pore antigens were found in 60-70% of
CFS patients in one study.
0 Signiﬁcant immunological abnormalities should raise doubts about a
diagnosis of CFS.

CHRONIC FATIGUE SYNDROME 2

Genetic abnormalities
• Likely to be a genetic predispisition to develop the disease:
• other family members may be affected
• multiple genes involved (brain, immune system).
Muscle abnormalities
• No characteristic abnormalities:
• CK may be mildly elevated
• NMR studies demonstrate abnormal metabolism, with failure to
clear lactate
• Cardiomyopathy may occur in a small subset.
Neurological abnormalities
• No diagnostic abnormalities. However, a range of abnormalities has
been documented, the signiﬁcance of which is uncertain at present.
• MRI scanning may show white matter abnormalities.
• Single-photon emission tomography (SPET) reﬂects abnormalities of
regional cerebral perfusion.
• SPET abnormalities identiﬁed in brainstem; lesser abnormalities are
reported in patients with depression.
• Autonomic abnormalities are frequent and may occur in other
disorders with fatigue (PBC). Postural orthostatic tachycardia
syndrome (POTS) is a variant of CFS with marked autonomic
abnormalities. Severity of autonomic disorder correlates with fatigue.
Endocrine abnormalities
• Dynamic tests of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis demonstrate
abnormal responses.
• Subgroup of CFS patients may have low cortisols (usually high in
depression). Exclude Addison’s disease.
Psychiatric changes
• No convincing evidence to show that CFS is a purely psychiatric
disorder.
• Depression is usually secondary.
• There is an increased risk of developing psychiatric disorder in CFS
patients (2- to 7.5-fold compared with chronic disease controls).
• There is overlap with somatization disorders.

Assessment
• Assess the patient objectively (and try to ignore the long-standing
patient’s interpretation of events).
• Are criteria for CFS met?
• What is the degree of disability?
• What are the patient’s beliefs about his/her illness?
• Are there any symptoms/signs of other medical problems?
• Low-grade fever, muscle wasting, orthostatic hypotension, pallor,
breathlessness, tremor allowable (deconditioning due to prolonged
rest).
• Marked weight loss, lymphadenopathy, and fever >38°C require
further investigation and should not be accepted as part of CFS.

CHAPTER 14

Miscellaneous conditions

Investigations
• There are no speciﬁc diagnostic tests.
• Basic screen must include:
• FBC, differential white count
• acute-phase response (evidence for inﬂammatory disease—ESR/
CRP)
• LFTs, Cr&E, TFTs, blood sugar, CK
• endomysial/tissue tranglutaminase antibody (tTG) antibody
• urine (protein/sugar).
• Other tests should only be carried out if there are suspicious ﬁndings
on history or examination. These may include:
• viral serology (EBV, HIV)
• cortisol, short synacthen test
• screening for connective tissue disease.
0 There is no role for routine viral serology, lymphocyte subsets, or
autoantibody screens.

CFS 3: management, outcome, and
children with CFS
Management
• A holistic approach is required—‘mindfulness’ (Kabat-Zinn 2004).
• Evaluate the contribution of life events and psychological
background.
• Identify signiﬁcant secondary depression and deal with this.
• Deal with bizarre beliefs: www.quackwatch.com is a useful website
with robust rebuttals of bizarre beliefs; www.neurosymptoms.org/
is another useful sites for patients with non-organic neurological
symptoms.
• Reassurance early that no serious medical condition has been
identiﬁed.
• Detailed explanation of current theories of CFS.
• Expected prognosis.
• Limit investigation (and control multiple referrals!).
• Management by the smallest possible team.
• Physical reconditioning.
• Graded exercise and pacing.
• Sleep hygiene
• Drug therapy is symptomatic (not curative).
- Sodium valproate is well tolerated for pain.
- Amitriptyline in very small doses may help sleep and FM pain.
- Duloxetine is recommended for FM.
- Melatonin is useful for teenagers with CFS and sleep disturbance
(need to have a break every 4-6 weeks as effect wears off).
- Antidepressants for reactive depression: citalopram is better
tolerated than ﬂuoxetine/paroxetine.
• Psychological support.

CHRONIC FATIGUE SYNDROME 3

•

•
•
•

• Cognitive behaviour therapy (often resisted by patients).
• Lightning therapy, an accelerated form of psychotherapy based
on neurolinguistic programming (NLP) helps some patients
signiﬁcantly.
• General support from a sympathetic medical team.
• Fighting Fatigue (Pemberton and Berry 2009) is an excellent selfhelp guide for patients.
• A recent study from Norway has suggested a response to
rituximab—this ﬁnding needs replication in larger blinded trials.
0 There is NO place in management for:
• immunoglobulin (intravenous or intramuscular)
• antihistamines
• interferons (usually make the symptoms worse)
• antivirals (except where there is a proven persistent EBV infection)
• antifungals
• magnesium
• colonic irrigation
• anti-Candida diets
• low-allergen diets
• enzyme-potentiated desensitization.
Homeopathy, aromatherapy, reﬂexology, acupuncture may provide
symptomatic relief.
Multiple medical referrals perpetuate illness.
Deal with need for support for beneﬁts, occupational advice.

Outcome
• The prognosis is variable.
• Most patients show signiﬁcant improvement over 2 years if
identiﬁed early and entered into a management programme.
• ‘Cure’ rate is probably 6-13% (several different series).
• If there is no improvement by 2 years, recovery is unlikely
(assuming that no perpetuating features are identiﬁed).
• It is important to discuss adaptation of the patient’s lifestyle to his/her
illness early on.
• There are no laboratory markers that predict outcome.
• Progression of symptoms may mean that the original diagnosis is
wrong—be prepared to re-evaluate.
• 0Treat all new symptoms on their merits—just because a patient has
a diagnosis of CFS/ME doesn’t mean that they will not develop other
unrelated illnesses.
• A poor outcome is associated with:
• late presentation
• unaddressed psychosocial factors
• poor management (‘There is nothing wrong with you—it’s all in
your mind’)
• inadequate rehabilitation (failure to encourage exercise perpetuates
deconditioning)
• secondary gain
• perpetuation of bizarre beliefs (Candida syndrome, total allergy
syndrome).

Miscellaneous conditions

Children with CFS
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Syndrome is not as rare in children as previously thought!
Earlier assessment of a tired child is appropriate.
Beware of ‘Munchausen syndrome by proxy’.
Management is more complicated and must address family issues.
Depression is common (60-80% of childhood CFS cases).
The same principles as those identiﬁed above apply to investigation
and management.
Psychosocial factors (bullying) and psychiatric problems must be dealt
with.
Deal with peer-relationship problems and school avoidance.
Avoid home tuition, as this encourages social isolation.
Aim for a recovery programme including graded physical and
intellectual exercise, with identiﬁcation of recovery goals.

Idiopathic oedema
• A syndrome of non-menstrually related swelling of face, hands,
abdomen, and feet, with no identiﬁable causes.
• Associated with affective, somatic, and functional symptoms, including
debilitating fatigue.
• Overlaps with CFS/ME, ﬁbromyalgia and irritable bowel syndrome.
• May respond to spironolactone or bromocriptine (dopaminergic
mechanism?).

Macrophagic myofasciitis
• Rare muscle disease, said to be triggered by aluminium salts in vaccines
• Focal inﬁltration of vaccinated muscles with PAS+ macrophages.
• Associated with systemic features:
• Fatigue
• Malaise
• Generalised arthralgia and myalgia
• Muscle weakness
• Fever
• Muscle biopsy & MRI may show abnormalities
• No speciﬁc treatment - manage as for CFS/ME.

POSTURAL ORTHOSTATIC TACHYCARDIA SYNDROME (POTS)

Burning mouth syndrome
• Characterized by intraoral burning sensation without evidence of
medical or dental disease.
• Need to exclude xerostomia, aphthous ulceration, vitamin
deﬁciencies, intra-oral infections including HSV.
• Patch testing, particularly to nickel, amalgam components, and
dental products (cinnamon, benzoates), may identify delayed
hypersensitivity in a small number of patients.
• It is one of a family of medically unexplained facial pain syndromes,
which may have psychological elements.
• May present as ‘oral allergy’—testing to prove to the patient that
allergy is NOT the cause may be required.
• 0Allergy does not cause continuous burning pain.
• Treat with tricyclic antidepressants, gabapentin, clonazepam, or
possibly pramipexole (non-ergot dopamine D2 receptor agonist,
unlicensed indication).

Postural orthostatic tachycardia
syndrome (POTS)
• Condition seen predominantly in young women, often but not
exclusively with CFS/ME. May be associated with vasovagal syncope.
• Clinical features include postural dizziness, excessive thirst, and
palpitations, as well as other CFS/ME symptoms.
• Key clinical ﬁnding is inappropriate tachycardia on asking the patient to
stand after resting horizontally. Pulse should rise to >120bpm.
• Diagnosis requires formal tilt-table testing.
• 0It is important to recognize this syndrome as it is amenable to
treatment (and in the context of CFS this reduces overall fatigue).
Treatment includes:
• increase ﬂuid and salt intake
• avoid alcohol
• ﬂudrocortisone
• midodrine
• β-blockers (not well tolerated in CFS/ME)
• ivabridine (experimental)

356

CHAPTER 14

Miscellaneous conditions

Sports immunology 1
• The immunology of sport is interesting because of the increased
susceptibility to infection that high-level sporting activity generates.
• Changes may be due to acute effects of training/competition and
longer-term adaptive changes.
• Changes may be secondary to neurohumoral changes.
• Chronic change is usually related to hard training (see ‘Sports
immunology 2: over-training syndrome’, p.358).
• Use of illicit drugs should be considered, as these may affect immune
function.

Acute-phase response
• Exercise increases acute-phase proteins (CRP, ﬁbrinogen, haptoglobin),
although considerable amounts of exercise (>2 hours) are required.
• Levels of IL-1 (although this is contentious), IL-6, A- and G-interferon,
and TNFA in serum are increased (with caveats about serum
measurements of cytokines).
• LPS-stimulated release of cytokines by monocytes is also increased by
adrenaline, which is present in high levels during exercise.
• IL-2 levels are reduced.

Innate immune response
• C3a increases signiﬁcantly following exercise—the greater the duration
of exercise, the greater the rise.
• Damage to muscle ﬁbres may be the trigger for alternate pathway
activation.
• After quite short bursts of exercise, a leucocytosis is present because
of increased mobilization.
• After marathons, a persistent marked neutrophil and monocyte
leucocytosis is apparent.
• Adrenaline may play a role in the mobilization, although it may still
occur in the presence of B-blockade.
• Neutrophils are also activated, and granule components may be
detected in the circulation.
• NK-cell numbers are increased in absolute and percentage terms, and
NK activity is increased, except in high-intensity exercise (such as a
marathon) when it is reduced.

Speciﬁc immunity
• Many effects on the speciﬁc immune system have been described,
although the relationship to clinical status is often obscure.
• The following changes have been documented in B cells during and
immediately after acute exercise:
• no signiﬁcant change in B-cell numbers
• reduced salivary IgA after long-duration exercise
• reduction of circulating antibody-producing cells
• monocyte-induced suppression (indomethacin inhibitable,
suggesting role for prostaglandins).

SPORTS IMMUNOLOGY 1

• The following changes have been documented in T cells during and
immediately after acute exercise:
• increase in T cells (CD8+ > CD4+)
• altered CD4:CD8 ratio
• increased CD4+ CD45RO+ T cells (?activation or altered trafﬁcking)
• reduced proliferative response to PHA and ConA
• increased proliferative responses to IL-2, LPS, PWM
• increased soluble activation markers after long-duration exercise
(sIL-2R, sCD8, sICAM-1, sCD23, sTNF-R, neopterin).
• Many of the effects on the immune system are mediated by the
combination of changes in circulating and local hormones:
• catecholamines
• growth hormone
• endorphins
• cortisol (which may be responsible for late effects).
• Hypoxia and hyperthermia may also contribute.
• Glutamine reduction due to increased muscle demand for glutamine as
an energy source starves the immune system of an essential metabolic
precursor, leading to impaired function.

Adaptive changes during training
• Resting immunology of athletes during training does not normally
show very dramatic changes.
• During low-intensity training there is a decrease in total lymphocyte
count, with a reduction of the CD4:CD8 ratio.
• More intense training tends to have less effect.
• NK-cell numbers increase slightly.
• Most trained athletes show slightly higher neutrophil counts, although
some long-distance runners may have a neutropenia.
• Neutrophil (and monocyte) function is normal.
• Acute changes in immunological parameters seen in trained athletes
are less than in sedentary individuals undertaking a similar workload.

Exercise and infection
• The acute changes noted above may give a window of opportunity to
pathogens, accounting for increased susceptibility to infection postexercise.
• The window may last up to 2 weeks.
• Risks seem to be mainly in long-distance (marathon) runners.

357

358

CHAPTER 14

Miscellaneous conditions

Sports immunology 2: over-training
syndrome
• There is a J-shaped curve relating overall immune function to exercise.
Low and moderate levels of exercise improve immunological function;
high levels lead to immunological impairment.
• It is difﬁcult to ascertain for any given individual what level of exercise
will be compromising immune function.
• Over-training syndrome has many features in common with chronic
fatigue syndrome (see pp.348-54).
• Short-term fatigue is a normal consequence of exercise.
• Prolonged fatigue is usually a marker of over-training.
• This can usually be attributed to inappropriate training and/or
competitive programmes that do not allow adequate recovery periods.
• The nature of the over-training syndrome is uncertain, but might
relate to chronic overproduction of acute-phase cytokines (e.g. TNF)
and hormones (cortisol and thyroid hormones are increased while
testosterone is decreased).
• Interference with the neurohumoral axis may occur, and patients may
have features of anxiety and depression.
• Chronic glutamine deﬁciency may be a minor contributing factor.
• Illicit drugs and inappropriate supplements may contribute (seek
information by direct questioning).
0High-intensity exercise may be a surrogate form of anorexia in young
females in particular. Such athletes are at high risk of serious complication
of exercise due to inadequate nutrition and over-exercising: stress fractures, premature osteoporosis, and iron-deﬁciency anaemia.

Immunology
• Immunological changes of optimum training are difﬁcult to analyse, but
include:
• increased NK-cell numbers and activity
• minor changes in T- and B-cell numbers
• little change in serum immunoglobulins
• increased levels of soluble markers such as IL-2R, sCD8, sICAM-1,
sCD23, and sTNF-R.
• Very heavy training and/or competition tend to lead to a reduction in
cell numbers and function and reductions in antibody levels.
• Exercise itself tends to mobilize cells from storage pools (spleen,
marginated cells) but this effect is transient.
• In the over-training syndrome:
• lymphocyte and NK-cell numbers are reduced
• there is evidence of in vivo activation on the basis of expression of
activation markers CD25, CD69, and HLA-DR (on T cells)
• in vitro mitogen responses are reduced (a common ﬁnding where
there is evidence of increased in vivo activation)
• phagocytic cell function is impaired.

DEPRESSION AND IMMUNE FUNCTION

Investigation
• Similar to that for chronic fatigue (see ‘CFS 2’, p.350-1).
• Investigation should be geared towards excluding other contributors
to fatigue:
• full blood count including differential white count
• acute phase (ESR/CRP)
• glucose and thyroid and liver function test;
• serological tests for chronic infection (EBV, Toxoplasma)
• vitamin and mineral status (iron, especially in women, folate, B12)
• serum immunoglobulins and lymphocyte surface markers if there is
a history of signiﬁcant infections.
• Routine diagnostic use of lymphocyte subset analysis and in vitro tests
of NK- and T-cell function are not normally required for management.

Treatment
• Explain the cause of the problem.
• Advise a period of reduction of training to base levels for a period of
several months, followed by a gradual increase.
• Emphasizing the need to have peaks and recovery troughs in the
training programme is essential.
• Attention to diet and vitamin and mineral supplementation may be
required.
• There is no good scientiﬁc evidence that high-dose vitamin C helps,
but many sports people have empirically found that it reduces their
susceptibility to infection. However, it may cause renal stones as it is
metabolized to oxalate. This may be a particular problem in athletes
who are prone to dehydration during competition, so it is important
to emphasize the need for adequate hydration.
• Refer to a sports medicine specialist (English Institute of Sport can
advise: http://www.eis2win.co.uk/pages/Sport_Medicine.aspx).

Depression and immune function
• There is a close link between mental state and immune function.
• Lymphocytes have receptors for certain neurotransmitters
(catecholamines) as well as neurohormones (endorphins).
• Cytokines such as IL-1 affect cerebral function (fever, hormone release).
• Chronic or severe acute stress may be both immunosuppressive and
lead to an increased risk of infection, through multiple neurohumoral
pathways.
• Similar changes are seen in prolonged depressive illness.
• Findings may include:
• minor lymphopenia and reduced NK cells
• poor NK function
• reduced immunization responses.
• Routine investigation of the immune system is not warranted unless
there is evidence of a major susceptibility to bacterial or viral infection.
• Recognition and treatment of underlying cause is essential.

359

360

CHAPTER 14

Miscellaneous conditions

Immunology of infection
Dealing with infection is the primary function of the immune system and
the reader is referred to the standard immunology textbooks for details
of this. However, there are certain clinically important points that need to
be borne in mind when interpreting immunological tests taken in patients
with active infection.

Neutrophils
• A neutrophilia, often with a left shift (i.e. immature cells newly
emigrating from the marrow) and toxic granulation, is a major early
feature of bacterial infection.
• Severe neutropenia may also result from overwhelming sepsis due to
consumption exceeding the marrow capacity for production.
• This must be distinguished from a primary neutropenia causing the
infection. Bone marrow examination may help.
• If severe, G-CSF may speed recovery.

Monocytes
• Monocytosis is often seen in viral infections.
• Compensatory monocytosis is also seen during infective episodes in
neutropenic patients.

Eosinophils
• Marked eosinophilia is a feature of parasitic infections.
• In the UK marked eosinophilia with fever is more likely to be due to
a hyper-eosinophilic syndrome with or without vasculitis than to an
infection.
• Eosinophilia >10×109/L will be due to hyper-eosinophilic syndromes,
not parasites.
• Hodgkin’s lymphoma may cause eosinophilia (and fever).
• Levels of eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) may be signiﬁcantly raised
and are important in diseases like Churg-Strauss vasculitis, as high
levels of ECP are neurotoxic.

Lymphocytes
• Acute viral and bacterial infections often lead to a generalized
proportional lymphopenia.
• In viral infections this will be followed by a rise in the CD8+ cytotoxic
T cells and a fall in CD4+ T cells, leading to a marked reversal of the
CD4:CD8 ratio.
• There is usually an increase in activation markers (CD25, HLA-DR).
• For this reason, lymphocyte subset analysis is not suitable as surrogate
testing for HIV.
• EBV infection often leads to a marked lymphocytosis, with B cells
followed by CD8+ T cells.
• Very high B-cell counts may occur following EBV infection in bone
marrow transplant patients where there are insufﬁcient T cells to
control the EBV-driven B-cell proliferation (B-lymphoproliferative
disease).

IMMUNOLOGY OF INFECTION

Serum immunoglobulins
• Acute bacterial infection may lead to severe
panhypogammaglobulinaemia. This may lead to erroneous diagnosis of
a primary antibody deﬁciency.
• Repeat testing after infection has been treated.
• 0 Do not start IVIg until conﬁrmatory tests have been carried out.
• More commonly, there will be an initial rise in IgM followed by a
polyclonal rise in IgG, which then returns to normal.
• Chronic infection will lead to signiﬁcant polyclonal increases in
immunoglobulins and may be accompanied by the appearance of
monoclonal bands in the serum (from anti-pathogen clones).
• Bands are often multiple on a polyclonally increased background.
• Excess free light chains may also be found in the urine.
• Bands will disappear within a few months of satisfactory treatment.
• Persistently raised IgM or IgA may be found in tuberculosis.

Complement
• Viral infection tends to have little effect on complement.
• Acute bacterial infection will often lead to reductions of C3 and C4 (as
well as factor B if measured).
• As complement components are acute-phase proteins, there may be
normal levels despite signiﬁcant consumption.
• Complement breakdown products will be increased.
• Haemolytic complement assays may show reduced activity related to
critical reductions in one or more components (usually in the terminal
lytic sequence).
• Patients with bacterial endocarditis often show marked reductions of
C3 and C4.
• In patients with suspected post-streptococcal nephritis, persistence of
a low C3 beyond 6 weeks should prompt a check for a C3-nephritic
factor, an autoantibody which stabilizes the alternative pathway
C3-convertase and leads to unregulated C3 cleavage.
• In patients with meningococcal disease, assay of haemolytic
complement to look for complement deﬁciency should be deferred
for at least 4 weeks. Doing the tests early often leads to confusing
results.

CRP
• Highest levels of CRP (>300mg/L) are seen in bacterial infection.
• Very highest levels (>400mg/L) are seen in Legionella infection.
• Beware of elevated CRP in infection with herpesviruses, especially EBV
(levels up to 100mg/L).
• High levels may also be seen in certain malignancies, including
lymphoma and hypernephroma (may present as PUO).

CHAPTER 14

Miscellaneous conditions

Immunological diseases of pregnancy 1
Pregnancy is a form of allograft and non-rejection is a complex multifactorial process. Readers are referred to major texts for detailed discussion.
• Immunological changes can be documented during pregnancy:
• reduction in T cells (mainly CD4+), which reaches a nadir around
the seventh month
• reduced NK-cell numbers
• B-cell numbers and function remain static
• antibody synthesis and serum immunoglobulin levels are essentially
unchanged.
• Despite the change from Th1 to Th2, there is no evidence for
increased susceptibility to infection, with the exception of Listeria,
which has a tropism for the placenta and requires macrophages and T
cells for clearance (these are locally suppressed).
• There are no changes in solid organ allograft tolerance during
pregnancy.
• Autoimmune diseases may behave unpredictably.
• Lupus may become worse or better during pregnancy, but may relapse
immediately after delivery because of the sudden hormonal changes.
• Vaccine responses are normal.

Pre-eclampsia
• See p.362.

Recurrent miscarriages
There are many immunological theories for recurrent miscarriages, but
most have little in the way of supportive evidence.
• Antibody-mediated theory.
• Anti-phospholipid antibodies: well substantiated.
• Anti-sperm antibodies: not substantiated.
• Anti-trophoblast antibodies: not substantiated.
• Blocking antibody deﬁciency (anti-paternal antibodies): these
antibodies are well documented but appear to be irrelevant to
pregnancy outcome (agammaglobulinaemic women and mice have
normal pregnancies).
• Absence of complement regulatory proteins CD55 and CD59 on
trophoblast as a cause of recurrent miscarriage: no evidence so far.
• Cell-mediated theory.
• Excessive Th1 response: some evidence of increased Th1 cytokines
(G-IFN and TNF-A, both of which are abortifacient in mice) and
Th1 responses to trophoblast antigens in recurrent aborters—this
is a strong possibility.
• Deﬁciency of Th2 cells/cytokines: no human evidence yet.
• Deﬁciency of decidual ‘suppressor’ cells: uncertain whether this is
cause or effect.
• Inappropriate MHC class I and II expression: evidence in mice only;
none from humans.
• HLA homozygosity: no convincing evidence as inbred mouse strains
reproduce normally.

IMMUNOLOGICAL DISEASES OF PREGNANCY 1

Laboratory investigation
• Screen for anti-phospholipid antibodies (cause microthrombi in
placenta with placental failure):
• anti-cardiolipin IgG and IgM antibodies—IgM anti-cardiolipin
antibodies are signiﬁcant if persistent
• anti-β2 glycoprotein-1 antibodies (if available)
• lupus anticoagulant: prolonged APTT—check dRVVT.
• Platelet count (APS patients have moderate thrombocytopenia,
80-120×109/L).
• Anti-thyroid peroxidase (microsomal) antibodies, anti-nuclear
antibodies, antibodies to ENA (especially Ro and La).
• C3 and C4.
These tests should identify otherwise ‘silent’ cases of SLE.
Management
• Joint obstetric and medical management is required for such patients.
• Low-dose aspirin or heparin may be required.
• Treat anti-phospholipid syndrome (APS) patients with no previous
history of thrombosis or pregnancy loss with low-dose aspirin alone.
• Those with a prior history of thrombosis should go on to heparin.
• Those with recurrent miscarriages and a previous history of
thrombosis should go on to aspirin plus heparin.
• Heparin is associated with occasional severe osteoporosis in
pregnancy. It is not yet clear whether this effect is also seen with low
molecular weight heparins.
• Discuss the risks of these therapies fully with the patient.
• If these treatments are unsuccessful, consider high-dose IVIg as an
immunoregulatory agent. Counsel concerning potential infective risks
(hepatitis, spongiform encephalopathies) and record information given
in the notes.
• The optimal treatment for recurrent miscarriages not associated with
anti-phospholipid antibodies is unknown.
• Many manipulations have been tried but there are few good clinical
trials. In 58% of untreated patients successful pregnancy may ensue,
and this ﬁgure rises to 85% with good supportive psychotherapy.
• No convincing evidence that leucocyte transfusions, steroids,
ciclosporin, progesterone (immunosuppressive in high doses), or
other drugs make a signiﬁcant difference.

Blood group incompatibility
See Chapter 9, ‘Autoimmune haemolytic anaemia’, p.233.

CHAPTER 14

Miscellaneous conditions

Immunological diseases of pregnancy
2: autoimmune diseases and
immunodeﬁciency
Autoimmune diseases
• Autoimmune diseases in the pregnant mother that are accompanied
by IgG autoantibodies may occur in the fetus/neonate due to placental
transmission of the antibody:
• myasthenia gravis
• thyroid disease.
• This also conﬁrms the pathogenicity of some antibodies.
• Mothers with SLE who are anti-Ro or anti-La antibody positive are at
increased risk of having babies affected with:
• neonatal lupus: photosensitive rash (made worse if the baby is given
phototherapy for jaundice)—self-limiting and disappears over ﬁrst 6
months as maternal IgG is catabolized;
• development of in utero complete heart block (Ro+ = 2%;
Ro+/La+ = 5%).
• Congenital complete heart block is caused by anti-Ro antibodies
crossing the placenta between 8 and 12 weeks gestation and causing
inﬂammation and subsequent ﬁbrosis of fetal cardiac conduction
system.
• Death may occur in utero.
• Survivors require immediate pacemaker insertion at birth (and
require lifelong pacemakers).
• Dexamethasone given during pregnancy crosses the placenta and
may reduce inﬂammation. It must be given early to be effective.
Prednisolone is metabolized by the placenta and is ineffective.
• 1 in 20 Ro+ mothers will be affected; if there has been an affected
pregnancy, risk rises to 1 in 4.
• Anti-La may also be associated with congenital complete heart
block.
• Children with neonatal lupus or congenital complete heart block are at
increased risk of developing lupus in their own right.

Immunodeﬁciency
• Primary antibody deﬁciency may be diagnosed during pregnancy when
routine testing fails to identify isohaemagglutinins in the pregnant
mother.
• Replacement therapy should be started at once to ensure
approximately normal levels of placental transfer.
• Failure to treat means that the neonate will be at signiﬁcant infective
risk during the ﬁrst 6-9 months of life.
• If no maternal replacement has been undertaken, the infant should
be given at least 6 months of IVIg in normal replacement doses, while
continuing to receive the normal childhood immunizations.

REFERENCES

• Maternal infection (including rubella and the herpesviruses; see
Chapter 2) during pregnancy, particularly peripartum, may also lead to
neonatal immunodeﬁciency due to in utero or neonatal infection.
• HIV infection poses particular risks of vertical transmission.
• Schedules of prophylactic treatment with antiretroviral drugs are now
used to reduce the risk of transmission.
• Congenital HIV infection may cause hypogammaglobulinaemia and
unsuspected cases may present with recurrent bacterial infections
rather than the opportunist infections seen in adults.

Pre-eclampsia and HELLP (haemolysis,
elevated liver enzymes, low platelets)
syndrome
• A syndrome of late pregnancy (5-7%) with severe hypertension and
peripheral oedema, which if untreated causes ﬁts and multi-organ
failure.
• Cause is unknown, but excessive IL-6 release and a placental tyrosine
kinase may contribute to maternal endothelial activation.
• Risk factors include:
• anti-phospholipid antibody syndrome
• nulliparous women
• presence of anti-thyroid antibodies
• extremes of maternal age
• diabetes
• pre-existing hypertension and/or renal disease.
• Complement C4 is reduced.
• HELLP syndrome is a form of severe pre-eclampsia with haemolysis,
elevated liver enzymes, low platelets.
• Urgent control of hypertension and rapid delivery are required for
control of the syndrome.

CHAPTER 15

Transplantation

Stem cell transplantation (HSCT) 1:
clinical indications and types of HSCT
Clinical indications
• Severe combined immunodeﬁciency (SCID): all types (see Chapter 1).
• Combined immunodeﬁciency where there is reason to suspect
progression, including:
• Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome
• hyper-IgM syndrome
• activation defects (ZAP70 kinase deﬁciency, etc.)
• MHC antigen deﬁciency (class I, class II)
• X-linked lymphoproliferative disease
• purine nucleoside phosphorylase deﬁciency
• cartilage-hair hypoplasia
• DiGeorge syndrome (severe thymic transplants also used)
• chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis
• CD40 ligand deﬁciency.
• Neutrophil disorders:
• chronic granulomatous disease
• leucocyte adhesion molecule deﬁciency (LFA-1 deﬁciency)
• Chediak-Higashi syndrome (in accelerated phase)
• Griscelli syndrome
• Schwachmann-Diamond syndrome.
• Inherited metabolic diseases:
• osteopetrosis
• Gaucher’s disease
• adrenoleucodystrophy
• metachromatic leucodystrophy
• mucopolysaccharidoses (Hurler’s syndrome, Maroteaux-Lamy
syndrome, Hunter syndrome)
• Lesch-Nyan syndrome.
• Marrow failure:
• Fanconi anaemia
• aplastic anaemia
• thalassaemia major
• congenital anaemia (Diamond-Blackfan syndrome).
• Lymphoma, leukaemias, myeloma, usually when in remission.
• Solid tumours (Ewing sarcoma, neuroblastoma, germ cell tumours,
breast and ovarian cancer).
• Juvenile chronic arthritis.

Types of HSCT
HSCT involves the reconstitution of the full haematopoietic system by
transfer of pluripotent stem cells. This may be as unpuriﬁed bone marrow
or manipulated to enrich stem cells.
• It can be classiﬁed according to donor source and site of harvest of
stem cells.
• Allogeneic—another genotypically matched individual acts as donor
of stem cells. May be a sibling or matched unrelated donor (MUD).

HSCT 2: CONDITIONING AND MATCHING

• Autologous—patient acts as own source for stem cells.
• Bone marrow stem cells procured from direct puncture and
aspiration of bone marrow before intravenous re-infusion.
• Peripheral stem cells—stem cells liberated into peripheral
circulation and then collected by apheresis.
• Cord blood stem cells—stem cells collected from umbilical cord
blood after delivery. These may come from cord blood stem cell
banks.
All sources of bone marrow/stem cells may undergo in vitro manipulation to remove mature T cells (T-cell depletion) or accomplish stem cell
(CD34+) enrichment.
• T-cell depletion can be achieved by:
• soya bean lectin and sheep erythrocyte agglutination
• Campath® antibody plus complement
• sheep erythrocyte agglutination.
• T-cell depletion and CD34+ stem cell enrichment may also be achieved
by magnetic bead separation.
• Type of manipulation may depend on underlying condition.
• Stem cells sourced from peripheral blood have 10-fold more mature T
cells than stem cells isolated from bone marrow.

HSCT 2: conditioning and matching
Conditioning
• Conditioning is required to eliminate residual immune system and
allow incoming stem cells to engraft.
• Recipient is treated with cytoreductive therapy including busulfan and
cyclophosphamide.
• This leads to a severe aplastic phase during which isolation to laminar
ﬂow isolation and supportive transfusion are required.
• Complications of this phase include:
• veno-occlusive disease
• alopecia
• severe mucositis
• immune suppression predisposing to wide variety of potentially
fatal infections.
• Prophylactic IVIg, antibiotics, antifungals, and antivirals are used
routinely.
• Regular surveillance and prompt treatment of infection is mandatory.
• Long-term complications include:
• infertility
• hypothyroidism
• secondary malignancy
• late sepsis due to hyposplenism
• psychological disturbance.
• Reduced intensity or non-myeloablative conditioning regimes may
be used in patients unable to tolerate the more toxic myeloablative
chemotherapy.

369

370

CHAPTER 15

Transplantation

• For many patients with SCID, donor stem cells may engraft without
conditioning due to lack of recipient T-cell numbers and function
normally required to reject a stem cell graft.

Matching
MHC matching is required for all allogeneic transplants.
• Success of the transplant is dependent on the match. Preferred
sources are ranked in the following order:
• (1) identical sibling matches
• (2) matched unrelated donors
• (3) if neither are available, haplo-identical parental bone marrow
or bone marrow from less well-matched unrelated donors can be
used.
• Where a SCID baby requires a haplo-identical marrow, paternal
marrow is preferred to eliminate any residual maternofetal
engraftment.
• Fully matched whole marrow can be used from an identical.
• Where there are mismatches, in vitro or in vivo T-cell depletion is used
to remove mature T cells that are capable of producing GvHD.
Matching procedures (see Chapter 21)
Conﬁrmation of the suitability of the chosen donor is checked pre-transplant by molecular typing.
• Mixed lymphocyte reactions (MLR) and CTLp or HTLp frequency
(Chapter 21) have been used in the past but are not commonly used
now.
• High levels of reactivity in these tests are good predictors of the
development of GvHD.
• Immunosuppressants, including ciclosporin, methotrexate,
mycophenolate mofetil, and steroids, are administered to reduce the
risks of development of GvHD.
Marrow donation
• Donors are assessed medically and screened for transmissible
infections, including EBV, HIV, CMV, and parvovirus.
• If there is a mismatch of viral status between donor and recipient,
prophylactic antivirals may be used.
• Whole marrow donors have to undergo a general anaesthetic for
harvest, so cardiorespiratory ﬁtness is essential.
• Marrow is now tested routinely for stem cell numbers to assess the
quality of the graft.
Stem cell harvesting
• Peripheral stem cell harvesting is also being used for patients with
marrow that would be unsuitable for harvesting (i.e. inﬁltrated with
tumour).
• In the autologous setting the advantages are:
• better stem cell yield;
• less contamination with tumour cells.

HSCT 3: POST-TRANSPLANT MONITORING

• In the allogeneic setting the advantages are:
• easier to collect from the donor’s perspective;
• faster engraftment.
• This can be augmented by administration of colony-stimulating factors
(CSFs) to donor prior to apheresis.
• Donors of the bone marrow may also be used as apheresis donors for
neutrophils to provide cover due to the aplastic phase post-transplant.
Procedural considerations
• Use of growth factors (G-CSF, GM-CSF) post-BMT in the recipient
may speed up the reconstitution process and shorten the aplastic
phase in the recipient.
• There are concerns about long-term leukaemic risk from use of
CSFs.
• All recipients must receive irradiated cellular blood products to
prevent accidental engraftment of viable donor lymphocytes until
there is evidence of satisfactory immunological recovery.
• All blood products should be CMV negative unless the recipient is
known to be CMV positive.

HSCT 3: post-transplant monitoring
Post-transplant immunological monitoring has an important role in optimizing management and, in particular, for assessing the return of adaptive
immunity. Frequency of monitoring depends on clinical status. Monitoring
should include the following.

Full blood count
• Indicates need for red cell and platelet support.
• Rise of the neutrophil count gives a good indication of when adequate
protective innate immunity has returned.
• Neutropenia post-BMT may last between 9 and 21 days.
• Neutropenia beyond 21 days suggests that stem cells have failed to
engraft.

Lymphocyte subsets
• Demonstrate when safe levels of CD4+ T and B cells have returned.
• Rising NK counts often precede infection and GvHD.
• Very rapid rises in B cells in the absence of T cells usually indicate
B-lymphoproliferative disease secondary to EBV.
• These should be done at least monthly, or more often if there are
problems.
• A basic panel will include CD4, CD8, CD3, CD16/56, CD25, HLA-DR,
CD19, or CD20.
• Other markers in combination (CD45RA, CD45RO, CD27) may be
helpful in monitoring immune reconstitution in greater depth.

371

372

CHAPTER 15

Transplantation

Acute-phase proteins (CRP)
• Provide early warning of infection.
• Regular monitoring is required.

Immunoglobulins
• Trough immunoglobulins to assess adequacy of IVIg replacement
(patients may be hypercatabolic and require increased doses) where
IVIg is being used.

Lymphocyte proliferation assays
• Optimum panel of mitogens should include PHA, anti-CD3 (OKT3),
and ConA.
• PHA responses are the last to return.
• ConA responses return earlier, followed by anti-CD3 responses.
• Flow cytometric assays involving CD69 expression do not correlate
well with formal proliferation assays.
• Assays should only be requested when T cells can be detected in the
peripheral blood.

Chimerism studies
• Genetic techniques (RFLP, FISH, karyotype) now allow analysis of the
origin of separated cell lineages (using monoclonal antibody coupled to
magnetic beads).
• In suitable patient-donor pairs, use of ﬂuorescent anti-MHC antibodies
may provide rapid information on the origin of cells (host or donor).
• B-cell recovery is often host even when T cells are donor.
• Despite this, there is usually full immunological recovery of B-cell
function even if there is an MHC mismatch between T and B cells.

Other functional tests
• The use of speciﬁc tests may determine the return of function
known to be defective pre-transplant and conﬁrm the success of the
transplant, e.g.:
• ﬂow cytometric analysis of oxidative metabolism of neutrophils
in CGD transplants where autologous reconstitution may be a
concern
• CD40L expression in transplants for hyper-IgM syndrome.
0 This assay is inhibited by prophylactic ciclosporin!
• Once prophylactic IVIg has been stopped, the development of IgG
subclasses and speciﬁc antibodies can be followed.
• Formal humoral responses to immunization can be evaluated.
• Clues to satisfactory B-cell function include the return of IgM
isohaemagglutinins and rising IgA and IgM levels, as well as satisfactory
B-cell numbers, in peripheral blood.

HSCT 4: IMMUNOLOGICAL RECONSTITUTION

HSCT 4: immunological reconstitution
• Rate of immunological development depends on:
• conditioning regime
• stem cell dose
• donor source
• use of and type of T-cell depletion
• matching of MHC
• development of GvHD
• use of immunomodulation post-transplant
• infection—both pre-existing, which may lead to a furious response
from the incoming graft, and infection acquired post-BMT.
• Under optimum conditions, evidence of lymphocyte engraftment is
usually present within 28 days, but may be delayed up to 90 days.
• Long-term monitoring of humoral immune function and cellular
reconstitution is required, as the very-long-term outlook is as yet
unknown.

T cells
• CD3+ T cells are absent in the ﬁrst month post-transplant and then
gradually rise to normal by 3 months in an uncomplicated transplant.
• Early post-transplant period is characterized by rapid expansion of
post-thymic derived T-cells leading to uneven clonal expansion and
skewed Tcr V gene expression.
• Reduced CD4+ T-cell numbers may persist for a year or more.
• CD8+ T cells reconstitute rapidly resulting in a reversed CD4/CD8 ratio.
• Thymic-derived ‘naive’ CD4+CD45RA+RO- T cells are required for
restoration of T-cell repertoire and start to appear after 6 months.
• Presence of T-cell receptor excision circles (TRECs) identify recent
thymic emigrants.
• Complete regeneration takes up to 2 years and in some cases never
fully recovers, with immune competence partly derived from the postthymic T-cell compartment.
• T-cell function returns sequentially, with anti-CD3/IL-2 responses
returning early and PHA responses occurring late (90-120 days).
• T-cell proliferation may be suboptimal for up to a year post-transplant.
• Drugs used for GvHD prophylaxis may affect T-cell proliferation assays.

B cells
• CD19+ (CD20+) B cells increase only slowly over the ﬁrst 3 months
post-transplant.
• Thereafter numbers increase to a plateau at 6-9 months.
• Early appearance of large numbers of B cells indicates either
• autologous reconstitution or
• EBV-driven lymphoproliferative disease.
• During the ﬁrst year post-engraftment, the majority of circulating B
cells express an undifferentiated phenotype.
• Return of class-switch memory B cells (IgM-IgD-CD27+) is slow.
• Recovery of normal B-cell numbers and function will take at least 2
years.

373

374

CHAPTER 15

Transplantation

• Post-transplant Ig gene rearrangements are polyclonal and normalize at
around 3 months.
• Gene rearrangements exhibit many fewer somatic mutations than
normal.
• There is differential recovery of Ig isotypes:
• IgM normalizes by 6 months
• IgG normalizes by 12 months
• IgA normalizes by 2 years.
• IgG2 subclass levels rise only very slowly after transplantation,
mirroring normal ontogeny.
• Return of isohaemagglutinins and a rising IgA and IgM are early signs
that can be readily detected despite IVIg.
• IVIg is usually continued for at least a year (longer if there have been
complications such as GvHD) and then stopped if there is evidence of
Ig production.
• Occasionally B cells fail to engraft and autologous B-cell reconstitution
does not take place. Such patients need to remain on IVIg.

NK cells
• Massive expansion occurs within a few weeks with NK activity reaching
normal within 1 month.

Poor outcome
• Some patients may have long-term evidence of immunodeﬁciency
with recurrent bacterial infections, low serum immunoglobulins, poor
speciﬁc antibacterial responses, and lymphopenia.
• These patients require long-term monitoring and prophylaxis, including
IVIg.

HSCT 5: immunization post-transplant
and results
Immunization post-transplant
• Current recommendations for post-HSCT vaccination schedules are
based on good theoretical but limited study data.
• Donor antibody status is associated with response to vaccines,
suggesting at least short-term adoption of donor memory cells.
• Killed vaccines are usually administered after IVIg has cleared from the
circulation.
• A full course of ‘childhood’ immunizations is required.
• Live viral vaccines should not be given until there is evidence of good
responses to killed or subunit vaccines and good in vitro T-cell function.
• Live vaccines should not be given any earlier than 24 months
post-HSCT, and only in patients without ongoing chronic GvHD or
immunosuppression.
• HSCT recipients are at particular risk of life-threatening encapsulated
bacterial infections due to functional hyposplenism.
• BCG is contraindicated post-HSCT.

GRAFT-VERSUS-HOST DISEASE (GVHD)

Results
• HSCT for acute leukaemia and lymphomas gives a 50-60% disease-free
survival in the ﬁrst complete remission, falling to 30% in the second
remission, and 15% in refractory disease.
• For SCID, the ﬁgures for long-term survival are dependent on the
closeness of the match, age at transplant, and the presence or absence
of infection at the time of transplant.
• In the best centres, over 90% survival is now regularly achieved
for early matched sibling transplants, falling to 30% survival for late
transplants in infected recipients with poor matches.

Gene therapy
• This is the holy grail of transplantation: engineering of the patient’s
own cells (preferably stem cells) to correct the genetic defect and
cure the disease.
• Complications such as GvHD are avoided and prolonged
immunosuppressive therapy is not required.
• The normal gene is delivered to the target cell using viral vectors
(range of viruses tried).
• Problems have been identiﬁed with controlling the sites of integration
of the inserted gene.
• The retroviral vector used to correct XL-SCID inserted close to
the LMO-2 gene (transcription factor involved in haematopoetic
cells development) and the retroviral long terminal repeat activated
the gene causing a T-cell leukaemia.
• For immunodeﬁciency, gene therapy has been successful in XL-SCID,
ADA-SCID, CGD. Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome is also a potential
target.
• Some transfers fail because of inadequate engraftment of transfected
stem cells.
• Where there is a matched sibling donor, standard stem cell
transplantation is still the preferred option.

Graft-versus-host disease (GvHD)
• GvHD occurs when transplanted immunocompetent donor T cells
recognize HLA mismatch and initiate an immune response.
• The major risk factor for development of GvHD is MHC disparity
between donor and recipient.
• GvHD may occur, despite good matching by molecular techniques,
because of:
• differences in the minor histocompatibility antigens
• non-MHC-encoded gene polymorphisms
• cytokine polymorphisms.
• A disease resembling GvHD may be seen in autologous transplants,
possibly caused by the development of autoreactive T cells.

375

376

CHAPTER 15

Transplantation

Acute GvHD (aGvHD)
• Severe aGvHD is now rare owing to improved matching and better
T-cell depletion, in combination with stem cell enrichment.
• aGvHD is deﬁned as occurring before an arbitrary 100-day period.
• Manifestations of aGvHD may occur after day 100 post-transplant.
• Classic chronic GvHD (cGvHD) may be present before day 100
and is better deﬁned by clinical manifestations than timing.
• Development of aGvHD is a cause of signiﬁcant morbidity and
mortality.
• Most deaths occur due to infection.
• Infection occurs in aGvHD due to the immunosuppression used to
treat it.
• aGvHD is itself immunosuppressive.
• aGvHD causes damage mainly to rapidly dividing tissues, particularly
affecting:
• skin
• liver
• gut.
• It is graded from I (mild) to IV (severe).
• Skin is most commonly affected site with typical distribution of rash
affecting palms and soles initially, progressing to face, head, and body.
• Main sign of GI involvement is diarrhoea (may be profuse).
• Hyperbilirubinaemia and raised ALP are seen with hepatic involvement.
• Diagnosis is usually obvious clinically.
• May be conﬁrmed on biopsy, showing inﬁltrates of mature T cells with
increased tissue MHC class II expression.
• Donor T cells in graft are causative.
• aGVHD may be reduced by T-cell depletion.
• Tissue damage occurs due to direct cellular toxicity and high cytokine
production (IL-1, TNFA, γ-IFN).
• Reduced intensity conditioning and cord donors are associated with a
decreased incidence of aGvHD.

Prevention of aGvHD
• aGvHD prevention is attempted using immunosuppression and T-cell
depletion.
• Prophylactic T-cell suppression is achieved with combinations of
methotrexate, ciclosporin, tacrolimus, and mycophenolate mofetil.
• T-cell depletion is associated with higher engraftment failure and
decreased graft-versus-tumour effect.

Treatment of aGvHD
Treatment of established aGvHD is difﬁcult.
• First-line therapy is high-dose steroids.
• Second-line therapy is anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG), Campath-1H,
anti-CD25, and/or anti-TNF monoclonal antibodies.
• Aggressive therapy early is important to prevent cGvHD.

CHRONIC GVHD (CGVHD)

Chronic GvHD (cGvHD)
• cGvHD is the most common non-relapse problem post-allogeneic
transplantation.
• Risk factors for cGvHD are:
• aGvHD (most important)
• increasing age
• donor-recipient gender mismatch
• MHC mismatch
• lack of T-cell depletion.
• Disease may evolve:
• directly from aGvHD (‘progressive’)
• following a period of resolution (‘interrupted’)
• de novo in patients with no history of aGvHD.
• De novo form has a good prognosis.
• Progressive form has a grim prognosis.
• Interrupted form has an intermediate prognosis.
• cGvHD has many features in common with systemic sclerosis and
collagen vascular disorders.
• Features occurring most commonly are:
• skin (lichen planus, pigmentation, scleroderma)
• liver (raised bilirubin, transaminases, and ALP)
• mouth (lichen planus, xerostomia, ulcers)
• eyes (keratoconjunctivitis sicca, corneal ulcerations).
• Any organ may be affected.
• Complications:
• gastrointestinal involvement results in ﬁbrosis, abnormal motility,
and malabsorption
• lung involvement may cause bronchiolitis obliterans and
bronchiectasis
• infection is the major cause of mortality.
• Dysregulation of the immune system and cGvHD therapy lead to
severe immunosuppression.
• Dysregulation leads to:
• autoantibody formation
• hypo- or hypergammaglobulinaemia
• CD8+ T-cell numbers are usually markedly increased.
• Steroids, mycophenolate mofetil, tacrolimus, and ciclosporin are used
for ﬁrst-line treatment.
• Second-line therapies include thalidomide, azathioprine, and
monoclonal antibody therapy.
• Response rates to treatment are generally poor.
• Untreated, all patients will die.

377

378

CHAPTER 15

Transplantation

Graft-versus-tumour (GvT) effect
• Anti-tumour activity is seen after stem cell transplantation in many
patients, including those with CML, CLL, acute leukaemia, multiple
myeloma, lymphoma, and renal cell carcinoma.
• GvT effect depends on minor and major histocompatibility mismatch
between donor and recipient.
• GvT is mediated by T cells and NK cells through receptors including
killer cell Ig-like receptors (KIR).
• Patients with mismatch have an increased risk of GvHD.
• Current GvHD prophylactic therapies also reduce GvT.
• Strategies to exploit genetic differences to improve GvT whilst
minimizing GvHD are being explored.

Graft failure
• Graft failure is associated with high mortality.
• Risk of failure is low with matched sibling, but rises with degree of
MHC mismatch:
• <5%, matched sibling
• 15-25%, 2-3 antigen mismatch.
• Failure can be deﬁned as early (<1 month) and late (>1 month).
• Key factors are:
• MHC mismatch
• conditioning (risk of graft failure reduced by increased conditioning)
• T-cell depletion
• post-transplant immunosuppression
• pre-transplant alloantigen sensitization (non-PID) by blood
transfusion, platelet transfusion.
• Graft rejection is mediated by T cells and NK cells.

Solid organ transplantation 1
Routine solid organ transplantation now includes kidney, liver, heart, lung,
and pancreas. The shortage of donor organs is the major barrier to transplantation. Frequently, organs are less than ideal in terms of matching and
the infection status of the donor.
• For cardiac transplantation and liver transplantation, MHC matching
is rarely carried out because of the need to proceed quickly with the
transplant procedure.
• Pancreatic transplants are matched for MHC and ABO status.
• For renal transplants more extensive matching is performed, including
testing for pre-formed antibodies.
• Eventual outcome depends on:
• minimizing transplant immunogenicity by optimizing care of donor
• reducing ischaemic time
• limiting reperfusion injury.

SOLID ORGAN TRANSPLANTATION 2: IMMUNOLOGY OF REJECTION

• Screening and matching for CMV status should be performed if
possible.
• High-dose IVIg, in combination with immunosuppressive therapy and
plasmapheresis, has been used in highly sensitized patients to reduce
anti-donor antibodies, especially antibodies against MHC Class II
antigens.
• Anti-rejection therapy is usually commenced with three drugs
(prednisolone, azathioprine, ciclosporin, tacrolimus, sirolimus
(rapamycin), or mycophenolate mofetil).
• Treatment is reduced to two drugs after an initial period of up to 6
months (depending on progress).
• It has been observed for many years that both random and donorspeciﬁc pre-transplant blood transfusions improve the outcome
(precise mechanism unclear).

Solid organ transplantation 2:
immunology of rejection
Solid organ rejection is divided into four phases, and these are applicable
to all types of organ.

Hyperacute rejection (<24 hours)
• Mediated by pre-formed complement-ﬁxing antibodies (usually antiMHC class I or anti-ABO).
• These cause neutrophil recruitment and vessel thrombosis through
platelet activation.
• There is fever and rapid loss of organ function.
• Often the organ is affected immediately, as soon as the clamps are
removed and the organ is revascularized.
• Eculizumab (anti-C5 MAb, which prevents C5 activation) is being used
experimentally to treat hyperacute rejection, but if this fails the organ
must be removed.

Accelerated rejection (3-5 days)
• Mediated by non-complement-ﬁxing antibodies and recruitment of
FcR-bearing cells.
• There is fever, swelling of the graft, and loss of function.
• Immunosuppression is only partially effective.
• Repeated attacks occur.
• Graft removal is usually required.

Acute rejection (6-90 days)
•
•
•
•

Mediated by T cells (CD4+ and CD8+ T cells involved).
Phagocytes are recruited.
Antibody may play a role.
Endothelium of the graft is a major target, along with interstitial
elements such as tubules.
• There is loss of function, graft swelling and tenderness, but less fever.

379

380

CHAPTER 15

Transplantation

• Early recognition and aggressive immunosuppression with pulsed
steroids and anti-T-cell monoclonal antibody therapy is often effective.
• It may recur and progress to chronic rejection.

Chronic rejection (>60 days)
• Precise mechanism is unknown.
• There is usually evidence of progressive ﬁbrosis, with vascular damage,
glomerular obliteration, ‘vanishing bile ducts’, bronchiolitis obliterans, or
accelerated coronary artery occlusion, depending on the organ grafted.
• Treatment is relatively ineffective and graft function is progressively
lost.

Prophylaxis of rejection
• In addition to the orally administered drugs, treatment with biologicals
may be valuable.
• Anti-CD3 MAb: OKT3 has now been withdrawn, but other
antibodies are being developed.
• Anti-IL2 (CD25): basiliximab and daclizumab (see
‘Immunosuppressive/immunomodulatory biologicals: anti-CD25
agents’, Chapter 16, p.419) are both used for prophylaxis of acute
rejection.
• Campath (anti-CD52, alemtuzumab; see ‘Immunosuppressive/
immunomodulatory biologicals: anti-B-cell agents, Chapter 16,
p.420) depletes T cells and has been used as induction therapy to
reduce the requirement for other immunosupressive agents.
• Belatacept (see ‘Immunosuppressive/immunomodulatory
biologicals: anti-co-stimulatory agents’, Chapter 16, p.420), which
blocks the B7 co-stimulatory pathway, is also being used as
induction therapy.

Solid organ transplantation 3:
immunosuppression and infection
after transplantation
• To maintain transplant tolerance, solid organ grafts are supported with
high levels of continuing immunosuppression over many years.
• This signiﬁcantly increases the long-term risk of:
• infections (including opportunistic)
• EBV-associated post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD)
• malignancy (particularly skin).
• Grafting organs from CMV-positive donors into CMV-negative
recipients may cause acute CMV infection in the post-transplant period.
• Latent CMV may reactivate even in recipients who are CMV status
matched.
• Valganciclovir or ganciclovir prophylaxis may reduce the incidence
and severity of such episodes.

SOLID ORGAN TRANSPLANTATION 4: LABORATORY TESTS

• Severe infection may be difﬁcult to treat in patients who remain on
high-dose immunosuppression.
• A decision may be required to reduce immunosuppression and risk
losing the graft.
• Improved chemotherapy regimens: PTLD treatment has been
improved with the primary use of anti-CD20 mAb (rituximab)
combined with antivirals, which has decreased immunosuppression.
• Preliminary data suggest that the use of autologous or allogeneic EBVspeciﬁc CTLs may have a signiﬁcant role in treatment.

Immune function post-transplant
• Immune function post-transplant should be considered.
• Azathioprine may produce a persistent humoral immunodeﬁciency
when used in high doses over long periods.
• Patients may then start to develop recurrent bacterial infections
and should be treated with replacement IVIg.
• Transplantation in early childhood (e.g. heart transplants) followed by
immunosuppression may cause problems by interfering with normal
immunological maturation, particularly with regard to the development
of anti-polysaccharide antibody responses.
• This is a problem mainly in those transplanted under the age of 2,
when these responses will not have developed.

Solid organ transplantation 4:
laboratory tests
• In the immediate post-transplant period the major clinical question is
the presence or absence of rejection or infection.
• Biopsy with immunostaining is the mainstay of diagnosis.
• Markers such as B2-microglobulin, sICAM-1, and sCD25 (IL-2R) may
have a certain predictive value, but also tend to rise in infection.
• Procalcitonin appears to be sensitive for bacterial sepsis and is not
elevated in rejection.
• Clinical assessment, knowledge of the temporal association of
complications, and tissue histology remain the key indicators to
distinguish infection from rejection.
• Patients on high-dose immunosuppression require monitoring of
peripheral lymphocyte subsets to ensure that drugs such as anti-CD3
and anti-CD20 are effective.
• ATG, in particular, suffers from batch-to-batch variation.
• Enumeration of T cells and B cells identiﬁes effective therapy with
B- and T-cell depleting agents.
• CH100 will identify effective blockade of C5 by eculizumab.
• Failure of therapy with xeno-antibodies may be due to development of
anti-mouse or anti-rabbit antibodies, which can be monitored.

381

382

CHAPTER 15

Transplantation

• Patients on long-term chronic immunosuppression require monitoring
of T- and B-cell numbers.
• Full investigation of T- and B-cell function may be necessary when
there are problems of recurrent infection in those on chronic
immunosuppression (see Chapter 2).
• This is particularly important in children receiving transplants
followed by immunosuppression early in life (under 2 years of age).

PASSIVE IMMUNIZATION

Introduction
The aim of this chapter is to give an overview of the very complex but
exciting area of immunotherapy. Despite great advances in the basic science, the results of clinical immunotherapy have not been as good as had
been hoped. Nonetheless, the advances in basic immunology continue to
provide new avenues to explore.

Major mechanisms of immunomodulation
• Immunization:
• active
• passive.
• Replacement therapy:
• immunoglobulin (IM, SC, IV)
• C1-esterase inhibitor
• A1-antitrypsin
• plasma.
• Immune stimulants:
• drugs
• cytokines.
• Immune suppressants:
• drugs
• monoclonal antibodies
• cytokines and antagonists
• IVIg
• antibody removal (plasmapheresis).
• Desensitization:
• bees and wasps
• other allergens.
• Anti-inﬂammatory agents:
• NSAIDs
• anti-cytokines (anti-TNF) IL-1ra
• anti-complement mAbs
• anti-endotoxin mAb
• anti-T cell/anti-B cell mAbs.
• Adoptive immunotherapy:
• bone marrow transplantation
• stem cell transplantation
• ?thymic transplants.

Passive immunization
Protection is provided by transfer of speciﬁc high-titre antibody from
donor to recipient. The effect is transient (maximum protection 6 months).
Protection is immediate (unlike active immunization).

385

386

CHAPTER 16

Immunotherapy

Problems
• Risk of transmission of viruses.
• Serum sickness (including demyelination), acute reactions.
• Development of antibodies against infused antibodies reduces
effectiveness.
• Identiﬁcation of suitable donors (Lassa fever, rabies).

Types
• Pooled speciﬁc human immunoglobulin.
• Animal sera (antitoxins, antivenins).
• ?Monoclonal antibodies (anti-endotoxin).

Uses
• Hepatitis A prophylaxis (but new vaccine provides active immunization
and longer prophylaxis).
• Hepatitis B (for needlestick injuries), tetanus, rabies, Lassa fever.
• Botulism, VZV (especially during pregnancy and in the
immunocompromised), diphtheria, snake bites (post-exposure).
• Rhesus incompatibility (post-delivery anti-D).

Active immunization
The purposes of active immunization are as follows.
• To stimulate the production of protective antibody (opsonization,
complement ﬁxation, enhanced phagocytosis, blocking uptake (virus
neutralization)).
• To stimulate antigen-speciﬁc T cells: whether these are Th1 or Th2
cells depends on the type of pathogen and the optimal protective
response.
• To produce long-lasting immunological memory (T and B cells).
• Mediated by the retention of antigen on follicular dendritic cells in
lymph nodes, leading to a long-term depot.
• Hence antibody levels often persist years after the primary course
of immunizations has been completed, rather than decaying to zero.
• To produce ‘herd immunity’: the generation of a sufﬁciently large pool
of immune individuals reduces the opportunity for wild-type disease to
spread, increasing the effectiveness of the immunization programme:
• immunization rates>75% are required to achieve this.
Active immunization can use:
• puriﬁed component, e.g. toxin (inactivated = toxoid)
• subcomponent
• live attenuated pathogen (e.g. BCG, polio).
Active immunizationcan be combined with passive immunization (although
this may reduce the development of long-term immunological memory).
• This approach is used for tetanus and rabies as a strategy for treatment
post-exposure.

GENERAL PROBLEMS OF ACTIVE IMMUNIZATION

Toxoid/subcomponent vaccines
•
•
•
•
•

Immune response frequently requires augmentation with adjuvants.
May be side effects from adjuvants.
No risk that disease will be produced.
Inactivation may damage key epitopes and reduce protection.
Safe to use in the immunocompromised but responses (and
protection) unpredictable.

Attenuated vaccines
• Usually more immunogenic and do not require adjuvants.
• Risk of reversion to wild type (e.g. polio).
• Side effects from culture contaminants (demyelination from duck
embryo rabies).
• May produce mild form of disease (measles, mumps).
• Contraindicated in immunosuppressed (paralytic polio in antibody
deﬁciency).
• Unexpected viral contaminants (SV40, polio; hepatitis B, yellow fever).

General problems of active
immunization
Active immunization has a number of problems, including the following.
• Allergy to any component (e.g. residual egg protein, often in viral
vaccines from the growth media).
• Reduced/absent responses in immunocompromised (including
splenectomy).
• Delay in achieving protection (primary and secondary immune
responses require multiple injection schedules).
• Preferred route of administration (site of IM; SC, ID):
• route of administration may determine the type of immune response
• route to be relevant for the route of infection of the pathogen (e.g.
need for mucosal immunity to enteric organisms).
• Storage: most live vaccines require refrigerated storage to maintain
potency; this may be a problem, especially in tropical countries.
• Age at which a vaccine is administered may alter the response, e.g.
responses to polysaccharide antigens are poor in:
• children under the age of 24 months
• the elderly.
• Maternal antibody, passive immunization, concomitant medical illness,
and associated drug therapy may reduce the response.
• Ideally, responses should be checked serologically in patients where
there may be a poor response.
• Serological unresponsiveness does not preclude good T-cell immunity
(hepatitis B).
• Anti-self-immune response to immunization (e.g. autoimmunity after
meningococcus group B polysaccharide administration).
• Multiple immunogenic strains of target organism (e.g. Meningococcus,
Pneumococcus).

387

388

CHAPTER 16

Immunotherapy

Additional stimulation of the immune
system
Poorly immunogenic antigens can be used if combined with agents that
non-speciﬁcally increase immune responses (‘adjuvants’). Adjuvants mimic
PAMPs (pathogen association molecular patterns), increase the innate
immune response via TLR, and augment the activity of dendritic cells macrophages and lymphocytes.
• Adjuvants.
• ‘Depot’ of antigen (alum-precipitated; oil), squalene
• Non-speciﬁc stimulation (Freund’s adjuvant, MDP). Freund’s
adjuvant is too potent to be used in humans! However, it has been
safely used in microlitre quantities.
• Polymerization (liposomes, ISCOMs—Quil A).
• dsDNA and ssDNA (which encourage endocytosis).
• unmethylated CpG dinucleotides.
• expression in vectors (e.g. use of vaccinia, chimeric viruses, BCG,
Salmonella).
• Virosomes (membrane-bound haemagglutinin and neuraminidase
from inﬂuenza virus)—facilitates uptake into antigen-presenting
cells.
• Use of immunogenic carrier proteins conjugated to primary antigen:
• tetanus toxoid
• diphtheria toxoid.

Modern approaches to vaccine
development
Development of more potent but safer vaccines is always the goal.
• Molecular techniques have been used to modify pathogens by sitespeciﬁc mutation, reducing pathogenicity, or inserting the gene into a
carrier (vaccinia, Salmonella).
• Development of the host response to the carrier organisms means
that it can only be used once.
• Molecular techniques allow the safe synthesis of bulk quantities of
antigen (e.g. hepatitis B surface antigen).
• Recombinant technique needs to be selected carefully to ensure
appropriate post-translational glycosylation of the antigen.
• Recombinant organisms can also be used to target antigens to
particular cells. For example:
• Salmonella is rapidly taken up by macrophages
• inserted gene products will also be directed straight to antigenpresenting cells.

MODERN APPROACHES TO VACCINE DEVELOPMENT

• Conjugation of poorly immunogenic antigens (such as polysaccharides)
to immunogenic proteins (tetanus, diphtheria toxoids).
• Humoral immune response to the polysaccharide switches from
IgG2 to IgG1 and IgG3.
• Speciﬁc peptides are being used experimentally to try to stimulate
speciﬁc T-cell responses.
• Epitope mapping of antigens to determine the T- and B-cell
epitopes is required.
• Direct injection into muscle of nucleic acid (RNA, DNA) coding for
speciﬁc genes, coupled to gold microsphere carriers or in plasmids,
generates an immune response.
• Nucleic acid is not degraded but is taken up into myocytes and
speciﬁc protein production can be detected for several months
thereafter, leading to an excellent depot preparation.
• Concern over risk of bystander attack by the immune system on
myocytes containing the injected DNA.

Generation of effective response
To generate an effective immune response, both host and pathogen factors need to be taken into account. Factors encouraging the development of an effective vaccine involve both infectious agent factors and host
factors.
• Infectious agent factors.
• One or a small number of serotypes; little or no antigenic drift.
• Pathogen is only moderately or poorly infectious.
• Antigens for B- and T-cell epitopes are readily available.
• The immune response can be induced readily at the site of natural
infection.
• Wild-type infection is known to produce protective immunity.
• Availability of animal models to test vaccine strategies.
• Host factors.
• Humoral and cellular immunity is readily induced.
• MHC background of population is favourable to a high response.
• Proposed antigens induce appropriate Th1 or Th2 response.
Factors in the infectious agent that mitigate against an appropriate immunization response and therefore prevent the development of good vaccines
include the following.
• Marked antigenic variation/drift; many serotypes causing disease. This
limits the ability to generate an effective vaccine (e.g. pneumococcal
disease).
• Potential for change in host range of the pathogen (e.g. change in cell
tropism of viruses such as HIV).
• Infection may be transmitted by infected cells that are not recognized
by the immune system even after immunization.
• Integration of viral DNA into the host genome (latency).
• Natural infection does not induce protective immunity.

389

390

CHAPTER 16

Immunotherapy

• Pathogen uses ‘escape’ mechanisms:
• resistant external coats (e.g. mycobacteria)
• poorly immunogenic capsular polysaccharides
• antigenic variation in response to host immune recognition (e.g.
inﬂuenza virus, malaria)
• camouﬂage with host proteins (e.g. CMV and B2-microglobulin)
• production of proteins similar to host proteins (e.g. enterobacteria)
may give rise to autoimmunity
• extracellular enzyme production to interfere with host defence
(staphylococcal protein A)
• production of molecules that disrupt immune responses (e.g.
superantigens).
• Pathogen-induced immunosuppression (HIV).
• Failure to form appropriate response (e.g. complement-ﬁxing
antibodies).
• No suitable animal model.
Host factors that mitigate against an appropriate immunization response
and therefore prevent the development of good vaccines include the
following.
• Immune response is inappropriate, e.g. antibody when cellular
response is required (e.g. leishmaniasis).
• Immune response enhances infection, e.g. antibody formation may
enhance infection through increased uptake into macrophages (yellow
fever, ?HIV).
• Cells of immune system are target of infection.
• ‘Wrong’ MHC background predisposes to low response or
autoimmunity.
The ultimate goal of any immunization programme is the eradication of
the disease. This requires that:
• the infection is limited only to humans
• there is no animal or environmental reservoir
• absence of any subclinical or carrier state in humans
• a high level of herd immunity can be established to prevent person-toperson spread:
• this requires considerable infrastructural support to ensure that all
at-risk populations are targeted for immunization
• this has only been achieved for smallpox
• however, herd immunity for smallpox has waned as immunization
programmes have stopped; bioterrorism with smallpox is a
signiﬁcant threat.

CHAPTER 16

Immunotherapy

Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) for
replacement therapy 1
Manufacture and speciﬁcation
• IVIg is a blood product prepared by cold ethanol precipitation of
pooled plasma.
• Donors are screened for transmissible infections (HIV, HCV, HBV).
• UK plasma is not currently used (risk of prion disease); no test
currently available to identify prion disease in donors.
• Donated plasma is usually quarantined until donor next donates
(avoids undetected infection at time of ﬁrst donation).
• Donor pool usually >1000 donors to ensure broad spectrum of
antibody speciﬁcities.
• Subsequent puriﬁcation steps vary between different manufacturers
but all are based on the original Cohn fractionation process.
• The IgA content is variable.
• Signiﬁcant levels of IgA may be important when treating IgAdeﬁcient patients, who may recognize the infused IgA as foreign and
respond to it, leading to anaphylactoid responses on subsequent
exposure.
• It is uncertain how much of a problem this is, and there is no
standardized method for detecting clinically signiﬁcant anti-IgA
antibodies.
• All current UK products have low/undetectable IgA.
• Product must have low levels of pre-kallikrein activator, Ig
fragments, and aggregates as these three can cause adverse events
on infusion.
• Variations of IgG subclasses do not seem to make signiﬁcant
differences to the effectiveness as replacement therapy.
• Comparing the presence of functional antibodies in individual products
is difﬁcult as there are no internationally standardized assays, but IVIg
must have intact opsonic and complement-ﬁxing function.
• All licensed products must have at least two validated antiviral steps:
• cold ethanol precipitation
• pH4/pepsin
• solvent/detergent treatment
• pasteurization
• nanoﬁltration.
• Model viruses are used to demonstrate that the process is effective
• No product should be viewed as virally ‘safe’.
• Full counselling about risks and beneﬁts must be given to patient,
with written information, and this must be recorded in the medical
notes.
• Written consent must be obtained prior to therapy and retained in
the medical notes.
• A pre-treatment serum sample should be stored, to facilitate ‘lookback’ exercises if required

IVIG FOR REPLACEMENT THERAPY 2

• Liquid preparations are now preferred for ease of administration.
• Most manufacturers are moving to 10% solutions, with more rapid
infusion times. 20% solutions of SCIg are now available; standard SCIg
is 16%.
• IVIg/SCIg is stabilized with sugars (e.g. maltose) or proline.

Uses
• IVIg (or SCIg—see ‘Intramuscular and subcutaneous immunoglobins
for replacement therapy’, p.396) is mandatory for replacement in:
• the major antibody deﬁciencies (XLA, CVID)
• combined immunodeﬁciencies (pre- and immediately post-BMT).
• IVIg is also recommended in patients with secondary
hypogammaglobulinaemia, such as CLL and myeloma, postchemotherapy etc. (see Chapter 2).
• The role of IVIg in IgG subclass and speciﬁc antibody deﬁciency is
less secure, and regular prophylactic antibiotics might be tried ﬁrst,
with IVIg reserved for continuing infection despite therapy (assess
risk-beneﬁt).
• Where there is doubt, a 1-year trial is reasonable, with monitoring of
clinical effectiveness through the use of symptom diaries.
• To ensure a realistic trial, adequate dosing and frequency of infusions
must be undertaken to ensure that beneﬁt will be obvious.

Dose regime
• Treatment should provide 0.2-0.6g/kg/month given every 2-3
weeks for primary antibody deﬁciency, or as an adjunct in combined
immunodeﬁciency.
• Older patients with CLL may manage on monthly infusions.
• Most patients on monthly schedules become non-speciﬁcally unwell or
develop breakthrough infections after 2-3 weeks.
• Under these circumstances the interval should be shortened.
• Rare hypercatabolic patients, or those with urinary or gastrointestinal
loss, may require weekly infusions of large doses to maintain levels.
• Adjust dose according to the trough IgG level, aiming to achieve a
trough IgG level within the normal range (6-16g/L).
• Aim for higher trough in patients with established bronchiectasis or
chronic sinusitis (target trough 9g/L), as this will reduce lung damage.
• Breakthrough infections are an indication to reassess interval and
target trough level.

IVIg for replacement therapy 2: adverse
reactions and risks of infection
Adverse reactions
• Most adverse reactions are determined by the speed of infusion and
the presence of underlying infection.
• Untreated patients receiving their ﬁrst infusions are at most risk.

393

394

CHAPTER 16

Immunotherapy

• Reactions are typical immune complex reactions:
• headache
• myalgia
• arthralgia
• fever
• bronchospasm
• hypotension
• collapse
• chest pain.
• Pre-treatment of the patient with antibiotics for 1 week prior to the
ﬁrst infusion reduces antigenic load and reaction risk.
• Hydrocortisone (100-200mg IV) and an oral antihistamine (cetirizine,
fexofenadine) given before the infusion are also of beneﬁt.
• The ﬁrst infusion should be given at no more than two-thirds of the
manufacturer’s recommended rate.
• Start slowly and increase rate in steps every 15 minutes.
• Similar precautions may be required before the second infusion.
• Reactions may occur in established recipients if:
• there is intercurrent infection
• there is a batch or product change.
• Other adverse events include:
• urticaria
• eczematous reactions
• delayed headache and fatigue (responds to antihistamines!)
• medical problems from transferred antibodies (e.g.
ANCA—uveitis).
• Aseptic meningitis—usually seen with hdIVIg, but occasionally with
replacement doses.
• Products should only be changed for clinical not ﬁnancial reasons.
• Severe anaphylactoid reactions have been reported after switching
products.
• IVIg products are not interchangeable.

Risk of infection
• Infection remains a major concern:
• hepatitis B is no longer an issue
• there have been a signiﬁcant number of outbreaks of hepatitis C
• other hepatitis viruses (HGV) may cause problems
• no risk of HIV transmission, as the process rapidly destroys the
virus
• safety in respect of prion disease is not known, but risk will be
cumulative with continuing exposure
• Antiviral steps reduce but do not eliminate risk.
• Batch exposure needs to be kept to a minimum.
• Batch records must be kept to facilitate tracing recipients.

IVIG FOR REPLACEMENT THERAPY 3

IVIg for replacement therapy 3:
monitoring and home therapy
Monitoring
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

•

Check HCV PCR and baseline LFTs pre-treatment.
Store pre-treatment serum long-term.
Monitor trough IgG levels on all patients regularly (alternate infusions).
Monitor liver function (alternate infusions, minimum every 3-4
months)—transmissible hepatitis.
• Repeat HCV PCR if any unexplained change in LFTs.
Monitor CRP—evidence of infection control.
2 Record batch numbers of all IVIg administered.
Use symptom diaries in appropriate patients to monitor infective
symptoms, antibiotic use, and time off work/school.
In the event of a signiﬁcant adverse reaction:
• immediate blood sampling for evidence of elevated mast-cell
tryptase, complement activation (C3, C4)
• send sample for anti-IgA antibodies (if IgA deﬁcient)
• screen for infection (CRP, cultures).
Rare antibody-deﬁcient patients seem to react persistently to IVIgs;
changing to a different product may sometimes assist. Occasionally
continued prophylactic antihistamines, paracetamol, or even steroids
may be required before each infusion to ensure compliance with
therapy.

Home therapy
• For patients with primary immunodeﬁciencies, home treatment is a
well-established alternative to hospital therapy.
• Criteria for entry to home therapy programmes are laid down in
approved guidelines (see Table 16.2).
• Speciﬁc centres in the UK are recognized as being able to provide
appropriate training.
• Patients should not be sent home on IVIg without formal training and
certiﬁcation by an approved centre.
• The centres will also arrange for long-term support, with trained home
therapy nurses and support from community pharmacy suppliers.
• UK Primary Immunodeﬁciency Network (www.ukpin.org.uk) can
provide details of approved centres in the UK. The International
Patient Organization for Primary Immunodeﬁciencies (IPOPI) can
provide details of overseas contacts.
• Home therapy is not available in all countries for legal and/or ﬁnancial
reasons.

Intramuscular and subcutaneous
immunoglobulins for replacement
therapy
Intramuscular immunoglobulin (IMIg)
There is no role for IMIg in replacement therapy. Administered doses are
too low to be effective in preventing infection. However, occasional older
patients prefer the convenience of a weekly injection at their GP’s surgery
to hospital-based infusions. IMIg has been associated with an adverse reaction rate of 20%.

Subcutaneous immunoglobulin (SCIg)
For those with poor venous access, high-dose SCIg replacement is at least
equivalent to IVIg in terms of maintaining adequate trough IgG levels and
preventing infection.
• 16% solution of immunoglobulin is used; 20% solution now also
available.
• Speciﬁc licensed SCIg preparations are now available from several
manufacturers.
• It is administered via a syringe driver in a weekly dose of 100mg/kg at
multiple sites.
• One or two infusion pumps may be used, depending on type and
availability.

C1-ESTERASE INHIBITOR FOR REPLACEMENT THERAPY

• Rate is usually set to the maximum; some pumps use restrictors on the
giving sets.
• Usual maximum tolerated dose is 10mL per site; products with
enzymes to aid dispersal are being developed and may allow larger
doses to be given at single sites.
• Tolerability is reasonable, with local irritation being the only signiﬁcant
side effect.
• Home therapy can be undertaken (for guidance, see ‘IVIg for
replacement therapy 3’, p.395).
• Regular trips to hospital or GP will be required for trough IgG and LFT
and CRP monitoring.
• Trough levels tend to run approximately 1g/L higher than the same
dose given as IVIg on a 2-3-weekly cycle.
• Syringe drivers must be checked at least annually by a qualiﬁed medical
electronics technician.

C1-esterase inhibitor for replacement
therapy
Deﬁciency of C1-esterase inhibitor causes episodic angioedema, which
may be fatal if it involves the upper airway (see Chapter 1).
• Puriﬁed C1 inhibitor is available in the UK as Berinert®, Cinryze®, and
Ruconest®.
• These are blood-derived products and carry the same risks as IVIg with
respect to tranmissible infections.
• Products undergo viral inactivation steps (steam treatment).
• Patients should have samples checked for LFTs and HCV status prior
to each course of treatment.
• Appropriate consent should be obtained if possible.
• Batch numbers must be recorded.
• Indications for treatment include:
• attacks above the shoulders
• surgical prophylaxis (including major dental work).
• Weekly administration has been used in pregnancy where there are
frequent severe attacks.
• It is less effective against bowel oedema, but if pain is severe one dose
should be given.
• Attacks involving the bowel should be treated with ﬂuids, analgesics,
and NSAIDs.
• Surgery should be avoided unless there is good evidence for
pathology unrelated to HAE.
• Dose is 500-1500U (1-3 ampoules) administered as a slow bolus IV.
• Manufacturer’s information and guidelines suggest that the higher
dose is required, but this is not always true.
• Levels of C1-esterase inhibitor level in the serum should rise to
>50% for several days.
• Same dose is used for prophylaxis.

397

398

CHAPTER 16

Immunotherapy

0 When used as treatment, it will prevent attacks progressing, but will
not lead to a dramatic resolution of symptoms. Accordingly, laryngeal
oedema may require other measures, such as tracheostomy, as urgent
procedures.
• Recombinant C1-esterase inhibitor, produced in rabbit milk (Rhucin®),
is now available; known allergy to rabbits precludes treatment because
of a risk of anaphylaxis. Recipients must be screened annually for
the development of anti-rabbit IgE antibodies. It has a short half-life
compared with Berinert® and therefore is only suitable for acute
treatment.
• Puriﬁed-blood-derived nanoﬁltered C1 esterase inhibitor, Cinryze®,
is also now licensed, As it is blood derived, unlike Rhucin®, normal
precautions relating to the use of blood products should be observed,
as for Berinert®.
• Plasma can be used if the puriﬁed concentrate is unavailable, but is
less effective and may even increase the oedema by providing fresh
substrate for the complement and kinin cascades.
• Pooled virally inactivated fresh frozen plasma is now available, and
may carry a reduced risk of infection, although this is debated.
• On the whole, plasma should be avoided unless there is no
alternative in the emergency situation.

Other immunotherapies for hereditary
angioedema (HAE)
Other therapies for the acute treatment of HAE, which avoid the use of
blood-derived and recombinant C1 esterase inhibitor, are now available.
• Icatibant (Firazyr®) is a bradykinin B2 receptor blocking drug, which is
effective at reducing the symptoms of acute attacks of HAE.
• It is administered as a subcutaneous injection of 30mg (repeated
once if necessary after 6 hours).
• It is now licensed for self-administration at home in the UK, and
there is a home support programme in place.
• It has a short half-life and therefore is not suitable for prophylaxis
for surgery.
• Injections can be painful and may limit uptake.
• Ecallantide (Dy88) is an inhibitor of plasma kallikrein and is licensed in
the USA but not Europe for treatment of acute attacks.
• The main concern is the risk of anaphylaxis from the drug (not
good in patients with angioedema!!).

A1-Antitrypsin (A1-AT) for replacement
therapy
A1-AT deﬁciency leads to progressive emphysema and liver disease. Puriﬁed
A1-AT is now available on a named-patient basis. Trials have not been that

IMMUNE STIMULATION

encouraging, but this is because late-stage patients with established disease
have been involved. No good prophylactic trials have been undertaken in
asymptomatic patients, so it is not yet known how effective the drug is in preventing complications. Supplementation may also be useful during acute infections when high local levels of trypsin are released by activated neutrophils.
Infusions need to be given at least weekly to maintain enzyme activity.

Mannan binding lectin (MBL) for
replacement therapy
Trials of MBL replacement therapy in deﬁcient patients have not shown
any signiﬁcant clinical beneﬁt.

Immune stimulation
Speciﬁc immunostimulation
Speciﬁc immune stimulation = immunization (see ‘Passive immunization’
and ‘Active immunization’, pp 385-90).

Non-speciﬁc immunostimulation
• A number of agents which act as non-speciﬁc immune stimulators and
have signiﬁcant clinical beneﬁt are now available.
• Specialist literature should be consulted for current dose regimes.
BCG
• Direct stimulant of immune system; activates macrophages.
• Only found to be of value in bladder cancer.
• As it is a live agent, it should not be administered to those with
concomitant immunosuppression (lymphoid malignancy, drug-induced).
• Derivative of cell wall muramyl dipeptide (MDP) licensed in Japan to
enhance bone marrow recovery after chemotherapy.
• Other bacterial products (extracts of Corynebacterium) are under
investigation as immunostimulants.
Cimetidine
• Known to have immunoregulatory properties, not related to anti-H2
activity, as actions do not appear to be shared with other anti-H2
drugs such as ranitidine.
• Thought to reduce T-suppressor activity.
• Has been used with success in the hyper-IgE syndrome to reduce IgE
and in CVID to increase IgG production.
Glatiramer (copaxone)
• An immunostimulatory drug, comprising synthetic peptides, which is
administered by injection.
• Used in the treatment of relapsing and remitting multiple sclerosis.
• Side effects include chest pain, allergic reactions, and
lymphadenopathy.

CHAPTER 16

Immunotherapy

G-CSF/GM-CSF
• Act on bone marrow precursors to increase production of mature
neutrophils.
• Used as adjuncts to chemotherapy to prevent or reduce neutropenic
sepsis.
• Used to mobilize stem cells for apheresis.
• Used to treat congenital neutrophil disorders: Kostman’s syndrome,
cyclic neutropenia, idiopathic neutropenia.
• PEGylated form of G-CSF available to increase duration of action.
• May increase the risk of myeloid malignancy.
• Do not use in Kostman’s syndrome where there are cytogenetic
abnormalities, as risk of malignant transformation is increased.
• Bone pain may be a side effect.
Interleukin-2 (Aldesleukin)
• Licensed for use in metastatic renal cell carcinoma.
• Can produce tumour shrinkage, but no increase in survival.
• IV administration is associated with a severe capillary leak syndrome.
• Rarely used.
α-interferon
• Main use now is in treatment of hepatitis C, in combination with
ribavirin.
• PEGylated interferon is available to increase duration of action.
• Also valuable in carcinoid tumours, hairy cell leukaemia and
lymphomas, myeloma, melanoma, and hepatitis B.
• Side effects can be severe and include severe ﬂu-like symptoms and
a severe depressive state (suicide may be provoked). Patients with a
history of depression should not receive A-IFN.
• Dose is determined by the condition treated.
β-interferon
• Used in the treatment of relapsing and remitting multiple sclerosis
(although support from NICE has been equivocal at best).
• Side effects similar to those of A-interferon but may also cause
humoral immune abnormalities. Monitoring of serum immunoglobulins
pre- and post-treatment is recommended.
γ-interferon (Immukin®)
• G-IFN-1b is used as adjunctive therapy in patients with chronic
granulomatous disease for prevention and treatment of infections.
• It can also be used to increase response rate to HBV vaccination in
poor responders.
• Side effects include severe ﬂu-like symptoms.
• Dose is usually 50-100μg/m2 three times a week.
Levamisole
• Originally introduced as an anti-parasitic drug.
• Found to increase circulating T cells, activate macrophages, and
enhance DTH reactions.
• Used in RhA and as an adjuvant in colonic cancer (FDA approved).
• May cause agranulocytosis (in HLA B27+ patients).

IMMUNOSUPPRESSIVE/ IMMUNOMODULATORY DRUGS

Immunosuppressive/
immunomodulatory drugs:
corticosteroids
These drugs are based on endogenous products of the adrenal cortex and
form the mainstay of immunosuppressive therapy; synthetic compounds
are more potent. Natural steroids are highly plasma bound (corticosteroid-binding globulin, albumin). Actions of corticosteroids are manifold.

Actions
• Transiently increased neutrophils (decreased margination and release
of mature neutrophils from marrow).
• Decreased phagocytosis and release of enzymes (lysosomal
stabilization).
• Marked monocytopenia and reduced monokine (IL-1) production.
• Alteration of cellular gene expression (high-afﬁnity cytoplasmic
receptor translocated to nucleus) via nFκB inhibition through
increased cytoplasmic concentrations of IκBa.
• Release of lipomodulin (inhibits phospholipase A2 with reduction of
arachidonic acid metabolites).
• Lymphopenia due to sequestration in lymphoid tissue and interference
with recirculation (CD4+ T cells > CD8+ T cells > B cells) and
lymphocytotoxic effects (high doses).
• Decreased T-cell proliferative responses (inhibit entry into G1 phase).
• Reduced serum IgG and IgA.
• No effect on NK or antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity
(ADCC) activity.

Side effects
• Carbohydrate metabolism: poor cellular glucose uptake, increased
hepatic gluconeogenesis, and glycogen deposition.
• Increased lipolysis and free fatty acid (FFA); increased selective fat
deposition.
• Inhibit protein synthesis and enhance protein catabolism.
• Increase glomerular ﬁltration rate (GFR) and sodium retention;
decrease calcium absorption, inhibit osteoblasts.
• Clinical side effects are multitudinous:
• diabetes
• hyperlipidaemia
• obesity
• poor wound healing
• growth arrest (children)
• myopathy
• hypertension
• purpura and skin thinning
• cataracts
• glaucoma
• peptic ulcer
• allergy (synthetic steroids)

401

402

CHAPTER 16

Immunotherapy

• avascular necrosis
• psychiatric complications
• thrush.
• Patients on medium- to long-term treatment require regular checks of
blood pressure, blood sugar, and bone mineral density.
• Prophylactic therapy against bone loss is highly desirable, especially in
females and all older patients.
• Optimal therapy is yet to be determined but includes hormone
replacement therapy (HRT), if not contraindicated by underlying
disease, vitamin D and calcium, or oral bisphosphonate.
• Doses of over 20mg/day for long periods may increase the risk of
opportunist infection with Pneumocystis carinii; therefore consideration
should be given to the use of low-dose co-trimoxazole.

Uses
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Autoimmune diseases (e.g. SLE, vasculitis, rheumatoid arthritis).
Polymyalgia rheumatica, giant-cell arthritis.
Allergic diseases (asthma, hay fever).
Inﬂammatory diseases (Crohn’s disease).
Malignant disease (lymphoma).
Allograft rejection.
Other immunological diseases (ITP, glomerulonephritis).

Dosage regimes
• Variable according to the disease being treated, and up-to-date
literature should always be consulted.
• Prednisolone is the stock drug. Other steroids have little advantage
but the British National Formulary has equivalency tables.
• Enteric-coated tablets are kinder to patients, but may lead to erratic
absorption.
• If plain steroids are used, gastroprotection with either an
H2-antagonist or a proton pump inhibitor is most effective in
preventing ulceration.
• Low-dose steroids for RhA (prednisolone 7.5mg/day) have been used.
Most patients are now on methotrexate or anti-TNF agents.
• Higher doses (up to 30mg/day) are required for SLE (larger doses for
cerebral lupus).
• Life-threatening immunological disease requires much higher doses:
1-2mg/kg orally or IV.
• Various pulsed regimes using IV methylprednisolone have been
advocated, especially in acute vasculitis. The evidence is split over their
effectiveness: 10mg/kg is advocated, pulsed at varying intervals, often in
combination with IV cytotoxics.
• Topical steroids with limited absorption are invaluable in controlling
local allergic symptoms (asthma, hay fever).
• Where patients who have been on long-term steroids are being
tapered, they will remain adrenally suppressed for up to 6 months
after cessation of therapy and therefore should have steroid cover for
illnesses, operations, etc. Patients should carry warning cards.

IMMUNOSUPPRESSIVE/ IMMUNOMODULATORY DRUGS

Immunosuppressive/
immunomodulatory cytotoxic
drugs: azathioprine
Azathioprine is converted in vivo to 6-mercaptopurine and acts to inhibit
the synthesis of inosinic acid (precursor of purines), thus inhibiting DNA
synthesis and reducing cell replication.

Actions
• Preferentially inhibits T-cell activation rather than B-cell activation.
• Reduces the circulation of large ‘activated’ lymphocytes, but has little
effect on small resting lymphocytes.
• Long-term use causes signiﬁcant lymphopenia (T and B cells).
• Hypogammaglobulinaemia, due to inhibition of B-cell proliferation (less
or no effect on T-cell proliferation).
• Suppression of monokine production.

Side effects
• Causes profound bone marrow suppression. This is related to
deﬁciency alleles of the enzyme thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT)
involved in its metabolism.
• Screening for enzyme levels is widely available.
• Toxic hepatitis (?related to TPMT deﬁciency).
• Opportunist infections (including HSV, papillomaviruses).
mnosuppressive/immunomodulatory cytotoxic drugs
• Gastric upset (probably unrelated to TPMT deﬁciency).
• Teratogenicity.
• ?Malignancy (lymphoma).
• PUO syndrome (hypersensitivity).

Uses
• Autoimmune diseases (SLE, rheumatoid arthritis, vasculitis, liver
disease, myasthenia, inﬂammatory bowel disease).
• As a steroid-sparing agent.

Dosage
• In view of the potential for severe/fatal side effects, azathioprine must
be introduced carefully.
• Initial dose should not exceed 1mg/kg and the patient should receive
weekly FBCs with a differential white count for the ﬁrst month of
therapy.
• If there is any drop in platelets or white cells, it is unsafe to continue
with therapy.
• Deﬁciency alleles for TPMT are present in 1 in 300 of the population;
pre-treatment screening is helpful.
• If it is tolerated, the dose can be increased to 2.5mg/kg (or in special
circumstances to 4mg/kg).
• The need for continuing therapy needs to be reviewed regularly.

403

404

CHAPTER 16

Immunotherapy

• Hypogammaglobulinaemia may be severe and require replacement
therapy, although recovery may eventually occur over several years.
• Liver function tests must also be monitored.
0 Allopurinol is contraindicated with azathioprine as it interferes with
elimination and raises blood levels.

Immunosuppressive/
immunomodulatory cytotoxic drugs:
cyclophosphamide and chlorambucil
(alkylating agents)
These drugs bind to and cross-link DNA, and possibly also RNA, thus
interfering with DNA replication and transcription. Effects depend on the
phase of the cell cycle during exposure and the competence of the DNA
repair mechanisms.

Actions
• Dose-dependent lymphopenia (T (CD8 > CD4) and B cells).
• Reduced B-cell proliferation and antibody synthesis (reduced IgG and
IgM).
• Lesser effect on T cells (CD8 >> CD4, which may actually enhance
T-cell responsiveness under certain circumstances).

Side effects
• Bone marrow depression.
• Alopecia.
• Haemorrhagic cystitis (caused by acrolein)—ensure good hydration
and use mesna for doses >200mg/kg. May be less risk with pulsed IV
therapy.
• Sterility (males and females—offer males sperm banking, warn all
patients of reproductive age, and record in notes).
• Secondary lymphoid neoplasms (especially NHL (11-fold increase),
bladder tumours (10% long-term), skin tumours (ﬁvefold increase), and
acute myeloblastic leukaemia).
• Opportunist infections (use co-trimoxazole and antifungal prophylaxis).
• Nausea and vomiting (high dose).

Major uses
• Vasculitis, especially Wegener’s granulomatosis, PAN, MPA, CSS.
• SLE and RhA.
• Glomerulonephritis (including Goodpasture’s syndrome).

Dosage
• There is considerable debate over the optimal regimes for use of
cyclophosphamide.
• Continuous low-dose oral cyclophosphamide (2-4mg/kg/day).

IMMUNOSUPPRESSIVE/ IMMUNOMODULATORY DRUGS

•
•
•
•

• Intravenous pulse therapy (10mg/kg/pulse or 0.75-1g/m2 body
surface area; intervals determined by protocol and blood counts).
Long-term side effects may be higher with continuous oral therapy,
but this may reﬂect the higher total dose, and lower doses may be
effective.
In life-threatening conditions, high-dose IV pulses, with IV steroids, will
have a faster effect (remember mesna cover and IV ﬂuids).
Chlorambucil is used orally in doses of 0.03-0.06mg/kg/day and is less
toxic to the bladder than cyclophosphamide, but is probably equally
toxic to bone marrow in therapeutic doses.
Dosages of both drugs will require adjustment in renal impairment.
Regular blood counts are required, according to current local
protocols.

Immunosuppressive/
immunomodulatory cytotoxic drugs:
methotrexate (MTX)
Methotrexate is a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase and impairs synthesis of tetrahydrofolate from folic acid (required
as cofactor for thymidine synthesis). Therefore it interferes with DNA
synthesis. It is also thought to interfere with other intracellular enzymes.
As an immunosuppressive agent it is used in low weekly doses (much
lower than the doses used as an anti-neoplastic agent). Low-dose MTX
probable inhibits the enzyme 5-amino-imidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide (AICAR) transformylase, leading to the accumulation of AICAR
and increased adenosine.

Actions
•
•
•
•
•

Variable effects on lymphocyte numbers in peripheral blood.
Possible inhibition of monokine production.
Inhibition of lipo-oxygenase pathway.
Reduction in antibody synthesis.
Converted to methotrexate polyglutamates, which persist long term
intracellularly and are potent inhibitors of AICAR tranformylase and
dihydrofolate reductase.

Side effects
• Mucositis, nausea, and vomiting.
• Bone marrow suppression (megaloblastic—may be reversed by
folinic acid rescue); may be worse if other anti-folate drugs are
co-administered (e.g. sulfasalazine, co-trimoxazole).
• Hepatic ﬁbrosis (dose-related).
• Pneumonitis (5% of patients), a hypersensitivity reaction.
• Sterility.

Uses
• RhA; psoriatic arthropathy.

405

406

CHAPTER 16

Immunotherapy

• Polymyositis/dermatomyositis.
• GvHD in BMT.
• Adjunctive therapy with inﬂiximab (see ‘Immunosuppressive/
immunomodulatory biologicals: anti-TNF agents’, p.416).

Dosage
• The drug is given weekly either orally or IM.
• Initial dose is 7.5mg (adult), increased stepwise depending upon side
effects and clinical beneﬁt to a maximum of 20-30mg/week.
• Dose may need reducing in renal impairment.
• Care needs to be taken with co-administration of other drugs.
• Folinic acid may reduce risk of bone marrow toxicity and mucositis
(given 24-36 hours later). Folic acid will not be effective as MTX
inhibits its conversion to the active form.
1The most frequent cause of side effects, including death, is the inadvertent daily administration of the drug—always check carefully. Do
not rely on pharmacy systems to spot errors.
• Baseline tests should include FBC, LFTs, CXR, and lung function.
• Monitor weekly (initially) pre-dose FBCs and regular LFTs.
• If abnormal LFTs are noted, the drug dose should be reduced or
the drug stopped.
• It is thought that the risks of monitoring for liver disease by biopsy
outweigh any beneﬁt.
• Development of pneumonitis is an absolute indication for withdrawing
the drug; high-dose steroids may be required.

Immunosuppressive/
immunomodulatory cytotoxic drugs:
2-chlorodeoxyadenosine (2CDA,
cladribine) and ﬂudarabine
• Mode of action is by inhibition of adenosine deaminase, i.e. effectively
producing ADA-deﬁcient severe combined immunodeﬁciency.
• Primary use is in the treatment of haematological malignancy (B-cell
tumours) but, with careful use, they have the potential to be potent
immunosuppressive agents.
• Both produce a profound and long-lasting B-cell and CD4+ T-cell
lymphopenia.
• Prophylactic antibiotics (co-trimoxazole) and antifungals are advisable.
• Long-term monitoring of lymphocyte surface markers and serum
immunoglobulins is advisable after treatment.

IMMUNOSUPPRESSIVE/IMMUNOMODULATORY DRUGS

Immunosuppressive/
immunomodulatory drugs:
ciclosporin (CyA)/tacrolimus (FK506)/
sirolimus (rapamycin)
These three agents are macrolide antibiotics derived from fungi. They act
speciﬁcally on T-helper cells, but leave other cell types unaffected. Target
cells are inhibited but not killed (therefore effects are fully reversible on
cessation of treatment).

Modes of action
• Ciclosporin (CyA) interacts with cyclophilin, a 17kDa protein
(peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase), and tacrolimus interacts with
FK-BP12, a 12kDa protein similar to cyclophilin.
• The complex prevents calcineurin, a calcium- and calmodulindependent protein, from dephosphorylating the nuclear factor of
activated T cells (NF-AT), reducing transcription of the IL-2 gene.
• Immunosuppressive activity is not directly related to this activity.
• CyA and tacrolimus inhibit IL-2 and IL-2Ra gene expression and
prevent T-cell activation (cells arrested at G0/G1).
• Sirolimus has no effect on IL-2 production; it binds FK-BP, but the
complex does not inhibit calcineurin. It appears to block calciumindependent signalling (via CD28) and inhibits mTOR.
• May interfere with macrophage function (lymphokine release and
receptor synthesis).
• CyA interferes with B-cell proliferation and antibody production.

Side effects
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Hypertension.
Hirsutism.
Nephrotoxicity.
Hepatotoxicity.
Lymphomas (NHL—85% EBV+).
Opportunist infections (CMV, papillomaviruses, HHV-8).
Neurotoxicity.
Multiple drug interactions (CyA and tacrolimus induce cytochrome
P450(IIEI)).
• Diabetes (inhibition of insulin release).
• Headache.

Uses
• Combination therapy for allografts.
• RhA, SLE.
• Autoimmune diseases (uveitis, Behçet’s syndrome, inﬂammatory bowel
disease).

407

408

CHAPTER 16

Immunotherapy

Dosage
• CyA and tacrolimus are available orally and intravenously.
• Dosage for CyA depends on the circumstances, but 10-15mg/kg/day
may be required for allograft rejection, while 5mg/kg may sufﬁce for
autoimmune disease.
• Tacrolimus dosage is 0.1-0.3mg/kg/day for allograft rejection.
Experience of this drug is less in autoimmune disease, but doses up to
0.1mg/kg/day in divided doses appear to be effective.
• Monitoring of drug levels is desirable for both drugs; this can prevent
toxicity and monitor compliance.
• Sirolimus dosage is 6mg as a stat dose followed by 2mg daily, with drug
monitoring and appropriate dosage changes, in allografts. Dosages for
use in autoimmune disease are not deﬁned.
• Because it operates on different activation pathways it may make a
useful combination treatment.
• Creatinine and electrolytes, liver function, and blood pressure should
be monitored regularly.
• 0Now that generic versions are available it is essential that the brand
is speciﬁed, especially in the transplant setting, as the bioavailability of
the different products is NOT the same. Transplanted organs have
been lost because of inadvertent product switches.

Immunosuppressive/
immunomodulatory drugs:
mycophenolate mofetil (MMF)
Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF; CellCept®)
This drug is a prodrug of mycophenolic acid. Its actions are similar to those
of azathioprine and it can be used as a replacement. It is usually well tolerated. Mycophenolic acid (Myfortic®) can be used as an alternative and may
be tolerated where MMF is not.
Actions
• Blocks inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase and synthesis of
guanine, but has no effect on salvage pathway.
• It acts predominantly on lymphocytes to prevent proliferation, but has
little effect on non-lymphoid cells.
Side effects
• Lymphopenia.
• Opportunist infections (CMV, HSV), PML.
• Lymphoma.
• Hepatotoxicity, pancreatitis.
• Electrolyte disturbance (hyperkalaemia, hypomagnesemia,
hypocalcaemia).
• Breathing problems and pleural effusions; pulmonary ﬁbrosis.

IMMUNOSUPPRESSIVE/IMMUNOMODULATORY DRUGS

Uses
• Prophylaxis of allograft rejection
• Autoimmune disease: SLE nephritis, uveitis.
Dosage
• Dosage is 1g twice daily, increased to maximum of 1.5g twice daily.
• It is also available for intravenous infusion.
• Myfortic® is given in a dose of 720mg twice daily (equivalent to MMF
1g twice daily).
• FBC and LFTs should be monitored regularly.

Immunosuppressive/
immunomodulatory drugs:
leﬂunomide
• After oral administration leﬂunomide is converted to an active
metabolite that inhibits dihydro-orotate dehydrogenase (involved in
pyrimidine synthesis and required by T cells).
• T-cell proliferation is blocked.
• Used in RhA: as effective as methotrexate.
• Onset of action is slow (4-6 weeks).
• Side effects include severe hepatotoxicity and Stevens-Johnson
syndrome.
• Drug can be ‘washed-out’ with colestyramine or activated charcoal
(binds it in the gut).
• It is teratogenic: effective contraception is required.
• Dose is 100mg daily for 3 days, and then 10-20mg daily.
• Monitoring with regular FBC and LFTs mandatory.

Immunosuppressive/
immunomodulatory drugs:
D-penicillamine and gold
D-penicillamine

This enigmatic drug comes and goes in terms of its utility as an
immunomodulator.
• Precise immunological actions are not known.
• It decreases antibody production.
• It inhibits T-cell proliferation, possibly through enhanced hydrogen
peroxide production or sulphydrylation of the surface receptors of
the lymphocytes.
• Neutrophil chemotaxis and oxidative function are impaired.
• Macrophage antigen-presenting function and monokine production
are reduced.

409

410

CHAPTER 16

Immunotherapy

• Also believed to inhibit collagen synthesis; hence its use in
scleroderma.
• Very slow in its onset of action.
• Main side effects include a range of autoimmune diseases, including
myasthenia gravis, renal disease (nephrotic), SLE, polymyositis, and
Goodpasture’s syndrome.
• Mainly used in RhA and scleroderma, but has fallen out of favour
because of side effects.
• Dosage is 250mg daily increased to 1g daily.
• Regular monitoring (every 1-2 weeks initially) of renal function,
urinalysis, and FBC required.
• Penicillin-allergic patients may be at increased risk of reacting to
penicillamine.

Gold
• Gold may be given either as IM injections or orally. Evidence suggests
that parenteral therapy is more effective.
• Concentrated selectively in macrophages and reduces monokine
production (IL-1). Hence it also reduces T- and B-cell responses.
• Impairs endothelial expression of adhesion molecules and hence
reduces cellular trafﬁc to sites of inﬂammation.
• Proﬁle of side effects is similar to that of penicillamine, and the onset
of action is also slow.
• It is used only in RhA—now mainly replaced by anti-TNF agents and
methotrexate.
• Dosage depends on the route, and expert advice on current regimes
should be sought from a clinician experienced in its use.

Immunosuppressive/
immunomodulatory drugs:
hydroxychloroquine/mepacrine
• Antimalarials have a particular role to play in the management of joint
and skin complaints in connective tissue diseases.
• Effective in relieving the fatigue experienced in association with
connective tissue diseases such as SLE and Sjögren’s syndrome.
• Mode of clinical action is uncertain.
• Interfere with the production of cytokines and reduction of
production of granulocyte lysosomal enzymes. Drug accumulates in
lysosomes.
• Decrease chemotaxis, phagocytosis, and superoxide production in
neutrophils
• Inhibit TLR9 and reduce antigen presentation by dendritic cells to
T cells.
• Anti-platelet action demonstrated: may be valuable in antiphospholipid syndrome.
• Onset of action is slow.

IMMUNOSUPPRESSIVE/IMMUNOMODULATORY DRUGS

• Well-tolerated with few side effects.
• Haemolysis may occur in G6PD-deﬁcient patients.
• Retinal toxicity may be a problem with hydroxychloroquine, and is
deﬁnitely a problem with chloroquine (no longer used in rheumatic
disease).
• Evidence that there is a signiﬁcant risk of ocular toxicity from
normal doses of hydroxychloroquine is minimal. Cumulative dose
>1000g is associated with risk.
• Annual follow-up by optometrist recommended
• Near vision should be recorded with test type before starting
treatment, and at 6-12-month intervals thereafter.
• Loss of colour discrimination may be an early sign.
• Hydroxychloroquine may cause nausea and vomiting which can be
severe and usually occurs during the initiation phase.
• Haemolysis may occur in G6PD-deﬁcient individuals—this affects
children more than adults.
• Mepacrine stains the skin yellow.
• Preferred antimalarial is hydroxychloroquine.
• Starting dose for hydroxychloroquine is 400mg/day (adult), reducing
to maintenance of 200mg/day. Alternatively the maximum daily
dose is calculated as 6.5mg/kg lean body mass.
• Mepacrine is an unlicensed drug in the context of autoimmune disease,
and the dose is 50-100mg/day.

Immunosuppressive/
immunomodulatory drugs: thalidomide
and analogues/pentoxifylline
• Thalidomide is an interesting drug which reduces the severity of
conversion reactions due to treatment of lepromatous leprosy.
• Mechanisms of action include:
• potent inhibition of TNFA production by monocytes, as a result of
interference with gene transcription
• decrease in the expression of adhesion molecules
• reduction of circulating CD4+ T cells/immunomodulatory drugs
• inhibition of G-interferon production by T cells, as a result of
preferential stimulation of Th2 cells
• inhibition of angiogenesis
• inhibition of IL-6 production
• activation of apoptotic pathways via caspase 8.
• Side effects include its well-documented teratogenicity, neuropathy,
and drowsiness (which may limit dose).
• It is used in the management of ulceration in Behçet’s syndrome and in
reducing the severity of GvHD.
• It is used with beneﬁt in multiple myeloma, with dexamethasone.
• Dosage is 100mg/day, reducing to 50mg on alternate days.

411

412

CHAPTER 16

Immunotherapy

• It is an unlicensed drug in the UK and is only available from the
manufacturer if the patient is enrolled in a monitoring programme.
• Nerve conduction studies should be carried out as a baseline pretreatment, and at intervals on treatment.
• Women of child-bearing age must be formally counselled over the
risks and agree to take appropriate contraceptive measures. This must
be recorded in the notes.
• Lenalidomide (Revlimid®) is a derivative of thalidomide, introduced
for treatment of multiple myeloma and myelodysplastic syndromes.
It has direct anti-tumour effects (apotosis)—inhibition of the
microenvironment via anti-angiogenic and anti-osteoclastic activity.
• Pomalidomide is another derivative of thalidomide undergoing clinical
trials.
• Pentoxifylline was originally introduced for peripheral vascular disease.
It has similar but weaker actions to thalidomide in inhibiting TNFA
production. Clinical beneﬁt may be difﬁcult to discern, but it is nontoxic.

Immunosuppressive/
immunomodulatory drugs:
sulfasalazine and colchicine
Sulphasalazine
• Sulphasalazine was originally introduced as an antibiotic.
• It comprises sulphapyridine coupled to 5-aminosalicylic acid via a diazo
bond that can be split by enteric bacteria.
• Its precise mode of action as an immunomodulatory agent is uncertain.
• It has minor immunosuppressive activities, mainly localized to the gut,
but little effect on peripheral blood lymphocyte numbers or function.
• It is used predominantly in inﬂammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid
arthritis, and seronegative arthritides in doses of 500-2000mg/day in
divided doses.
• It has a signiﬁcant array of side effects including male infertility
(azoospermia), macrocytic anaemia, rash, Stevens-Johnson syndrome,
and secondary hypogammaglobulinaemia.
• Regular monitoring of FBC is required.

Colchicine
• Colchicine is a useful anti-inﬂammatory.
• Its precise immunological role is uncertain, but it inhibits microtubule
assembly and therefore inhibits mitosis.
• Concentrated in neutrophils and inhibits chemotactic activity, thus
reducing the accumulation of non-speciﬁc inﬂammatory cells.
• Valuable in Behçet’s syndrome and familial Mediterranean fever; may
be helpful in other autoinﬂammatory diseases.

IMMUNOSUPPRESSIVE/IMMUNOMODULATORY DRUGS

• Value is limited by side effects at therapeutic doses (diarrhoea and
gastrointestinal discomfort).
• Usual dose is up to 0.5mg four times daily, if tolerated.
• Grapefruit juice may increase toxicity.

Immunosuppressive/
immunomodulatory drugs: dapsone
• Used to treat dermatitis herpetiformis, urticarial vasculitis, and IgA
dermatoses.
• Inhibits B-integrin-mediated neutrophil adherence to endothelium by
binding to intracellular G-protein.
• Inhibits myeloperoxidase.
• Main side effect is haemolysis, which is marked in G6PD-deﬁcient
patients.
• Always check G6PD status prior to use and monitor FBC for signs
of haemolysis (reduced haptoglobins are a sensitive indicator of
haemolysis).
• Dose is usually 1-2mg/kg/day.

Immunosuppressive/
immunomodulatory drugs:
JAK3 inhibitors/tyrosine kinase
inhibitors
• Used to treat cancers and leukaemias, but also valuable for other
conditions such as hypereosinophilia.
• Imatinib (Glivec®) is the prototype and is active against the active form
of the oncogene Abl, a tyrosine kinase.
• Tofacitinib is speciﬁc JAK3 inhibitor which is being tested in
rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis.

Immunosuppressive/
immunomodulatory drugs:
bortezomib
• Bortezomib (Velcade®) is used to treat myeloma.
• It inhibits the catalytic site of the 26S proteasome, which may allow
apoptosis of the malignant myeloma cells.
• It increases the risk of shingles, and prophylactic aciclovir is advisable.
• It also causes neuropathy and myelosuppression.

CHAPTER 16

Immunotherapy

Immunosuppressive/
immunomodulatory biologicals:
high-dose IVIg
High-dose IVIg is widely used as an immunomodulatory agent in autoimmune diseases. Unfortunately, many of the uses have not been well supported by proper double-blind placebo-controlled trials and, in view of
the potential risks of infection (increased in response to volume exposure
in these groups (see ‘IVIg for replacement therapy 2’, p.392)), this cannot
be condoned. The precise mechanisms of action clinically are uncertain,
although many mechanisms have been postulated.

Actions
•
•
•
•
•
•

Fc-receptor blockade of phagocytic cells.
Inhibition of cytokine production.
Inactivation of pathogenic autoantibodies (anti-idiotypes).
Inhibition of autoantibody production by B cells.
Decreased T-cell proliferation.
Actions of soluble cytokines, cytokine receptors, and antagonists
present in IVIg.
• Inhibitory actions of stabilizing sugars.

Side effects
• Aseptic meningitis (elevated lymphocytes and protein in CSF)
?secondary to sugars.
• Renal failure (secondary to osmotic load from sugars).
• Massive intravascular haemolysis (secondary to IgG isoagglutinins).
• Hyperviscosity (CVAs, MI).
• Immune complex reactions in patients with high-titre rheumatoid
factors, cryoglobulins (types II and III), or other immune complex
disease (e.g. SLE).
• Anaphylactoid reactions (IgA deﬁciency, infected).

Main uses
• Replacement therapy for primary and secondary immunodeﬁciencies
(see ‘IVIg for replacement therapy 1’, p.392).
• Autoimmune cytopenias (ITP, AIHA).
• Vasculitis: Kawasaki syndrome, Wegener’s granulomatosis.
• Neurological diseases (acute Guillain-Barré, CIDP, pure motor
neuropathy, myasthenia gravis, LEMS, MS).
• Factor VIII and factor IX inhibitors.
• Anti-phospholipid antibodies in pregnancy.
• Autoimmune skin disease (pemphigus, pemphigoid, epidermolysis
bullosa acquisita).
• Eczema.
• Polymyositis, dermatomyositis.

IMMUNOSUPPRESSIVE/IMMUNOMODULATORY BIOLOGICALS

Dosage
• Dosage regimes range from 0.4g/kg/day for 5 days, through 1g/day for
2 days, to 2g/kg/day as a single dose.
• Minimal evidence is available to distinguish between the schedules.
• Fewer doses may be required for ITP.
• My own practice is to start all high-dose regimes on the 5-day schedule
to assess tolerability, and then increase to 1 g/kg/day for 2 days
subsequently.
• In adults and children, risks of renal impairment and aseptic meningitis
are highest with the ultra-rapid infusion schedule of 2g/kg/day, and I
avoid this if possible.
• Rapid infusions should be avoided in all elderly patients because of the
risks of hyperviscosity.
• Pre-treatment IgA deﬁciency and high-titre rheumatoid factors should
be excluded, and renal function assessed.
• Pre-treatment FBC, LFTs, and hepatitis serology (HBV, HCV) should
also be measured.
• IgA-deﬁcient patients require special care, and should be on products
low in IgA.
• If there is renal impairment to start with, creatinine should be
measured daily. If there is a rise of 10% or more, then therapy should
be discontinued.
• FBC should be repeated during the course to ensure that haemolysis
does not take place (haptoglobin is a sensitive indicator of intravascular
haemolysis).
• Infusion rates should follow manufacturers’ guidelines.
• There must be no switching of products.
2 Batch numbers must be recorded.

Immunosuppressive/
immunomodulatory biologicals:
polyclonal antibodies, high-dose
anti-D immunoglobulin, and blood
transfusion effect
Polyclonal antibodies
• Xenogeneic antisera raised by the immunization of animals with
puriﬁed human T cells or thymocytes (rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin
(ATG) and rabbit anti-lymphocyte globulin (ALG)) are potent
immunosuppressive agents.
• They cause a profound lymphopenia.
• They are difﬁcult to standardize and have signiﬁcant batch-to-batch
variation.

415

416

CHAPTER 16

Immunotherapy

• They also contain cross-reactive antibodies that react with other cells
types, including platelets.
• Utility is limited by the development of a host-anti-rabbit response,
which both neutralizes the xeno-antiserum and gives rise to a serum
sickness reaction.
Actions
• Complement-mediated lymphocyte destruction.
• Cause marked but variable lymphopenia.
• Reduced T-cell function.
Uses
• Acute graft rejection or GvHD.
• Diamond-Blackfan syndrome.
Dosage
• Dosage depends on batch but is usually within the range 5-30mg/kg/
day.
• The effect can be monitored by absolute lymphocyte counts or ﬂow
cytometric analysis of peripheral blood lymphocytes.

High-dose anti-D immunoglobulin
• High-dose anti-D immunoglobulin can be used to control autoimmune
haemolytic anaemia in rhesus D+ patients.
• Mechanism of action is unclear.

Blood transfusion effect
• In renal allografts it has been well documented that both donor and
random blood transfusions reduce the risks of graft rejection.
• The immunological mechanism is uncertain.

Immunosuppressive/
immunomodulatory biologicals:
anti-TNF agents
Since the second edition of this book there has been an explosion of

Rituximab (MabThera®)
• A humanized anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody. CD20 is strongly
expressed on normal and malignant B cells.
• Licensed for use in non-Hodgkin’s B-cell lymphomas.
• Can cause massive tumour lysis syndrome, with cytokine release
(antibody-complement mediated lysis) and capillary leak syndrome 1-2
hours after infusion.
• Fever and chills, nausea and vomiting, and hypersensitivity reactions

421

422

CHAPTER 16

Immunotherapy

Mepolizumab (Bosatria®)
• A humanized monoclonal antibody against IL-5.
• Shown to be useful in treatment of eosinophilic conditions including
asthma and possibly F1P1L1/PDGFRA negative hyper-eosinophilic
syndromes.

Omalizumab (Xolair®)
• A humanized monoclonal antibody against the IgE Fc region that
prevents binding to the high-afﬁnity IgE receptor (FceR1).
• FceR1 is downregulated on basophils and this provides a useful ﬂow
cytometric test for efﬁcacy.
• Now validated as a treatment for moderate to severe asthma.
• In the UK, severity is marked by repeated attendance at hospital,
penalizing those who have severe disease but self-manage at home.
• Local PCT approval for treatment is variable, giving rise to postcode
prescribing.
• It is being investigated as adjunctive therapy to desensitizing
immunotherapy.
• Dose is determined by serum total IgE, meaning that those with very
high IgE levels cannot be treated.
• It is administered subcutaneously every 2-4 weeks.
• Anaphylaxis to treatment has been reported.

Immunosuppressive/
immunomodulatory biologicals:
anti-integrin agents
• A number of agents have been produced against integrins. Those
against CD11/CD18 have all been disappointing and have been
associated with severe side effects. Efalizumab (anti-CD11a) was
introduced for psoriasis, but its licence has been withdrawn in the
USA because of concerns over the risk of progressive multifocal
leukoencephalopathy(PML).

Natalizumab (Tysabri®)
• A humanized monoclonal antibody against A4-integrin.
• Thought to work by preventing inﬂammatory cell migration,
particularly through the blood-brain barrier.
• Used for treatment of MS and Crohn’s disease.
• Associated with PML and was temporarily withdrawn from the market.
Cases of PML may be linked to combined therapy with other agents.

IMMUNOSUPPRESSIVE/IMMUNOMODULATORY BIOLOGICALS

Immunosuppressive/
immunomodulatory biologicals:
miscellaneous
Gemtuzumab (Mylotarg®)
• A monoclonal antibody against the CD33 antigen expressed on
myeloid leukaemic blasts and normal myeloid cells.
• Used to treat AML in ﬁrst relapse.

Trastuzumab
• A humanized antibody against the epidermal growth factor receptor
Her-2.
• Blocks and downregulates the receptor.
• Valuable in the treatment of metastatic breast cancer where the
tumour overexpresses Her-2.
• Her-2 is also expressed on other tumours.

Abciximab (ReoPro®)
• Monoclonal antibody binding to platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptors.
• Used once only as an adjunct to heparin and aspirin in high-risk
patients undergoing percutaneous transluminal coronary artery
interventions to prevent thrombotic complications.

Digoxin-speciﬁc antibody (Digibind®)
• Fab′ fragments of antibody against digoxin.
• Used to treat digoxin poisoning by binding to the drug.

although effects may be small.
• Also used to treat macular degeneration.

Eculizumab (Soliris®)
• Monoclonal humanized antibody binding to complement C5 and
preventing its activation by C5 convertase, thus preventing the
generation of the terminal lytic sequence.
• Licensed for the treatment of paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria
(in the UK, cases must be referred to supra-regional specialist service).
• Undergoing investigation as a drug for treatment of acute
complement-mediated graft rejection.
• Increases risk of meningococcal disease (as expected from primary
complement deﬁciency). Patients should be immunized with
quadrivalent conjugated meningococcal vaccine at least 2 weeks prior
to receiving drug. This will not provide protection against group B
meningococci.

423

424

CHAPTER 16

Immunotherapy

Total lymphoid irradiation (TLI)
• TLI is an experimental immunosuppressive therapy, having been used
previously for the treatment of lymphoid malignancies.
• Produces profound impairment of T-cell numbers and function,
although there is a small population of radio-resistant small
lymphocytes.
• A more modern variant is to use UV-sensitizing agents (psoralens)
and then irradiate leucocytes in an extracorporeal circulation
(photopheresis).
• TLI may be of beneﬁt in intractable RhA, multiple sclerosis, and severe
SLE.

Side effects
•
•
•
•

Severe leucopenia.
Thrombocytopenia.
Opportunist infections.
Lymphoma (NHL).

Photopheresis
• Extracorporeal phototherapy, using sensitizing agents, is used
for the treatment of graft-versus-host disease, inﬂammatory bowel
syndrome.
• 8-methoxypsoralen, which binds to lymphocyte DNA when activated,
is used as the sensitizer.

Thoracic duct drainage
• Has been used in the past for treatment of severe RhA.
• Causes a severe and long-lasting immunosuppression.
• Similar effects are seen from accidental thoracic duct damage in
oesophageal and cardiac surgery, where a chylous effusion is allowed
to drain unchecked.
• A profound and persistent lymphopenia of both T and B cells is
caused.
• Recovery of immune function may occur over a long period.
• Prophylaxis against Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia and fungal
infections will be required if the drainage is accidental.

IMMUNOADSORPTION

Plasmapheresis
• Plasmapheresis is the removal of plasma constituents using automated
cell separators. The plasma components are removed by either
centrifugation or membrane ﬁltration.
• Erythrocytes and other cellular components are re-infused and the
removed plasma replaced with either FFP or FFP + IVIg to maintain
circulating volume.
• About 50% of the plasma is removed each time.
• A therapeutic course is usually 3-5 daily treatments.
• The amount of antibody removed depends on volume of distribution.
• 90% of IgM but only 20% of IgG is removed each time as only 40%
of the IgG is within the vascular space.
• Plasmapheresis also has the advantage of removing immune complexes
and small mediators (toxins, anaphylotoxins, cytokines etc.), in addition
to the antibodies.
• Plasmapheresis is only suitable for urgent therapy, as antibody
levels return rapidly and frequently overshoot to higher levels after
plasmapheresis is discontinued.
• It is important to commence conventional immunosuppression at
the same time.

Side effects
• Leakage/air embolism.
• Anticoagulation (citrate toxicity)/thrombocytopenia.
• Reactions to replacement ﬂuids.

Uses
•
•
•
•
•
•

Hyperviscosity (Waldenström’s macroglobulinaemia, IgA myeloma).
Goodpasture’s syndrome/Wegener’s granulomatosis.
Cryoglobulinaemia.
Myasthenia gravis.
Guillain-Barré syndrome (but IVIg is as good).
It has been tried in other autoimmune diseases (RhA, factor VIII
antibodies, MS, lupus nephritis) with variable anecdotal success.
• A limiting factor in its use is access to appropriate equipment.

Immunoadsorption
• Selective removal of autoantibodies has been attempted using an
extracorporeal circuit including a column of inert beads coated with
protein A or protein G for speciﬁc adsorption of IgG.
• This treatment is experimental and it is not widely used in clinical
practice.

425

426

CHAPTER 16

Immunotherapy

Allergy interventions: drugs
Treatment for allergic disease is divided into three major target areas:
mast cells, released mediators, and the speciﬁc immune response.
Treatment can be topical or systemic: topical is preferred if this is effective. The underlying chronic inﬂammatory component, especially of asthma,
always needs to be addressed rather than just using symptomatic agents.
Corticosteroids and antihistamines are more effective as prophylactic
agents, taken before allergen exposure.

Mast-cell active drugs
• Corticosteroids (interfere with synthesis of leukotrienes).
• Mast-cell stabilization: cromoglicate/nedocromil/ketotifen (prevent
allergen-triggered calcium ﬂux and hence prevent degranulation).

Released mediators
• B-agonists (smooth muscle relaxation, ?some anti-inﬂammatory effect
(salmeterol)).
• Antihistamines: use long-acting high-potency non-sedating drugs
without cardiotoxicity (loratadine, desloratadine, levocetirizine,
cetirizine, fexofenadine).
• Corticosteroids.
• Anti-PAF drugs (clinical results disappointing).
• Leukotriene (LTD4) antagonists: montelukast, zaﬁrlukast (useful
adjunctive treatment in asthma).
• 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor: zileuton (asthma).
• Kinin antagonists: icatibant (anti-bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist),
WIN64338, FR173657 (orally active B2 antagonist).

Speciﬁc IgE
•
•
•
•

Desensitization.
Peptide therapy (experimental).
Anti-FcRε therapy (experimental).
Omalizumab, anti-IgE (see p.422).

Allergy interventions: desensitization
(immunotherapy)
Mechanism of beneﬁt
• Mechanism of desensitization is uncertain: speciﬁc IgE may rise in early
stages of treatment, and then fall.
• The role of ‘blocking antibodies’ (IgG4) is unknown.
• One hypothesis suggests that sequential exposure gradually switches
the CD4+ T-cell response from Th2 to Th1, reducing IgE production
and the levels of the pro-allergic cytokines IL-4 and IL-5.

ALLERGY INTERVENTIONS: DESENSITIZATION (IMMUNOTHERAPY)

Indications
• Desensitization should be considered for patients with:
• anaphylaxis to insect venoms
• rhinoconjunctivitis not controlled with maximal medical therapy,
used correctly, and including repeated courses of oral steroids
• asthma may be amenable to treatment but carries high risks
• anaphylaxis to venoms.
• In the UK, most vaccines are available only on a named-patient basis.

Exclusions
• Current UK guidelines suggest that desensitization is inappropriate for
those with the following:
• multiple allergies
• severe asthma (FEV1 <75% predicted)—seasonal wheeze only
induced by pollen is not a contraindication to desensitization out of
the pollen season
• heart disease
• hypertension requiring B-blockade (difﬁcult to resuscitate in
emergencies!)
• use of ACE inhibitors (increased risk of angioedema, local and
systemic)
• during pregnancy
• excess alcohol consumption (increased risk of side effects).
• Age >50 years is associated with poor responses (exception is venom
immunotherapy).

Schedules
• Traditional desensitization is done with weekly injections of increasing
doses of aqueous allergen until maintenance doses are reached at
14-18 weeks.
• Once on maintenance doses, intervals between injections are spaced
out to 4-6 weeks for 3 years.
• Short course (4 or 6 injections over the winter) of adsorbed allergens
(Pollinex® and Pollinex Quattro®) are as effective for pollen allergies.
Course is repeated annually for 3 years.
• Allergens available in the UK include the following.
• Venoms: bee, wasp, bumblebee (for market gardeners who use
bumblebees for pollination!).
• Pollens: grass, birch pollen, ragweed (USA mainly).
• Animals: cat (potent allergen associated with high incidence of side
effects), horse, dog (but this is not as effective as the others).
• House dust mite.
• Highly puriﬁed allergens should always be used: whole-insect extracts
or multiple allergen combinations are not recommended in the UK.
• All except Pollinex® are unlicensed at present and therefore are
administered on a named-patient basis:
• formal written consent is required.

427

428

CHAPTER 16

Immunotherapy

• Precise protocol and total duration of therapy varies depending on the
allergen.
• All require long-term commitment from patients.
• Schedules are onerous and the leeway for changes to
accommodate holidays is minimal.
• Patients must not undertake vigorous exercise after injections
(increased risk of side effects).
• Injections should not be given if patient is unwell.
• Pre-treatment with antihistamines reduces risk of local reactions.
• Peak ﬂow should be monitored before and 30 minutes after injection.
• All patients must stay for at least 1 hour post-injection (no
exceptions).
• Rush and ultra-rush schedules have been devised for venom allergy,
but are rarely required in practice and signiﬁcantly increase the risks of
reactions.
0 Desensitization must be carried out in hospital, and staff must be conversant with emergency management of anaphylaxis and cardiac arrest
procedures.

Side effects
• Main side effects are pain and swelling at site of injections (pre-treat
with antihistamine and supply oral steroid).
• Systemic reactions may occur (cough is often the ﬁrst sign): treat as
for any acute allergic reaction.
• Risk of reactions is increased:
• during the up-dosing period (aqueous allergens)
• in patients treated with cat allergen
• if patient has intercurrent infection (defer injection)
• if patient is extremely anxious (use sedation if necessary)
• if patient is exposed to allergen naturally during the up-dosing
period;
• if patient is drinking excess alcohol
• if patient is started on an ACE inhibitor.

Sublingual therapy
• Sublingual desensitization is widely practised in Europe but its use is
limited in the UK.
• Allergen drops or tablets are placed under the tongue on a daily basis.
• Local tingling and minor swelling may occur.
• Experience from Europe suggests that this is safe and effective, and can
be administered at home.
• Grazax®, a sublingual tablet for grass pollen allergy, is licensed in the
UK, but treatment should be initiated and supervised by a trained
allergist/immunologist. Shellﬁsh allergy is a contraindication due to the
nature of the coating on the tablet.
• 3 years treatment is still required.
• First dose of sublingual treatment should be administered in hospital.
Thereafter, self-treatment at home is appropriate.

ADOPTIVE IMMUNOTHERAPY

Adoptive immunotherapy
Stem cell transplantation
See Chapter 15.

Interleukin-2 and LAK therapy
• LAK therapy (lymphokine-activated killer cells) has been proposed as a
treatment for malignant disease.
• Peripheral blood lymphocytes are harvested and then stimulated in
vitro with high-dose IL-2 and re-infused into the patient with additional
IL-2.
• Side effects are severe and tumoricidal activity is limited.
• A better approach may be to expand tumour-invading lymphocytes
(TIL).
• The therapy is moderately toxic in therapeutic doses (ﬂuid retention,
capillary leak syndrome).
• There is some evidence of beneﬁt in melanoma and renal cell
carcinoma (salvage therapy).

CHAPTER 17

Immunochemistry

Techniques
Electrophoresis, immunoelectrophoresis, immunoﬁxation,
isoelectric focusing, and immunoblotting
Serum electrophoresis
The most basic technique for the detection of serum proteins.
• Serum is applied to an electrolyte containing agarose gel and a current
is applied across the gel. Proteins are separated largely on the basis of
their surface charge.
• Separated proteins are then visualized by incubating the gel with a
protein-binding dye. As the amount of dye bound is proportional
to the protein present, the amount of protein present in each band
can be calculated from the absorbance of the dye if the total protein
concentration is known. This is the method used for paraprotein
quantitation.
• Faster semi-automated systems use capillary zone electrophoresis
(CZE).
Immunoelectrophoresis/immunoﬁxation
Techniques for identifying the nature of the proteins separated in an electrophoretic strip.
• Individual proteins can be identiﬁed by immunoelectrophoresis, in
which troughs cut parallel to the electrophoretic strip are ﬁlled with
antisera, which are allowed to diffuse towards the separated proteins.
• Reaction at the point of equivalence gives an arc of precipitation.
• A faster technique is immunoﬁxation, in which the antisera are laid
over the electrophoretic separation and unreacted proteins washed
out before staining with a protein-binding dye.
• Both these techniques are used principally to identify monoclonal
immunoglobulins. Serum is preferred as the mobility of ﬁbrinogen is
such that it runs in the same region as some immunoglobulins.
• CZE can also be adapted to immunoﬁxation.
Isoelectric focusing and immunoblotting
More sensitive techniques are required for CSF, as the concentrations of
immunoglobulins are lower.
• Electrophoretic separation is carried out by isoelectric focusing. The
gel contains ampholytes, which move under the current to set up a pH
gradient across the gel.
• Proteins applied subsequently then move to the part of the gel where
the pH ensures that they become electrically neutral. They then cease
to move in the current.
• The gel is blotted on to nitrocellulose ﬁlters, which are reacted with
antisera against immunoglobulins (immunoblotting).

Radial immunodiffusion (RID)
A simple, although slow, method for the measurement of any protein for
which an antiserum exists.
• Antiserum is incorporated into an agar gel, which is poured onto a
plate and allowed to set. Regular holes are then cut into the gel and

TECHNIQUES

the serum containing the protein of interest is placed in the holes. The
serum diffuses into the gel and forms an immunoprecipitate that can
be seen as a white halo around the well.
• The log[concentration] is proportional to the diameter of the ring. The
ring diameter can be measured using an eyepiece graticule.
• If this method is used to measure concentrations of immunoglobulins,
caution is required as variations in molecular weight (e.g. if serum
contains monomeric rather than polymeric IgM, as may happen in
Waldenström’s macroglobulinaemia) or the presence of immune
complexes may cause falsely low or falsely high values.
• IgA-deﬁcient individuals often have antibodies to ruminant proteins,
including immunoglobulins, and as the antisera that are incorporated
in the gel are often raised in ruminants, this may cause reverse
precipitation in the gel and lead to entirely spurious results.

Ouchterlony double diffusion
A technique used for non-quantitative identiﬁcation of proteins.
• Wells are cut in agar, and test serum and antisera are placed in the
wells and allowed to diffuse towards each other.
• Lines of precipitation will form, which can be seen using a light box.
When multiple samples are tested, lines of identity and partial identity
can be recorded between sample wells.
• The technique is sensitive and can be used for low-level IgA
detection.
• A variant in which the antigen and antibody are forced together by
application of a current speeds the process up, but depends on the
electrophoretic mobility of the antibodies and antigens. It is used
for detection of antibodies to ENA (see Chapter 18)—this is called
countercurrent immunoelectrophoresis.

Nephelometry and turbidimetry
These techniques are the mainstay of automated speciﬁc protein
measurement.
• As with other techniques, they rely on immune complex formation
when antibodies and antigens react. This alters the optical
properties of the solution, and the light absorbance or scatter
can be measured.
• The reactions can be enhanced using reaction diluents containing
polyethylene glycol (PEG), which stabilizes the immune complex.
• Accuracy can be enhanced using kinetic assays (rate nephelometry).
• This technique is suitable for automation, but depends on high-grade
monospeciﬁc antisera of high potency. Monoclonal antibodies are
rarely suitable for this type of system.
• Anything that causes the serum to be turbid before the reaction
begins, or interferes with the optical properties of the solution, will
cause difﬁculties. This includes lipaemic sera or haemolysed samples
with excess free haemoglobin (with haemoglobin-haptoglobin
complexes).

CHAPTER 17

Immunochemistry

α1-acid glycoprotein
• Units: g/L.
• Normal range:
• male, 0.6-1.2g/L
• female, 0.4-1.0g/L.

Principles of test
• Measured by nephelometry/turbidimetry.

Indications for testing
• Also known as orosomucoid, an acute-phase protein, induced by IL-1,
IL-6, and TNFA.
• It used to be used extensively in the diagnosis and monitoring of
inﬂammatory bowel disease, and it was felt that it was more speciﬁc
for this category of disease. There is no strong evidence to support
this assertion and CRP probably provides all the information required.
• Dynamic range is only twofold, compared with >100-fold for CRP.
• There is a sex difference, with levels in females being lower. Levels are
also reduced in pregnancy and in patients receiving oestrogens.
• It is known to bind certain drugs such as propranolol.
• There are no routine indications for its regular measurement at
present.

α1-antichymotrypsin
• Units: g/L.
• Normal adult range: 0.3-0.6g/L.

Principles of test
• Measured by nephelometry/turbidimetry.

Indications for testing
• This protein is one of the SERPIN family (serine protease inhibitors)
whose major role is the protection of tissues from proteolysis by
neutrophil and macrophage enzymes. It is particularly active against
cathepsin G.
• It rises rapidly during an acute-phase response (within 8 hours) and has
a dynamic range of ﬁvefold (much less than CRP). It remains elevated
for longer.
• It has been suggested as a useful marker for inﬂammatory bowel
disease, but there is little evidence to support this and it is not widely
used.

A1-ANTITRYPSIN (A1-AT)

α1-antitrypsin (α1-AT)
• Units: g/L.
• Normal adult range: 1.0-1.9g/L.

Principles of test
• A1-AT is measured by nephelometry/turbidimetry.

Indications for testing
• A1-AT is a proteolytic inhibitor with a wide range of inhibitory
activities. It is a member of the SERPIN family.
• Low levels are associated with cirrhosis, emphysema, and neonatal
jaundice, and also with adult liver disease. Deﬁciency may also
be associated with vasculitis (particularly of the skin) and with
membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis.
• There are a number of deﬁciency alleles, and when a low value is
detected the phenotype should be determined. Other members of the
family should be screened and phenotyped. This represents the only
clinical utility of A1-AT measurements.

Interpretation
• A1-AT comprises the major part of the A1 fraction on serum
electrophoresis, and deﬁciency can be detected readily on an
electrophoretic strip.
• Occasionally split A1 bands due to allelic variants of A1-AT with
different mobilities may be noted.
• In conditions where there are high levels of circulating proteases,
protease-A1-AT complexes may form, with loss of the A1 band. The
complex moves in the A2-B region of the electrophoretic strip.
• High levels are seen as part of the acute-phase response, particularly in
chronic infections (bronchiectasis).
• Levels are also increased in pregnancy, in patients on oestrogens,
and in certain malignant diseases, including some germ-cell tumours.
However, it is not useful clinically in any of these situations.
• It has been suggested that measurement of A1-AT in faeces may
give information on gut protein loss as it is resistant to degradation,
although there appears to be a high false-negative rate. It may be a
useful alternative to radio-isotopic methods for proving the presence
of a protein-losing enteropathy. Normal levels are <5mg/g dry weight
of faeces.

437

438

CHAPTER 17

Immunochemistry

α1-antitrypsin (α1-AT) genotype
(PI typing)
• The gene for A1-AT is located on chromosome 14, close to the
immunoglobulin heavy-chain locus (PI gene system, for protease
inhibitor). A large number of variant alleles have been described.
• The identiﬁcation is usually undertaken by isoelectric focusing, but
functional studies may also be required for some rare alleles.
• In the UK, deﬁciency alleles occur with an incidence of about 1
in 2000. Many variants are seen in other racial groups and, as a
consequence, are found only exceedingly rarely in the UK.
• The important deﬁciency alleles are S, P, W, Z, Mmalton, and null (no
expressed A1-AT). Homozygosity for one or heterozygosity for any two
of these alleles leads to severe deﬁciency. Heterozygosity with any nondeﬁciency allele leads to a reduction in, but not absence of, A1-AT.
• The allele Mduarte gives rise to a functional deﬁciency with normal
antigenic concentrations.
• Studies should always be undertaken on family members, and referring
clinicians should always be asked for a family tree.
• Antenatal diagnosis is also possible by PI typing a fetal blood sample.
• In the UK, PI typing is undertaken by the Protein Reference Units
(PRUs) in Birmingham and Shefﬁeld, and their excellent handbook
gives more detail on the genetic system (see Introduction, ‘Useful
handbooks’ p.xxvii for details).

α2-macroglobulin
• Units: g/L.
• Normal ranges (quoted by PRU):
• <15 years. 2.8-6.7g/L
• >15 years, 1.3-2.0 -3.5-5.0g/L depending on age and sex.

Indications for testing
• No value in routine measurement at present.

Interpretation
• A2MG has anti-protease activity. It is an acute-phase protein and also
acts as the carrier for IL-6.
• In adults, levels are slightly lower in females and fall with age.
• It is a major component of the A2 band on electrophoresis and
contributes signiﬁcantly to the elevation of A2 seen in chronic
inﬂammatory conditions.
• As it has a very high molecular weight (725kDa), this protein is
preferentially retained in the nephrotic syndrome, giving a relative
increase in relation to other areas of the electrophoretic strip.
• Levels are also reported to be elevated in ataxia telangiectasia,
diabetes mellitus, oestrogen therapy, and pregnancy.
• Reduced levels have been found in pre-eclampsia and acute
pancreatitis. Deﬁciency has been reported but is exceptionally rare.

ACUTE-PHASE PROTEINS (CRP, ESR, SAA)

Acute-phase proteins (CRP, ESR, SAA)
• Units:
• CRP, mg/L
• ESR, mm/h
• SAA, mg/L.
• Normal ranges:
• CRP, 0-6mg/L
• ESR, 0-25mm/h
• SAA, 0-10mg/L.

Principles of test
• As serum proteins, C-reactive protein (CRP) and serum amyloid
A (SAA) are amenable to measurement by nephelometry or
turbidimetry.
• Measurement of the ESR is by timing the rate of fall of erythrocytes in
a graduated tube.

Indications for testing
• Acute and chronic infections, vasculitis, connective tissue disease,
arthritis, autoinﬂammatory diseases.

Interpretation
• CRP is a member of the pentraxin family of proteins.
• CRP is a bacterial opsonin and binds free DNA.
• Clinicians are usually confused by ESR and CRP—they do not give the
same information and should be used together.
• ESR is largely dependent on elevation of ﬁbrinogen, a long-lived serum
acute-phase protein, and of serum macroglobulins (A2MG, IgM). It is
also affected by red cell morphology.
• CRP is like blood glucose, while ESR is like HbA1c!
• CRP rises within hours of onset of inﬂammation/infection and falls
quickly once treatment is instituted. Half-life is 6-8 hours. Therefore it
is useful for rapid diagnosis and for monitoring response (Table 17.1)
• The ESR rises slowly, as it is dependent in part on ﬁbrinogen, a longlived protein, and falls equally slowly. The half-life of ﬁbrinogen is
approximately a week.
• In active SLE, the ESR is high, but the CRP is not elevated.
• CRP is driven by IL-6, as well as IL-1 and TNFA, and may be elevated
in myeloma. Measurements of CRP reﬂect serum IL-6 levels and there
is no additional value to measuring IL-6 directly.
• Levels in very young children may be much lower for a given stimulus.
• A very small number of patients do not make inﬂammatory responses
which exceed the normal range, but seem to run on a lower ‘normal’
range (10-fold less). Ultrasensitive assays for low-level CRP are
available.
• Some patients with giant cell arteritis never show an ‘elevated’ CRP.

• SAA, which is the circulating precursor of the secondary (AA) type of
amyloid and whose physiological function is currently unknown, is an
acute-phase protein with a very wide dynamic range (1000-fold).
• Monitoring of SAA is said to be valuable in disease known to
predispose to the development of AA amyloid, such as chronic
infections and inﬂammation, particularly autoinﬂammatory syndromes.
The CRP test is more widely available and probably gives the same
information.
• In allograft rejection, CRP and SAA may move independently.
• Serum amyloid P (SAP) is related to CRP structurally and is a member
of the pentraxin family. Despite this similarity, its function is not fully
understood and it does not function as a major acute-phase protein.
Routine measurement is not justiﬁed at present, although labelled SAP
has been used as a tracer for amyloid deposits.

AMYLOID PROTEINS

Amyloid proteins
• Amyloid refers to the deposition of altered proteins in tissues in an
insoluble form.
• The precursor protein varies according to the cause, and can often be
measured speciﬁcally (Table 17.2).
• Amyloid is usually conﬁrmed by special stains on histological
examination of biopsies.
• Measurement of serum immunoglobulins and electrophoresis, serum
free light chains, B2-microglobulin, and CRP is essential if amyloid is
suspected.

CHAPTER 17

Immunochemistry

Avian precipitins
• Units: reported semi-quantitatively.
• Normal range: healthy adults exposed regularly to birds may
demonstrate precipitins.

Principles of test
• Usually carried out by double diffusion. Fluorescence assays and ELISA
are also used, and Pharmacia have an ImmunoCAP® available.

Indications for testing
• Used in the investigation of bird-fancier’s lung (extrinsic allergic
alveolitis).

Interpretation
• IgG-precipitating antibodies to avian antigens are found in cases of
bird-fancier’s lung. These react particularly with avian serum and faecal
proteins.
• Presence of precipitins is a marker of exposure and does not
automatically mean that disease will be present.
• Presence of multiple precipitin lines tends to be a feature of disease.
• Any bird species is capable of inducing precipitins, but the most
common causes of problems are pigeons (in pigeon breeders),
psittacine cage birds, and domestic poultry (as an occupational
disease).

Bacterial and viral antibodies (speciﬁc
antibodies; functional antibodies)
• Units are variable: U/L, IU/mL, μg/mL.
• Ranges are variable: check with reporting laboratory.
• Pneumococcal antibodies, >20U/L (asplenics >35U/L).
• Tetanus antibodies: >0.1IU/mL (minimum protective level)
• Haemophilus inﬂuenzae type B, >1.0μg/mL (full protection, asplenics
>1.5μg/mL).
• Viral antibodies: usually qualitatative, semi-quantitative, or titre.

Principles of test
• Measurement of antibody production against deﬁned pathogens
or antigens puriﬁed from pathogens plays an important role in the
investigation of suspected immunodeﬁciency.
• Most assays are carried out by enzyme-linked immunoassay, but
some viral antibodies are still measured by haemagglutination or
complement ﬁxation.
• Pre- and post-immunization samples should be run together for direct
comparison as the coefﬁcients of variation for the assays tend to be
high (15-25%!).

BACTERIAL AND VIRAL ANTIBODIES

• An EQA scheme exists for tetanus, pneumococcal, and Hib antibodies,
and internationally agreed standards are available for tetanus and Hib.
A UK standard exists for pneumococcal antibodies.
• Post-immunization samples should be taken at 3-4 weeks to see the
optimum response.
• Assays have tended to focus on agents for which there are safe and
effective vaccines.
• 1 Live vaccines should never be given to any patient in whom
immunodeﬁciency is suspected.
• Antibodies normally run in immunology laboratories include
pneumococcal polysaccharides, which may be further differentiated as
IgG1 and IgG2, Haemophilus inﬂuenzae type B (Hib), and tetanus.
• Assays to individual serotypes of Pneumococcus are available in
reference laboratories. This is a time-consuming and expensive test
and should only be used by experienced immunologists investigating
suspected immune failure.
• Diphtheria antibodies are not run by many laboratories as the assay’s
EQA performance has been so poor.
• Antibodies to Pseudomonas and Burkholderia are used in cystic ﬁbrosis.
• Antibodies to Salmonella Vi antigens are being studied as a potential
for evaluating immune response to polysaccharide antigens (alternive
to pneumococcal antibodies).
• Meningococcal C polysaccharide antibodies are run by a few
specialized laboratories, but correspondence with known clinical status
has been poor and there is no EQA.
• ASOT may be helpful. However, antibodies to staphylolysin are not
useful, as they may be negative in normal individuals.
• Viral antibodies may be valuable—to natural exposure and
immunization antigens such as polio, measles, mumps, rubella,
chickenpox, EBV, and hepatitis B (if immunized).
• Isohaemagglutinins are naturally occurring IgM antibodies (in patients
of a suitable blood group) and should be measured as part of a
functional antibody screen.

Indications for testing
• These assays should be used in the work-up of patients with suspected
immunodeﬁciency, or in monitoring change in such patients.
• Anti-Pseudomonas/Burkholderia antibodies are used for monitoring CF
patients in some centres.
• Responsiveness to immunization is a helpful marker of immunological
recovery following bone marrow transplant.
• Annual monitoring of levels may be valuable in asplenic patients, as
such patients lose immunity more rapidly than a eusplenic population.

Interpretation
• Interpretation is entirely dependent on the context!
• Assays for pneumococcal polysaccharides measure a composite of
responses to the 23 strains in the Pneumovax II® vaccine. This can be
misleading as not all strains represented in the vaccine are equipotent

443

as immunostimulators. This means that a ‘normal’ response may
actually mean a good response to the immunogenic strains, masking
failure of response to the less immunogenic strains.
Evaluation of the response to conjugated pneumococcal vaccines and
the measurement of serotype-speciﬁc responses may be helpful.
Therefore evaluation of such patients should be carried out by an
immunologist with an interest in immunodeﬁciency. More weight
should be placed on changes in response to immunization than to
actual values—hence the need to run pre- and post-immunization
samples together.
A ‘normal’ response to immunization has never been standardized.
Publications frequently use different criteria, rendering comparison
impossible. The following is a useful working deﬁnition:
2 a fourfold rise in titre that rises to well within the normal range.
All antibody responses must be interpreted in the light of the clinical
history and previous infections/immunizations.
Some patients lose speciﬁc antibody rapidly, within 3-6 months of
immunizations (i.e. poor long-term immunological memory). If this is
suspected, repeat testing after 6 months.
Measured responses if conjugated pneumococcal vaccines (Prevenar®),
which contain fewer serotypes, are used may be lower if the laboratory
uses assays based on Pneumovax II® as the test antigen mix.

Bence-Jones proteins
See ‘Urine electrophoresis and immunoﬁxation’, p.470, and ‘Urine free
light chains’, p.470.

β2-microglobulin (β2MG)
• Units: mg/L.
• Normal range: 1-3mg/L.

Principles of test
• Test measures free B2-microglobulin, which normally forms the light
chain of HLA class I molecules but is shed when there is increased
lymphocyte turnover and therefore is present in serum in soluble
form. It is usually rapidly cleared by the kidneys.
• It has a molecular weight of 11-12kDa.
• Measurement is usually by automated analyser, nephelometry, or
turbidimetry.
• RID is still used, but it is slow.

Indications for testing
• The main indication is as part of the routine monitoring of patients
with myeloma, lymphoma, and HIV. However, its non-speciﬁc nature
and the inﬂuence of renal function on results mean that it is less widely
used.

CAERULOPLASMIN

• Serum free light chains are replacing B2MG in the monitoring of
myeloma.
• Elevated levels can be seen in dialysis patients.

Interpretation
Levels are elevated in the following.
• HIV infection (surrogate marker of progression).
• In HIV disease, B2MG is said to be a useful surrogate predictor of
disease progression, and gives similar information to the absolute
CD4+ T-cell count. However, the dynamic range in HIV is small
compared with that in lymphoproliferative diseases. The CD4+
T-cell count and viral load are preferred in the UK.
• Other viral infections.
• Myeloma (marker of tumour mass).
• In myeloma, serial measurement of B2MG is a useful adjunct
in terms of monitoring tumour burden and cell turnover.
Interpretation of levels is complicated by the need to consider
renal function, particularly as free light chains are nephrotoxic and
may damage tubules, thus inhibiting reabsorption, and there may
also be glomerular damage preventing ﬁltration. Therefore the
effects on B2MG serum levels in myeloma are complex.
• Levels below 4mg/L are associated with a good prognosis, while
levels above 20mg/L are associated with a poor prognosis, although
this may well represent the effects of renal damage.
• Treatment with A-interferon elevates serum levels, which needs to
be considered in monitoring levels.
• Lymphoma.
• Common variable immunodeﬁciency (correlation with severity): it
appears most highly correlated with granulomatous disease.
• Renal dialysis (depending on type of membrane): very high levels may
be associated with amyloid.
• High levels may also be seen in renal tubular dysfunction, such as
damage from aminoglycoside drugs.
• Allograft rejection (beware of intercurrent viral infections): levels will
fall with treatment.
• Elevated levels of B2MG are seen in connective tissue diseases such
as Sjögren’s syndrome and rheumatoid arthritis, and in granulomatous
diseases such as sarcoidosis. Levels fall when patients are treated with
corticosteroids or other lymphocytotoxic chemotherapy.
Measurement of urinary B2MG is of no value as it is rapidly degraded in
urine.

Caeruloplasmin
• Units: g/L.
• Normal adult range: 0.19-0.71g/L.

Principles of test
• Caeruloplasmin is measured by nephelometry.

445

446

CHAPTER 17

Immunochemistry

Indications for testing
• Clinically, the most important indication for measurement is in
suspected Wilson’s disease.
• It has been proposed as a useful marker in the monitoring of vasculitis,
although it is doubtful whether it gives any additional information over
measurement of CRP (it is the cause of green serum in vasculitis!).

Interpretation
• Caeruloplasmin is a copper-binding protein, of molecular weight
150kDa, with an A2 mobility on electrophoresis.
• Levels are reduced in most cases of Wilson’s disease (hepatolenticular
degeneration), although a few patients will have normal values, usually
when there is an intercurrent stimulus to the acute-phase response.
• As it is synthesized in the liver, levels will be reduced in severe liver
disease (hepatitis and primary biliary cirrhosis).
• Levels are reduced in severe malabsorptive syndromes where there is
copper deﬁciency.
• Levels will be elevated in acute-phase responses, in particular in
rheumatoid arthritis and vasculitis, and in pregnancy, oral contraceptive
use, and thyrotoxicosis.

Complement C3, C4, and factor B
• Units: g/L or mg/L.
• Normal ranges:
• complement C3, 0.68-1.80g/L
• complement C4, 0.18-0.60g/L
• factor B, 180-240mg/L (rarely measured routinely).

Principles of test
• C3, C4, and factor B are usually measured by rate nephelometry or
turbidimetry.
• Care needs to be taken with samples as venepuncture and
transportation may lead to in vitro activation, which may reduce levels
of C3, and especially C4, and lead to spurious increases in breakdown
products. This may be prevented by taking samples into EDTA, as
breakdown is calcium dependent.

Indications for testing (see Table 17.3)
• Valuable in:
• suspected SLE (C3, C4, C3d)
• suspected complement deﬁciency (C3, C4, haemolytic complement)
• suspected anaphylaxis (anaphylotoxins C4a, C5a)
• suspected hereditary angioedema (C3, C4, C1q, C1 esterase
inhibitor, immunochemical and functional)
• monitoring SLE and immune complex disease (SBE, serum sickness).
• Measurement of all three components allows analysis of both classical
and alternate pathway activation; factor B is not usually measured
routinely.

Interpretation
• Complement deﬁciency is common (especially C4 and C2 deﬁciency);
predisposes to recurrent neisserial disease, bacterial infections (C3
deﬁciency), and immune complex disease (lupus-like).
• Measurement of C3 is valuable in monitoring SLE. C4 null alleles are
common and affect the baseline level of C4. It is not possible to use
C4 levels as a marker of activity in SLE without knowing how many
null alleles there are.
• It is useful in the diagnosis of SBE (reduced C3), post-streptococcal
glomerulonephritis (low C3), and other conditions of complement
activation.
• A persistently low C3 may indicate the presence of a C3-nephritic
factor (see Chapter 18).
• In patients with angioedema, a low C4 may indicate C1-esterase
inhibitor deﬁciency.
• Both C3 and C4 are acute-phase proteins, and therefore may be
normal even at times of rapid consumption. Assessment of C3
breakdown products is advised.
• C4 is often reduced in pre-eclampsia.

Complement allotypes
The locations for the complement genes are known. C2, factor B, C4A,
and C4B form part of the MHC genes (Class III) encoded on chromosome
6, linked to HLA-DR. C3 is encoded by an autosomal co-dominant system
on chromosome 19. Null alleles are common, particularly for C2 and C4.
Determination of the complement allotypes is sometimes undertaken as
part of extended MHC phenotyping/genotyping when looking at disease
association and speciﬁcally at complement deﬁciency states. It may also
be used as an additional testing during tissue typing. C4 null alleles confer
an increased risk of developing SLE and also drug-induced lupus. They
have also been associated with systemic sclerosis, RhA, common variable
immunodeﬁciency, and selective IgA deﬁciency. Complement allotypes
are available through the PRUs—see Handbook of clinical immunochemistry
for further details of sample requirements and indications.

CHAPTER 17

Immunochemistry

CH100/APCH100 (haemolytic complement;
lytic complement function tests)
• Units: can be reported in arbitrary units or percentage of normal
plasma, but better reported as ‘normal’, ‘reduced’, or ‘absent’.
• Normal range: present (80-120% of reference plasma).

Principles of test
• Haemolytic complement assays screen for the integrity of the classical/
alternate pathways and the terminal lytic sequence, and use either
antibody-coated sheep cells (CH100, classical pathway) or guinea pig
red cells (APCH100, alternate pathway). Either a gel or liquid assay can
be used, but the gel is easier! If a liquid-based assay is performed the
results are reported at the point of 50% lysis (CH50, APCH50). Both
CH100 and APCH100 must be performed in parallel.
• In both types of assay the classical pathway activity is detected by using
antibody-coated sheep red cells, while guinea pig red cells are used for
the alternate pathway, as these are susceptible to direct lysis via the
alternate pathway.
• Both assays are dependent on the terminal lytic sequence.
• Activity can be reported in terms of units/mL or compared with a
standard serum and reported as a percentage. However, it is probably
adequate to report as ‘normal’, ‘low’, or ‘absent’.

Indications for testing
• Any patient in whom deﬁciency of a complement component is suspected.
• Any patient with recurrent neisserial disease or infection with an
unusual strain of Neisseria.

Interpretation
• Reduced levels of haemolytic activity will be seen during infections and
immune complex diseases such as serum sickness and SLE.
• Testing for absence of a component needs to be undertaken at a
minimum of 4-6 weeks after recovery from infection.
• Absence in both CH100 and APCH100 indicates a deﬁciency in the
terminal lytic sequence C5-C9 (C9 deﬁciency will give slow lysis).
• Absence in CH100 indicates a missing component in the classical
pathway C1-C4.
• Absence in APCH100 indicates deﬁciency in the alternate pathway
(factor D, factor B, C3).
• Follow-up testing to identify a missing component must be undertaken
if there is absence of activity in one or both assays.
• Serial monitoring of haemolytic complement activity has been used
to monitor disease activity in SLE, but is not a reliable or accurate
measure. C3 breakdown products are better, if available.
0 Critical action Anyone who has a single episode of neisserial meningitis with an unusual strain or a second episode must be assumed to have
complement deﬁciency until proved otherwise. Investigation of haemolytic complement after recovery is mandatory.

C1-ESTERASE INHIBITOR (IMMUNOCHEMICAL AND FUNCTIONAL)

C1-esterase inhibitor (immunochemical
and functional)
• Units:
• immunochemical, g/L
• functional, reported as percentage activity compared with normal
fresh plasma.
• Normal range:
• immunochemical, 0.18-0.54g/L (paediatric ranges not well deﬁned,
but lower than adult ranges)
• functional, 80-120% normal plasma.

Principles of tests
• Immunochemical measurement is carried out by RID or nephelometry;
functional assay is usually a colorimetric assay.
• If C4 is low in patient with angioedema and immunochemical
C1-esterase inhibitor is normal or high, suspect type II HAE and
measure C1-esterase inhibitor function.
• If immunochemical C1-esterase inhibitor is low/absent, there is no
additional value in measuring functional C1-esterase inhibitor.
• There are a number of speciﬁc assays for functional C1-esterase
inhibitor, including commercial colorimetric assays. Some require
citrated plasma while others require serum, and it is important to
check which samples are required by the local laboratory.
• The inhibitor is labile, and samples should be separated as soon as
possible to avoid artefactually reduced levels.

Indications for testing
• Key indication is angioedema occurring without urticaria at any age.
If urticaria is present, diagnosis is almost never C1-esterase inhibitor
deﬁciency.
• C4 is a useful screen: normal C4 during an attack excludes C1-esterase
inhibitor deﬁciency.

Interpretation
• C1-esterase inhibitor is a control protein of the classical pathway.
C1-esterase inhibitor deﬁciency causes hereditary angioedema.
• Two main types of HAE are recognized (others may exist—see
Chapter 1).
• Type I (common, 80%): absence of immunochemical C1-esterase
inhibitor.
• Type II (rare, 20%): presence of non-functional C1-esterase
inhibitor; due to point mutations affecting enzyme active site;
immunochemical levels normal or high.
• Both are inherited as autosomal dominants.
• HAE presents with angioedema but no urticaria; may involve larynx
and gut; usual onset at puberty.
• C4 absent during acute attacks. See Chapter 1 for treatment.

449

450

CHAPTER 17

Immunochemistry

• Rare acquired form due to autoantibody to C1-esterase inhibitor (SLE,
myeloma, splenic villous lymphoma); C1q levels are reduced and a
paraprotein may be present.
• The development of new angioedema in an older patient should lead
to a search for such a paraprotein (immunoglobulins, electrophoresis,
paraprotein, and B2-microglobulin) and its source (look in spleen and
lymph nodes; consider CT scan), as well for evidence of complement
consumption.

Complement breakdown products
Measurements of speciﬁc complement breakdown products such as C3bi
and C3d are more valuable as markers of complement turnover. Several
tests are available.
• Units:
• C3d, mg/L
• SC5b-9, μg/L.
• Normal range:
• C3d, <150mg/L
• SC5b-9, <60μg/L.

Principles of tests
• C3 breakdown products may be detected by speciﬁc antisera,
in radial immunodiffusion assays, Laurell rocket electrophoresis,
immunoﬁxation, and by sandwich ELISA (SC5b-9).
• There is no gold standard. Commercial RID plates have been
withdrawn because of issues with CE marking!
• Because some activation of C3 occurs with blood clotting, it is
essential that samples are taken into EDTA which chelates the calcium
required for C3 degradation.

Indications for testing
• Testing for C3 breakdown products is essential in any condition in
which complement consumption is suspected.
• As C3 (and other complement proteins) is an acute-phase protein,
levels may be normal even with consumption. Therefore measurement
of breakdown is the only reliable way of detecting the complementconsuming process.

Interpretation
• C3d levels correlate with disease activity in SLE and are also elevated
in patients with severe diffuse cutaneous disease associated with
systemic sclerosis.
• They are valuable because, as noted above, C3 is an acute-phase
protein and levels may remain within the normal range despite
signiﬁcant consumption if there is an acute phase.
• Other assays have been studied. The best seems to be a multistage
sandwich ELISA to detect the terminal lytic complex C5b-C9. This
also correlates well with disease activity, but is a more expensive and
complicated assay.

OTHER INDIVIDUAL COMPLEMENT COMPONENTS

C1q
• Units, mg/L.
• Normal range, adults 50-250mg/L (PRU).

Principles of test
• Measurement is usually by RID.

Indications
• Abnormal CH100, with normal APCH100.
• Suspected acquired angioedema.

Interpretation
• Low C1q is supposedly associated speciﬁcally with acquired but not
hereditary angioedema.
• Familial deﬁciency may occur, causing recurrent bacterial infections,
SLE, and glomerulonephritis.

Other individual complement
components
• Units: usually qualitative detection; where measurements are made
units are mg/L.
• Normal adult range: present (PRU handbook quotes indicative ranges).
Reported as present or absent, as a percentage of control serum, or in
mg/L.

Principles of tests
• Measurement of individual complement components requires the
availability of speciﬁc antisera.
• They are usually detected by either double diffusion or RID.
• It may be necessary to carry out functional assays, with
complementation by other sera with known complement deﬁciencies.
• Measurement of individual components should follow, not precede, a
functional evaluation by CH100/APCH100 to determine the location of
the missing component.

Indications for testing
• Testing is of value in the investigation of recurrent meningococcal
disease, glomerulonephritis (C1q, C2, C3), pyogenic infections
(C3, factors D, P, I), and atypical lupus (C1q, C2, C4, C5-8), where
deﬁciency of a complement component is suspected.

Interpretation
• C2 levels will be reduced in activation of the classical pathway.
However, C2 deﬁciency is the most common deﬁciency of the
complement pathway, with C2 null alleles occurring at a frequency of
between 1 in 100-500.

451

452

CHAPTER 17

Immunochemistry

• C2 deﬁciency often leads to an atypical form of lupus in which skin
manifestations are common.
• As active lupus will lower C2 levels through consumption, it is often
difﬁcult to be sure whether complete C2 deﬁciency is present.
• However, in complete deﬁciency CH100 will be absent.
• Genetic studies may be necessary to conﬁrm the diagnosis.
• Other complement components may be absent in atypical lupus,
glomerulonephritis, and pyogenic infections.

C3a, C4a, and C5a (anaphylotoxins)
• Units: μg/L.
• Normal ranges:
• C3a, 10-570μg/L (EDTA plasma)
• C4a, 102-212μg/L
• C5a, <10μg/L.

Principles of test
• Assays are not readily available (radio-immunoassay), but the PRUs
offer testing.
• Samples need special handling as the anaphylotoxins are labile: special
collection tubes containing a protease inhibitor, nafamostat (Futhan®),
as well as EDTA are required. The commercial supplier of these tubes
has now ceased production. Immediate separation and freezing of the
plasma is required for accurate measurement.

Indications for testing
• Anaphylotoxins are released as part of the activation process of the
complement cascade, being cleaved off their parent molecules. All
share a terminal arginine, which is essential for biological activity and
is removed by carboxypeptidase-N, the enzyme responsible for their
inactivation.
• All are potent triggers for histamine release and smooth muscle
constrictors, and they increase vascular permeability. They also act as
chemotactic factors and aggregate neutrophils.
• Clinical utility of measurements of the anaphylotoxins is limited,
although they may be valuable in monitoring shocked patients,
patients with respiratory distress syndrome, and patients undergoing
extracorporeal circulation.
• Although anaphylotoxins change in other conditions with complement
activation, such as SLE, there are other more convenient assays that
will give the same information.

CRYOGLOBULINS

Complement factors H and I
• Units: mg/L.
• Normal range:
• factor H, 430-610mg/L
• factor I, 38-58mg/L.

Principles of test
• RID is used to measure factors H and I.

Indications for testing
• Haemolytic-uraemic syndrome (HUS).

Interpretation
• Deﬁciency of either of these factors may lead to HUS. Measurement is
possible in specialized centres, with follow-up genetic testing.

C4-binding protein (C4BP)
• Units: μg/L.
• Normal range, adults: 140-220μg/L.
• C4BP is an acute-phase regulatory protein of the complement system,
as a cofactor for factor I.
• It binds to protein S and serum amyloid P (SAP).
• Familial deﬁciency has been associated with atypical Behçet’s
syndrome.
• Raised levels are seen in young patients with stroke (reduced free
protein S) and in pregnancy, nephrotic syndrome, DIC, SLE, and
recurrent thromboses.

Cryoglobulins
• Units: usually reported qualitatively but a ‘cryocrit’ can be measured
using capillary tubesin a similar way to a manual haematocrit. The
cryocrit will be reported as a percentage of the serum volume.
• Normal range: tiny amounts of cryoglobulins may be found in normal
individuals.

Principles of test
• Cryoglobulins are immunoglobulins which precipitate when serum is
cooled. The temperature at which this occurs determines whether
disease will result. If the blood circulates through a part of the body
where the temperature is below the critical temperature, the protein
will precipitate in the capillaries causing obstruction, vascular damage,
and eventually necrosis.
• The reason for cold insolubility is unknown but may be due to
abnormal amino acid structure (paraproteins) and abnormal
glycosylation (connective tissue disease).

453

454

CHAPTER 17

Immunochemistry

• All immunoglobulins will precipitate to a small extent in the cold.
• The temperature of the hand is approximately 28ºC at ambient room
temperature. Immunoglobulins which precipitate at or above 28ºC
will cause clinical problems (obviously lower if ambient temperature is
reduced).
• To detect cryoglobulins, take blood using a warmed syringe into a
warmed bottle and transport to laboratory at 37ºC, using a Thermos
ﬂask containing either pre-warmed sand or water at 37ºC. The
laboratory will allow the blood to clot at 37ºC and then cool the
serum to 4ºC.
• Cryoglobulins will form a precipitate as the temperature drops. This
usually occurs within 24 hours, but occasionally takes longer.
• The precipitate is then washed and re-dissolved for analysis by
electrophoresis and immunoﬁxation.
• The re-dissolved cryoprecipitate should be tested for rheumatoid
factor activity.
• Measurement of immunoglobulin in sera with cryoglobulins will give
misleading results on nephelometers and turbidimeters. RID carried
out at 37ºC is required.
• Cryoglobulins are not the same as cold agglutinins (a feature of
Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection).

Indications for testing
• All patients with Raynaud’s phenomenon of new onset, or with winter
onset of purpuric or vasculitic lesions on the extremities.
• Chronic hepatitis C infection is often accompanied by type II
cryoglobulinaemia and a characteristic syndrome: ‘mixed essential
cryoglobulinaemia’ = autoimmune phenomena, arthritis, ulceration,
glomerulonephritis, neuropathy. C3 is normal, and C4 is reduced.
• Patients with myeloma, SLE, Sjögren’s syndrome, and rheumatoid
arthritis.

Interpretation (see Table 17.4)
• Most cryoglobulins are IgG or IgM; IgA and free light-chain
cryoglobulins are rare.
• HCV-associated cryoglobulins are very common in northern Italy.
• In infection-triggered cryoglobulinaemia, the immunoglobulins may
have speciﬁcity against the infecting agent.

CSF PROTEINS

Cryoﬁbrinogen
Cryoﬁbrinogen
• This is found less commonly than cryoglobulins, and presents with
typical cold-induced vasculitic lesions on exposed areas.
• To detect a cryoﬁbrinogen, paired EDTA and clotted samples (not
heparin) must be taken at 37ºC and transported at that temperature
to the laboratory, where the serum and plasma will be separated
warm and then cooled to 4ºC. The cryoprecipitate will form only
in the EDTA plasma. This is washe and, redissolved, and its identity
is conﬁrmed by either direct measurement or immunoﬁxation on
electrophoresis.
• The main association is with occult malignancy and thrombophlebitis
migrans. Most common tumours are myeloma, leukaemia, and
carcinoma of the prostate.
• Also associated with IgA nephropathy, connective tissue disease,
pregnancy, OCP use, diabetes mellitus, and cold urticaria.
• A separate form may also be seen in heparin-treated patients when
the heparin acts as a cofactor for the precipitation.

C-reactive protein (CRP)
See ‘Acute-phase proteins’, p.439.

CSF proteins
• Units: g/L.
• Normal adult range:
• IgG, 0.01-0.05g/L
• albumin, 0.06-0.26 g/L
• IgG:albumin ratio, <22%.

Principles of test
• IgG and albumin measured by nephelometry.
• Oligoclonal bands detected by isoelectric focusing (IEF) and
immunoblotting of paired serum and CSF.

Indications for testing
• Measurements of CSF IgG, albumin, and detection of oligoclonal bands
are useful as adjunctive tests in the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis.
• Other CSF proteins (myelin basic protein and tau proteins) can be
measured at PRUs; these may provide other conﬁrmatory evidence in
suspected demyelination.

Interpretation
• When the blood-brain barrier is intact, mainly low molecular weight
proteins are found in the CSF.

455

456

CHAPTER 17

Immunochemistry

• Any inﬂammatory disease increases the passage of proteins into the
CSF, including those of higher molecular weight.
• Certain conditions are associated with the presence of plasma cells
within the brain, leading to local immunoglobulin production which is
oligoclonal.
• Contamination of the CSF with blood through poor lumbar puncture
(LP) technique renders the test uninterpretable.
• Elevation of the CSF IgG or a ratio of CSF IgG to CSF albumin >22% is
strongly suggestive of intrathecal synthesis.
• Intrathecal synthesis of IgG is present if IEF bands are detected in CSF
but not serum.
• Oligoclonal IgG bands in the CSF are found in MS, but may also occur
in encephalitis, neurosarcoid, neurosyphilis, meningitis, polyneuritis,
subacute sclerosing panencephalitis, SLE, and tumours.
• If a paraprotein is present in serum, it may also be found in the CSF.
• Complex calculations of other indices, based on CSF and serum IgG,
IgM, and albumin concentrations, and on the IgG synthetic rate, have
been proposed. They add little information to that obtained from the
CSF IgG:albumin ratio, which costs half as much.
• Where unusual infections are suspected, it may be valuable to
compare the ratio of speciﬁc antiviral titres in the CSF and serum
with the equivalent ratio for IgG; if the ratio is higher for the speciﬁc
antibody, this suggests that there is a CNS infection.

Fungal precipitins
• Units: semi-quantitative.
• Normal range:
• may be found in healthy exposed individuals
• highest titres in heavily exposed individuals.

Principles of test
• Precipitating IgG antibodies to fungal antigens are usually detected
by immunodiffusion, although ELISA, UNICAP®, and ﬂuorescent
techniques are also used.

Indications for testing
• Suspected type III hypersensitivity pneumonitis to fungal or other
proteins.

Interpretation
• Farmer’s lung is typically associated with antibodies to Aspergillus
fumigatus, Thermoactinomyces vulgaris, and Micropolyspora faeni.
• Other occupational lung diseases (malt-worker’s lung, etc.) may be
associated with other fungi, including Aspergillus clavatus.
• Antigens are predominantly low molecular weight.
• Antibodies are not diagnostic, but are markers of exposure and should
always be interpreted in the light of clinical ﬁndings.
• Usually few precipitin lines are present.

HAPTOGLOBIN

• Concentration of the sera may be required to reveal weak lines.
• The antibody response is reduced in smokers.
• When an aspergilloma (fungus ball) is present, often in an old
tuberculous cavity, antibodies to high molecular weight antigens may
be detected. Here there are multiple precipitin lines and the antibodies
are frequently readily detectable, even in unconcentrated sera.
• Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) is an eosinophilic
pneumonia, which is also associated with precipitating antibodies to
Aspergillus fumigatus. Total IgE and Aspergillus-speciﬁc IgE are elevated.
• Other fungi that are associated with an IgE-mediated response include
Cladosporium, Alternaria, and Penicillium species. These are associated
mainly with asthmatic symptoms (e.g. in inhabitants of damp mouldy
accommodation).
• Some hypersensitivity pneumonitides (cheese-worker’s lung, humidiﬁer
fever (Penicillium); wood-worker’s lung (Alternaria)) may be associated
with precipitins to these fungi, but the tests are not reliable for
diagnoses as the fungi are ubiquitous and many healthy individuals have
antibodies.
• IgG antibodies to Candida species may be found in otherwise healthy
individuals, indicating the ubiquitous nature of the yeast. These include
antibodies against the mannan component (polysaccharide), as well as
protein antigens.
• Absence of antibodies to Candida albicans mannan may suggest the
possibility of a humoral immune deﬁciency.
• Patients with chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis (Chapter 1) often
have very high levels of IgG precipitins to Candida, with multiple
precipitin lines, and this is helpful in diagnosis.
• Testing for antibodies to Candida in other immunodeﬁciencies, such as
HIV infection, when yeast infection is suspected is unreliable. Similar
constraints apply to detection of antibodies to Nocardia.

Haptoglobin
• Units: g/L.
• Normal adult range: 1.0-3.0g/L.

Principles of test
• Nephelometry/turbidimetry.

Indications for testing
• Suspected haemolysis.

Interpretation
• Haptoglobin is an A2-globulin that is involved in the recycling of haem
iron by binding liberated haemoglobin.
• Levels are markedly reduced in the presence of haemolysis.
• Other diseases leading to increased red cell fragility, such as sickle-cell
disease, thalassaemia, and G6PD deﬁciency, are also associated with
reduced haptoglobin levels.

457

458

CHAPTER 17

Immunochemistry

• Genetic lack of haptoglobin has been reported.
• Elevated levels are seen in biliary obstruction, aplastic anaemia, and as
part of an acute-phase response.
• Haptoglobin exists in polymeric forms, which gives rise to difﬁculties in
measurement by RID.

ICAM-1, soluble
• Proposed as marker of vascular graft rejection as released by activated
endothelium.
• Assay by EIA, but this is costly and requires samples to be batched.
• Therefore the test is not economically viable for routine use, as
turnaround appropriate to clinical needs cannot be achieved.
• Monitoring CRP and B2-microglobulin is more practical, as these tests
can be run daily on automated analysers.

Anti-IgA antibodies
• Units: titre.
• Normal range: not deﬁned.

Principles of test
• ELISA and tanned red cell agglutination are used.
• Assay detects IgM and IgG but not IgE antibodies.

Indications for testing
• Investigation of transfusion reactions including reactions to IVIg.

Interpretation
• Reported in the context of reactions to blood products and
immunoglobulins.
• Will only occur in patients with complete absence of IgA (selective IgA
deﬁciency, CVID).
• Expected to be rare in XLA where there is no capacity to produce
antibody of any class.
• May be found in healthy IgA-deﬁcient individuals.
• Clinical signiﬁcance is uncertain. IgE antibodies have been reported and
may be more signiﬁcant in the context of acute transfusion reactions;
these are not detected by current assays.
• Risk of adverse reactions in IgA-deﬁcient individuals is estimated at 1 in
15 million.
• Similar problems of transfusion reactions have been found in patients
with deﬁciencies of either C4A or C4B (Chido and Rodgers blood
groups), as they may also see infused C4 as foreign and make an
antibody response.

IMMUNOGLOBULINS (TOTAL SERUM) 1

IgA subclasses and IgD
IgA subclasses
• IgA exists as two subclasses: IgA1, the predominant serum IgA, and
IgA2, which occurs in secretions with IgA1 in roughly equal amounts.
• Speciﬁc deﬁciencies of IgA1 and IgA2, either alone or in combination
with other immunoglobulin abnormalities, have been described.
• There are no routine indications for measurement but it has been
suggested that measurement of IgA subclasses may be valuable in the
investigation of recurrent Haemophilus infection of the respiratory
tract.
• May also be valuable in the investigation of transfusion reactions where
some IgA is detected, as the patient may be deﬁcient in only one
subclass and hence see the other subclass as ‘foreign’.

IgD
• Rarely measured in clinical practice, as its main function is as a
membrane receptor.
• Elevated levels may be seen in the periodic fever syndrome, hyper-IgD
syndrome due to deﬁciency of mevalonate kinase, and in IgD-secreting
myeloma (rare).
• Measurement is usually by radial immunodiffusion.

Immunoglobulins (total serum) 1
• Units: g/L.
• Normal range (adults only):
• IgG, 5.8-15.4g/L
• IgA, 0.64-2.97g/L
• IgM (males), 0.24-1.90g/L
• IgM (females), 0.75-2.30g/L.

Principles of assay
• Normally rate nephelometry/turbidimetry.
• Rarely, radial immunodiffusion may be used: this is slow and less
accurate.
• For automated analysers, coefﬁcients of variation should be in the
5-10% range. Results are standardized against international standards.
In the UK, an EQA scheme operates.
• Laboratories should provide normal ranges which vary according to
age and sex. Unfortunately, many laboratories do not adjust ranges for
age and sex, which may lead to confusion.

Indications for testing
Measurement of serum immunoglobulin is indicated in the following
conditions.
• Suspected immunodeﬁciency (primary or secondary): diagnosis and
monitoring.

459

460

CHAPTER 17

Immunochemistry

• Suspected myeloma, Waldenström’s macroglobulinaemia,
plasmacytoma: diagnosis and monitoring.
• Lymphoma.
• Connective tissue disease.
• Liver disease (primary biliary cirrhosis, hepatitis, cirrhosis).
• Sarcoidosis: diagnosis.
• Post-bone marrow/stem cell transplantation: monitoring.

Interpretation
• Measurement of serum immunoglobulins does not provide categorical
diagnosis in any disease.
• Normal serum immunoglobulins do not exclude immunodeﬁciency.
• In all cases, measurement of immunoglobulins must be accompanied
by serum electrophoresis and immunoﬁxation to look for paraproteins
(see ‘Immunoﬁxation’, p.463).
• Where IgA is low, further tests (Ouchterlony double diffusion, lowlevel IgA EIA) should be carried out to prove whether IgA is low or
absent.
• Transient reductions in all Ig classes are seen in acute bacterial
infections. Do not act on a single acute measurement—recheck in
convalescence.
• IgM normal ranges in adult show a sex difference (lower in males).
Many laboratories report an average range; this is incorrect.
• Non-white populations have higher normal ranges than white
Caucasian populations.
• Serum IgA levels may be raised in healthy elderly because of a change
in the balance between synthesis and mucosal loss.
• Raised immunoglobulins on a polyclonal background (on
electrophoresis) indicates chronic infection/inﬂammation.

Immunoglobulins (total
serum) 2: causes of hypo- and
hypergammaglobulinaemia
Causes of hypogammaglobulinaemia
• X-linked agammaglobulinaemia (absent B cells; all immunoglobulins
low/absent).
• Common variable immunodeﬁciency (reduced T/B cells; low
immunoglobulins).
• Hyper-IgM syndrome (normal/raised IgM; low/absent IgG, IgA).
• Selective IgA deﬁciency (absent IgA; normal IgG, IgM).
• Severe combined immunodeﬁciency (mainly children; all
immunoglobulins low; absent T cells).
• Lymphoma (reduced IgM; IgA normal; IgG normal or low; disease,
chemotherapy or radiotherapy).

IMMUNOGLOBULINS (TOTAL SERUM) 2

• SLE (rare).
• Infections:
• HIV (rare)
• herpesviruses (rare, EBV in X-linked lymphoproliferative disease)
• acute bacterial infections
• measles/rubella.
• Drugs: immunosuppressives (e.g.cyclophosphamide, azathioprine,
chemotherapy).
• Plasmapheresis.
• Renal loss (IgM normal; IgG and IgA reduced).
• Gastrointestinal loss (IgM normal; IgG and IgA reduced).

Causes of hypergammaglobulinaemia
• Chronic infection (all immunoglobulins raised):
• osteomyelitis
• bacterial endocarditis
• tuberculosis.
• Chronic inﬂammation:
• SLE, rheumatoid arthritis—all immunoglobulins elevated
• Sjögren’s syndrome—raised IgG (all IgG1; normal or reduced IgG2,
IgG3, IgG4).
• Sarcoidosis: raised IgG and IgA; IgM usually normal.
• Liver disease:
• primary biliary cirrhosis (IgM, may be very high (>30 g/L) with small
monoclonal bands on a polyclonally raised background)
• alcohol-related (increased IgA, polyclonal, B-G bridging on
electrophoresis)
• autoimmune hepatitis (increased IgG, IgA; normal IgM).
• Hodgkin’s disease—IgE raised (also eosinophilia).
• Viral infections:
• acute common viral infections—raised IgM, normal IgG and IgA
• HIV—all immunoglobulins raised (IgG very high but polyclonal)
• EBV—all raised.

0 Critical action

• All patients with recurrent infections should be reviewed by
an immunologist or paediatric immunologist (as appropriate),
irrespective of age. Any patient with recurrent infections and low
serum immunoglobulins has an immunological problem until proven
otherwise.
• Recurrent infections can be pragmatically deﬁned as two or more
major microbiologically/virologically proven infections, requiring
hospitalization, within 1 year. One major infection and recurrent
minor infections should also be referred, where minor infections are
documented infections requiring treatment in the community.
• Patients with unusual infections, or with illness caused by opportunist
or normally non-pathogenic organism infections, and patients with
infections in unusual sites (without good reason) should all be referred
for further investigation.

CHAPTER 17

Immunochemistry

IgG subclasses
• Units: g/L.
• Normal range (adults):
• IgG1, 2.2-10.8g/L
• IgG2, 0.5-8.0g/L
• IgG3, 0.05-0.9g/L
• IgG4, 0.0-2.4g/L.

Principles of test
• Normally measured by nephelometry or turbidimetry.
• Radial immunodiffusion is still occasionally used.
• EQA scheme exists.

Indications for testing
• No absolute indications for testing, as signiﬁcant immunodeﬁciency can
occur in the presence of normal subclasses and, conversely, complete
genetic absence of a subclass may be completely asymptomatic.
• Measurement usually performed as part of the work-up of patients
with recurrent infections.

Interpretation
• Low levels may be signiﬁcant in the context of presentation with
recurrent infections.
• IgG1 deﬁciency is essentially similar in effects to CVID, as IgG1
comprises the bulk of total serum IgG.
• IgG2 levels are slow to rise to adult levels. Levels are related to Gm
allotypes, which are racially determined.
• IgG2 levels correlate poorly with anti-polysaccharide responses.
• IgG2 deﬁciency may be seen in patients with IgA deﬁciency and may
be associated with poor responses to polysaccharide antigens such as
the capsular polysaccharides of bacteria (see Chapter 1).
• IgG2 and IgG4 deﬁciency frequently coexist.
• Deﬁciency of IgG3, which is involved in immunity against viruses, is
associated with asthma and intractable epilepsy.
• Isolated IgG4 deﬁciency is of uncertain signiﬁcance. It may be
associated with suppurative lung disease.
• Raised IgG4 has been associated with a range of unusual autoimmune
diseases (see Chapter 12, ‘IgG4-related chronic sclerosing
dacryoadenitis’, p.282), including autoimmune pancreatitis (see Chapter
7, ‘Autoimmune pancreatitis’, p.221).
• Polyclonal raised IgG1 with normal or reduced IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4
is seen in Sjögren’s syndrome and is a speciﬁc pattern which may
occasionally be helpful in diagnosis.
• A high total IgG may mask a low/absent IgG subclass or speciﬁc
antibody deﬁciency.

IMMUNOFIXATION

Immune complexes
• No longer recommended for routine use because of difﬁculties in
reproducibility and standardization.
• Many different assays are described, but performance characteristics
are all different and there is no gold standard or EQA.
• Immune complexes may be detected in healthy individuals and form
part of the normal immune response.
• Use of more speciﬁc markers of complement activation, such as C3
breakdown products or sC5b-C9 complexes, is recommended.

Immunoﬁxation
• Units: qualitative.
• Normal range: no monoclonal bands should be identiﬁable.

Principles of test
• Immunoﬁxation has replaced immunoelectrophoresis as test of choice
for identiﬁcation of bands on electrophoresis of serum and urine.
• An electrophorectic strip of the test serum in agarose is overlaid with
antibodies speciﬁc for heavy and light chains (or any other protein
of interest, e.g. ﬁbrinogen, CRP) and allowed to react. Unreacted
antibody and serum is then washed from the gel and the remaining
precipitate stained with a protein-binding dye.

Indications for testing
• Any serum or urine electrophoresis in which bands are identiﬁed
should undergo immunoﬁxation.

Interpretation
• Bands should be identiﬁed with both heavy and light chains.
• Any serum bands with light chain only should undergo ﬁxation with
anti-IgD and anti-IgE to exclude rare myelomas.
• Heavy-chain disease (μ, A, G) is rare and it is more common for there
to be failure of reactivity of antisera with the light chain. Serum free
light chains are more common.
• Occasionally, paraproteins may react poorly with an antiserum and it
may be necessary to re-ﬁx using antiserum from a different source.
This is important if heavy-chain-only disease is suspected.
• Serum and urine must always be checked together.
• More than one paraprotein may be identiﬁed, with different heavy and
light chains.
• IgA paraproteins may show polymerization with multiple ‘step-ladder’
bands.
• Serum free light chains may show any mobility and may appear in the
pre-albumin region.

463

464

CHAPTER 17

Immunochemistry

• A prozone effect may be seen if the paraprotein level is very high, with
poor immunoﬁxation. Re-run with serum at several dilutions.
• Fibrinogen and CRP may cause bands if plasma is used or serum CRP
is signiﬁcantly raised; both run in the B-G region of the electrophoretic
strip. Well-clotted serum will not show ﬁbrinogen bands.

Interleukin-2 receptors, soluble
• Serum levels of soluble IL-2 receptors are useful for monitoring solid
organ allograft recipients, as levels rise early in rejection episodes.
• Levels also rise in acute graft-versus-host disease.
• Elevated levels are seen in other conditions associated with
lymphocyte activation, but on the whole are not clinically useful.
• Measurement is usually by EIA, but this approach is expensive and not
easily applicable to the very rapid turnaround required for monitoring
graft rejection at reasonable cost.

Isohaemagglutinins
• Isohaemagglutinins are mainly of the IgM class, although IgG antibodies
may also be detected.
• Measurement of isohaemagglutinins is essential in the investigation of
suspected immunodeﬁciency, as they are the only permanently present
IgM antibodies that can be readily measured.
• Test cannot be used in individuals of blood group AB, who lack
isohaemagglutinins.
• Titres are very low in small infants aged under 1 year.
• Presence of high titres of IgG isohaemagglutinins in IVIg has been
associated with signiﬁcant haemolysis in isolated case reports. Where
very high doses are used, it may be appropriate to ‘cross-match’ the
IVIg against the patient’s red cells ﬁrst.

Mannose-binding lectin (MBL)
• Units: ng/mL.
• Range (adults):
• <75ng/mL—homozygous variant alleles and non-functional MBL,
associated with the highest risk of infection
• 75-399.9ng/mL—functional MBL deﬁciency associated with
increased risk of infection
• 400-1300ng/mL—heterozygous variant alleles; may show evidence
of mild deﬁciency associated with some increased risk of infections
• >1300ng/mL—wild-type alleles showing no deﬁciency

NEOPTERIN AND OROSOMUCOID

Principles of test
• Measurement is usually by EIA. Assays for the function of the MBL
pathway, analogous to the CH100 pathway, are being developed.

Indications for testing
• Patients with unexplained infections, as part of the work-up for
immune deﬁciency.
• Patients with cystic ﬁbrosis and Behçet’s disease as prognostic marker.

Interpretation
• MBL is one of the collectin family of carbohydrate-binding proteins.
Structurally it strongly resembles C1q and is capable of activating
complement directly (collectin or MBL pathway).
• MBL functions as a soluble non-speciﬁc opsonin, binding to
oligosaccharides.
• It has been suggested that the deﬁciency is only signiﬁcant if other
aspects of the innate or speciﬁc immune system are impaired, when
chronic infections, in particular otitis media and chronic diarrhoea, may
occur.
• In adults, reduced/absent MBL is a cofactor for recurrent infections
when other factors are present.
• Risk can be quantitated in terms of the degree of reduction, which is
linked to genetic status.
• Reduced MBL is associated with increased severity of cystic ﬁbrosis
and Behçet’s disease.

Neopterin and orosomucoid
Neopterin
• Neopterin is a pteridine that is synthesized predominantly in
macrophages. Levels are increased in diseases when macrophages are
active.
• It can be measured in CSF and urine in addition to serum.
• It has been proposed as a useful surrogate marker in HIV disease.
However, levels correlate closely with those of B2-microglobulin and
only one or the other need be measured.
• Levels have also been reported to be elevated in other viral,
protozoal, and bacterial infections, especially TB, inﬂammatory bowel
disease, tumours, and chronic fatigue syndrome. Thus it is not a
speciﬁc marker of HIV infection or progress.
• Commercial ELISA assays are available.
• Routine diagnostic use is not recommended.

Orosomucoid
See ‘A1-acid glycoprotein’, p.436.

465

466

CHAPTER 17

Immunochemistry

Paraprotein by scanning densitometry
• Units: g/L.
• Normal range: monoclonal proteins should not be detectable.

Principles of test
• Test measures the amount of monoclonal immunoglobulin by scanning
a stained electrophoretic strip.
• Measurement of the total protein is also required (measured
chemically).
• Some departments quantitate and report all fractions on the
elctrophoretic strip. This is unnecessary as a routine, but can be a
valuable internal check for observational reporting of electrophoresis
(raised A2, increased G, etc.).

Indications for testing
• All patients in whom serum electrophoresis shows a discrete
monoclonal protein.
• Serial monitoring of paraprotein provides an excellent check on the
progress of myeloma and related conditions.

Interpretation
• Results from paraprotein measurement may not correlate well with
the immunochemical measurements, particularly for IgM and IgA
paraproteins, where polymerization may occur in the serum and give
erroneous results by nephelometry.
• Healthy adults do not have detectable levels of paraproteins, but
up to 20% of elderly patients over the age of 75 will have low levels
of paraproteins (<10g/L = monoclonal gammopathy of uncertain
signiﬁcance (MGUS)).
• Chronic infections and chronic inﬂammatory conditions may also
cause low levels of paraproteins, usually in a polyclonal background of
increased immunoglobulin.
• Transient monoclonal bands may appear after bone marrow
transplantation.
• Bands that overlie the B-region cannot be scanned accurately because
of interference from other B-proteins. The interference increases as
the paraprotein levels drop. Complex correction formulae exist, but
do not increase accuracy.

Pneumococcal polysaccharide
antibodies
Pneumococcal polysaccharide antibodies
See ‘Bacterial and viral antibodies’, p.442.

SERUM ELECTROPHORESIS AND IMMUNOFIXATION

Pyroglobulins
• Pyroglobulins are immunoglobulins that precipitate as the temperature
of the body rises above normal.
• They may appear as a consequence of myeloma owing to structurally
abnormal proteins.
• Investigation requires a cool sample to be taken and separated and the
serum is then warmed to 40°C and the precipitate observed.

Salivary IgA and secretory piece
• This is a qualitative test for the presence of mucosal antibody and may
be helpful in the work-up of suspected immunodeﬁciency.
• True secretory piece deﬁciency is exceptionally rare.
• The usual technique for detection is by double diffusion.

Serum electrophoresis and
immunoﬁxation
• Units:
• not applicable to electrophoresis (qualitative)
• paraprotein quantitated by scanning densitometry reported in g/L
(see ‘Paraprotein by scanning densitometry’, p.466).
• Normal range: not applicable.

Principles of testing
• In serum or urinary electrophoresis, the relevant body ﬂuid is applied to
an electrolyte-containing agarose gel. A current is applied across the gel
and causes the proteins to migrate through the gel on the basis of their
charge, and to a lesser extent size, until they reach a neutral point in the
electric ﬁeld. The proteins are then visualized with a protein-binding stain.
• If the total protein is known, the electrophoretic strip can be scanned
and the absorption by the stain measured, which will be proportional
to the amount of protein in the particular region in the gel (scanning
densitometry). Thus any monoclonal bands can be directly measured.
This is useful for patients with myeloma, as immunochemical methods
for measurement of immunoglobulins may be inaccurate in patients
with myeloma (see ‘Paraprotein by scanning densitometry, p.466).
• Immunoﬁxation is the technique by which monoclonal
immunoglobulins are identiﬁed by overlaying the electrophoresed
strips with antisera against heavy and light chains. These precipitate
with the monoclonal proteins in the gel, and unbound antisera can be
washed free prior to staining (see ‘Immunoﬁxation’, p.463).
• The same techniques can be carried out with urine, although this may
require concentration to provide the clearest results.
• Cellulose acetate electrophoresis is no longer recommended as it is
less sensitive and is not suitable for densitometric scanning.
• High-throughput semi-automated instruments are available (CZE).

467

468

CHAPTER 17

Immunochemistry

Indications for testing
• Electrophoresis and, if necessary, immunoﬁxation of serum is an
integral part of measurement of serum immunoglobulins.
0 ALL requests for serum immunoglobulins must have electrophoresis
carried out: failure to do so will lead to important abnormalities being
missed.
0 There is no place for carrying out electrophoresis as a stand-alone test.

Interpretation (see Table 17.5)
• Serum electrophoresis gives valuable information, not only about
immunological status but also about other organ systems.
• Reports are often poorly understood by clinicians and not explained
by laboratories.
• The reports that may be seen and their interpretation are shown in
Table 17.5.
• Monoclonal proteins may polymerize to give more than one band,
typically IgA.
• Some patients will have more than one clone present, producing
different immunoglobulins.
• Densitometry cannot be used where the monoclonal protein overlies
the B-region, as the ﬁgures include non-immunoglobulin proteins (see
‘Paraprotein by scanning densitometry’, p.466).

Table 17.5 Interpretation of serum electrophoresis reports
Report

Interpretation

Reduced albumin

Chronic inﬂammation, nephrotic syndrome

Absent A1 band

Absent/reduced A1-antitrypsin

Increased A2 band

Chronic inﬂammation/infection; also seen in
nephrotic syndrome owing to selective retention of
A2-macroglobulin

Increased B

Seen in pregnancy (raised B-lipoprotein) and iron
deﬁciency (transferrin)

B-G bridging

Caused by raised polyclonal IgA, e.g. cirrhosis of
the liver

Increased G

Caused by polyclonal increase in IgG: infection/
inﬂammation

Faint band(s) on
polyclonal background

Caused by monoclonal escape during polyclonal
response to infection/inﬂammation (does not indicate
myeloma)

Monoclonal band in G

Due to myeloma, lymphoma, and MGUS

Absent/reduced G

Due to inherited or acquired immunoglobulin
deﬁciency (further investigation essential)

MGUS, monoclonal gammopathy of uncertain signiﬁcance. Most evolve to myeloma given
time (years).

TRANSFERRIN

Serum free light chains (SFLC)
• Units: mg/L.
• Normal adult range: serum free κ g/L
Serum free λ g/L
Normal ratio

3.3-19.4mg/L
5.70-26.30mg/L
0.260-1.650

Principles of test
• SFLC are measured by nephelometry. Free λ light chains tend to be
dimeric, while κ chains are monomeric. Recognition is by polyclonal
antisera speciﬁc for free, not bound, light chains.

Indications for testing
• Diagnosis and monitoring of myeloma and other paraproteinaemic
states; AL amyloid.

Interpretation
• SFLC are a sensitive test for free light chains, usually produced in
excess in myeloma.
• SFLC may be the only product of the tumour cells.
• SFLC are nephrotoxic and therefore may give a more accurate
measure of tumour burden than urinary free light chains.
• Ratio and absolute values may need to be corrected in renal
impairment.
• SFLC are likely to replace BMG as a marker of tumour mass and urine
electrophoresis and immunoﬁxation (about 10 times more sensitive).
• Both κ and λ light chains may be elevated in patients with chronic
inﬂammatory conditions and in the elderly.
• Serial monitoring is appropriate.
• SFLC are useful in determining the prognosis of monoclonal
gammopathies of uncertain signiﬁcance (MGUS).

Transferrin
•
•
•
•

Units: g/L.
Normal adult range: 2.0-4.0g/L.
Serum transferrin is increased in iron deﬁciency and pregnancy.
It is reduced in anaemia of chronic disease, chronic infections, burns,
and rare genetic absence.
• It is a ‘negative’ acute-phase protein.
• Measurement of transferrin is also used in calculating urine selectivity
(see ‘Urine selectivity’, p.471).

469

470

CHAPTER 17

Immunochemistry

Urine electrophoresis and
immunoﬁxation
• Units: not applicable.
• Normal range: no protein detectable.

Principles of test
• See ‘Serum electrophoresis and immunoﬁxation’, p.467.
• Random urine is usually satisfactory, but a 24-hour urine is more
sensitive. It used to be necessary to concentrate urine prior to
electrophoresis, but modern electrophoretic systems have increased
sensitivity which has rendered this step unnecessary.

Indications
• This is the screening test to detect free light chains in the urine. SFLC
is an alternative test and may replace urine electrophoresis in due
course.

Interpretation
• Monoclonal free light chains are associated with myeloma,
Waldenström’s macroglobulinaemia, and rarely lymphoma.
• Polyclonal free light chains may be found in the urine when there is
renal tubular damage, and as a consequence of old age and chronic
inﬂammatory conditions (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis).
• Interpretation of urine electrophoresis is difﬁcult as other discrete
proteins may be present that give an appearance similar to monoclonal
light chains. In particular, prostatic proteins may appear in the urine in
older men and give a step-ladder appearance of bands running in the
B-G region.
• Immunoﬁxation is essential to conﬁrm the nature of any discrete
bands found in the urine.
• It is likely that SFLC will gradually replace this test, as SLFC are more
sensitive and can be quantitated.

Urine free light chains
• Units: g/L.
• Normal ranges: not detectable.

Principles of test
• Usually by nephelometry/turbidimetry.

Indications for testing
• Patients with known or suspected Bence-Jones myeloma (producing
only light chains).
• Serial monitoring for known patients.

VIRAL ANTIBODIES

Interpretation
• There is no generally accepted technique in use.
• Nephelometric assays use antisera that are calibrated for use mainly
against bound, not free, light chains, and in serum, not urine, so it is
necessary to make an arithmetic correction.
• This is based on some assumptions, including that one-sixth of the
mass of intact immunoglobulin is light chain, that all the light chain
is either free or bound, but not both, and that if there is whole Ig, it
contains only one type of light chain.
• The correction is to multiply the nephelometric result by 0.17. In
urines where both free κ and free λ are detected the κ:λ ratio should
be in the range 1.0-4.0. Values outside this range are highly suggestive
of the presence of excess free light chains.
• Abnormal renal function, which may itself be caused by the free
light chains, will render the test unusable for serial monitoring as the
disease progresses.
• Alternatives to nephelometry for light-chain quantitation include
scanning densitometry, but this is less accurate in urine than in serum,
unless there is signiﬁcant proteinuria.
• Serum free light chains are a more accurate measure, although
correction for renal function is required. SFLC should replace urinary
quantitation.

Urine selectivity (IgG and transferrin)
• This test may be useful for determining whether the predominant
protein in the urine is low molecular weight (as may occur in minimal
change disease) or includes higher molecular weight proteins.
• IgG and transferrin are measured and the urine-to-serum ratio of
IgG is divided by the urine-to-serum ratio of transferrin to give the
selectivity.
• A value >0.15 indicates ‘non-selective’ proteinuria and is against a
diagnosis of minimal change disease.
• This test is only reliable if proteinuria >1g/L is present.
• It is no longer widely requested by renal physicians.

Viral antibodies
• See under ‘Bacterial and viral antibodies’, p.442.
• Antibodies against exposure and immunization viral antigens should
form part of the work-up of patients suspected of having a humoral
immune deﬁciency.
• Absence of detectable antibodies in patients who have a clear
exposure or immunization history is highly suspicious.
• The panel should include measles, mumps, rubella, chickenpox, herpes
simplex, EBV, CMV, polio, and hepatitis A and B.

471

472

CHAPTER 17

Immunochemistry

• It is important only to select those where exposure/immunization is
documented.
1 Remember that test immunization with live vaccines is contraindicated
in suspected immunodeﬁciency!

Viscosity
• Units: as a ratio.
• Normal adult range: 1.4-1.9 (ratio to water).

Principles of test
• A manual viscometer which compares ﬂuid ﬂow of patient sample
against water between two reservoirs connected by a capillary tube is
used for single measurements.
• Measurement of viscosity has replaced measurement of the ESR
as a general acute-phase test in many laboratories, as automated
viscometers are available.
• Conversely, many laboratories no longer have the facility to measure
viscosity.

Indications
• Measurement of serum viscosity is helpful in monitoring
Waldenström’s macroglobulinaemia and other myelomas where
hyperviscosity occurs.

Interpretation
• Hyperviscosity may lead to serious end-organ damage if undetected.
Cardiac failure, cerebral infarction, retinal vein occlusion, and renal
failure are the major complications.
• IgA myelomas are prone to develop hyperviscosity because the
IgA paraprotein frequently polymerizes in vivo. This is detected on
electrophoresis as a step-ladder of multiple bands.
• If a cryoglobulin is present, the viscosity must be measured under
warm conditions.
• Serial monitoring is helpful, particularly when plasmapheresis is being
undertaken.
• However, viscosity is NOT an appropriate acute-phase monitor, as the
dynamic range is tiny.

INTRODUCTION

Introduction
There are many hundreds of reported autoantibodies, not all of clinical
value. The repertoire of the typical regional immunology laboratory will
cover most of those described below. Some will only be available through
specialist referral laboratories or research laboratories.
When requesting tests, the following criteria should be used.
• Decide in advance what clinically useful information will be obtained
by carrying out the test.
• Because a test is available does not mean that it is of value under a
given circumstance.
• If a test result does not affect clinical management in any way, testing is
of no value.
Autoantibodies are divided broadly into two categories.
• Organ-speciﬁc, where the target antigen has a restricted distribution,
usually limited to one organ such as the thyroid gland.
• Organ-speciﬁc, where the target antigen has a wide distribution.
• Organ-non-speciﬁc antibodies may be associated with a disease of
restricted organ involvement, e.g. primary biliary cirrhosis.
• Target antigen is in the mitochondria, which are widely distributed,
but disease is limited to the liver.
• It is not clear why autoantibodies to a widely distributed antigen
should be associated with an organ-speciﬁc disease.
• It is now known that in some circumstances autoantibodies may
cross intact cell membranes. Tissue-restricted passage may explain
selective effects.
Autoantibodies may also be divided into two categories.
• Primary pathogenic antibodies, where the antibody mediates a
functional effect by:
• interfering with a cellular or molecular function (e.g. blocking
neuromuscular transmission by antibodies to the acetylcholine
receptor on muscle endplates).
• direct damage to tissues (e.g. anti-glomerular basement membrane
antibodies).
• Views on pathogenicity will be modiﬁed in the light of known
penetration of whole antibodies into intact cells.
• Secondary antibodies, which are not directly involved in the disease
process, are markers for the existence of the process (e.g. antithyroglobulin antibodies).
• These may still be useful diagnostic tools.
Not all autoantibodies are diagnostically useful, as they may have low sensitivity and speciﬁcity, e.g.
• rheumatoid factor
• gliadin antibodies.

CHAPTER 18

Autoantibodies

Techniques: overview
Multiple techniques may be available to test for individual autoantibodies.
• Comparison of different assays is often lacking.
• Results may vary between different laboratories.
• EQA may be widely discrepant.
• No gold standard assay may be identiﬁed.
Establishment of a new test require the following.:
• Review of existing methods (if any).
• Evaluation by comparison with other assays:
• tested in healthy controls
• disease state
• other confounding disease states.
• Calculation of sensitivity and speciﬁcity.
• Validation of clinical utility.
• Establishment of internal QC material.
• Validation against national/international standard reference material.
• Participation in external QA (if available).
• Evaluation of cost-beneﬁt.
Diagnostic laboratories may use in-house or commercial assays.
• Commercial assays must be CE (Conformité Européenne) marked (EU
regulations).
• Cost of CE marking has led manufacturers to withdraw low-volume
commercial assays, restricting availability.
• In-house assays may apply for CE marking.
• This requires evidence of utility, a large application form, and
money!
• Non-CE-marked assays may not be sold for proﬁt, but may be used
within the NHS.

Type of antibodies
• Autoantibodies can be of any class.
• In most circumstances IgG antibodies are usually sought.
• IgM autoantibodies are not normally signiﬁcant unless persistent and of
high titre.
• IgM anti-cardiolipin antibodies are considered signiﬁcant.
• IgA autoantibodies are rare but may be diagnostically useful, e.g.
• coeliac disease—IgA endomysial antibodies have the highest
sensitivity and speciﬁcity.
• Value of other IgA autoantibodies is unclear, e.g.
• IgA rheumatoid factors
• IgA ANCA (HSP?).
• Autoantibodies commonly appear after infections, e.g.
• EBV
• adenovirus
• HIV
• acute and chronic bacterial infections
• They will usually disappear after 6 months
• They are not usually associated with clinical disease.

IMMUNOPRECIPITATION ASSAYS

• Most common associations:
• rheumatoid factor—any infection
• anti-nuclear antibodies—adenovirus (children), HIV, Gram-negative
bacteria
• smooth muscle antibodies—adenovirus
• liver-kidney microsomal antibodies—HCV
• cardiolipin antibodies—EBV
• dsDNA antibodies—rare, HIV.
• Drugs may also induce autoantibodies. These may cause disease and
may persist after the drug is withdrawn.
• Anti-nuclear antibodies (anti-histone): procainamide, hydralazine,
ACE-inhibitor, chlorpromazine, minocycline.
• Liver-kidney microsomal antibodies: tienilic acid.
• Non-M2 mitochondrial antibodies: alcohol.

Particle agglutination assays
• Technique is old and reliable.
• It is cheap, but labour-intensive.
• Use has almost disappeared, apart from low-level screening, e.g.
rheumatoid factor, DCT.
• Antigen (either pure or extract) is coated onto an inert carrier
particle, usually gelatin or latex but originally tanned red cells.
• When mixed with serum containing the appropriate antibody, the
particles are agglutinated.
• The principle is simple, but reading the endpoint of a particle
agglutination titration requires skill.
• IgM antibodies are picked up preferentially because of their pentameric
shape, which allows better cross-linking.

Immunoprecipitation assays
• These depend upon the formation of insoluble immune complexes
where an antibody encounters the optimum concentration of antigen.
• Prototype assay is the Ouchterlony double-diffusion assay.
• Antigen and antibody are added to wells cut in agar gels and
allowed to diffuse towards one another.
• Line(s) of precipitation form at the point of equivalence, indicating
the presence of an antibody against the antigen.
• The process is slow and may take up to 72 hours to form lines.
• The technique may be improved using electrolyte-containing agarose
and applying a current across the gel, forcing the antibody and antigen
together (countercurrent immunoelectrophoresis (CIE)).
• CIE is used to detect of antibodies to extractable nuclear antigens.
• Commercial assays are not available, and CIE tends to be used to
complement commercial EIA tests for ENA in specialist centres.
• It is labour-intensive and time-consuming.

477

478

CHAPTER 18

Autoantibodies

• If the immune complex formation takes place in the liquid phase, the
light-absorbing/scattering properties of the solution will be altered and
can be measured (nephelometry/turbidimetry).
• Can be used for antibody detection on automated analysers.
• Rheumatoid factor, thyroid antibodies.
• Stability of the immune complex may be poor, and agents such as
PEG may be added to ensure a stable reaction.
• PEG can also be used in gels to enhance and stabilize the immune
complex.

Indirect immunoﬂuorescence
Tissue preparation
• Standard technique for the detection of many serum autoantibodies.
• Appropriate tissue block is snap-frozen and cut on a cryostat to
provide sections (usually 4mm thick) that are mounted on a slide and
air-dried.
• Other ﬁxation techniques may be used under special circumstances
(e.g. acetone or ethanol).
• Similar methods can be used on cell suspensions prepared on slides
using a cytocentrifuge, e.g.
• neutrophils for ANCA
• HEp-2 cells for anti-nuclear antibodies.
• Most laboratories use commercially produced slides (CE marked). The
cost is outweighed by convenience:
• no problems sourcing animal tissues
• staff are not tied up on routine slide production
• quality control of section cutting is better.

Technique
• Slides are incubated with appropriate dilutions of test and control sera,
washed, and then incubated with anti-human immunoglobulin (isotypespeciﬁc) antiserum which is conjugated with ﬂuorescein isothiocyanate
(FITC).
• The technique allows the tissue and intracellular distribution of
autoantibody binding to be visualized.
• Alternatives may be used for FITC in the second stage, e.g. enzymes
(immunoperoxidase) that will give a colour reaction when the slides
are incubated with an appropriate substrate.
• Slides can be ﬁxed and counterstained to reveal the tissue
structure.
• An ordinary transmission light microscope is all that is required.
• Processing has an extra incubation step.

Obtaining reliable results
The following are key features that are essential to obtaining reliable
results.
• Good tissue selection and processing.

INDIRECT IMMUNOFLUORESCENCE

• Appropriate starting dilution (to avoid non-speciﬁc serum binding).
• Use of serum not plasma, as ﬁbrinogen causes non-speciﬁc
ﬂuorescence.
• Appropriate FITC-conjugated antiserum selection.
• Commercial antisera are usually used.
• There may be considerable batch-to-batch variation.
• Ratio of ﬂuorescein molecule to protein needs to be between 1
and 4.5 to give reasonable results.
• If it is too low, the intensity is inadequate.
• If it is too high, the non-speciﬁc ﬂuorescence swamps the speciﬁc
staining.
• Optimal dilution needs to be determined by a chequerboard
titration.
• New antisera are tested at serial dilutions on standard tissue
sections incubated with serial dilutions of a standard control serum
with previously identiﬁed titre.
• Appropriate internal/external controls (quantitative as well as
qualitative).
• A good-quality ﬂuorescence microscope, properly maintained, with a
properly adjusted light source.
• An experienced microscopist who is familiar with the relevant
patterns.

Tissue multiblock
For laboratory convenience, it is standard practice to test for the basic
autoantibodies using a tissue multiblock containing liver, stomach, and kidney (some laboratories also include thyroid), usually rat.
• Commercial slides may have ‘chips’ containing the separate tissues and
HEp-2 cells. This allows the detection of:
• most anti-nuclear antibodies
• smooth muscle antibodies
• mitochondrial antibdies
• reticulin antibodies—these are not usually reported but may
indicate need to check endomysial or tissue transglutaminase
antibodies
• gastric parietal cell antibodies
• ribosomal antibodies
• liver-kidney microsomal (LKM) antibodies.
• HEp-2 cells allow detection of cellular staining patterns.
• HEp-2000 cells have been genetically engineered to express higher
levels of Ro antigens: in practice there is little difference.
• The disadvantage of the multiblock screen is that it encourages
clinicians to request ‘autoantibody screens’ without thinking about
what they are speciﬁcally looking for.
• Always encourage clinicians to request the test they need for diagnosis.

Screening and titration
• Screening is carried out at a single dilution with a conjugated antiserum
that recognizes IgG, IgA, and IgM (polyvalent):
• normal adult screening dilution is 1/20.

479

480

CHAPTER 18

Autoantibodies

• Positive samples are then titrated using a monospeciﬁc anti-IgG
antiserum:
• a limited number of steps only are required (twofold dilutions to
1/640; anything higher reported >1/640).
• Screening dilutions need to be adjusted in children; 1/10 may be
appropriate.
• Not all antibodies need to be titrated (e.g. GPC, reticulin).
• Titration is only semi-quantitative.

Other tissues
Same techniques as used for other tissues are used.
• Monkey oesophagus (endomysial, epidermal antibodies).
• Other tissues used are pancreas, adrenal, gonad, small intestine,
pituitary, cerebellum, cerebrum, salivary gland.

Alternative techniques
• Some laboratories are now using laser-based array systems or
automated EIA screening tools for multiple antigens to weed out
negative samples.
• Array systems are also used to screen for extractable nuclear antigens.
• These supplement but do not replace indirect immunoﬂuorescence
(IIF).
• Performance characteristics are variable.
• Systems are available for automation of the dilution and staining of
slides.

Direct immunoﬂuorescence
• This technique is very similar to that used for indirect
immunoﬂuorescence, i.e. tissue is obtained directly from the patient,
snap-frozen, and sectioned prior to incubation with the FITCconjugated antiserum.
• This allows the detection of tissue-bound antibody in the patient.
• Tissue-bound antibody may be present even when there is insufﬁcient
antibody to be detected free in the serum.
• Other tissue reactants such as complement and ﬁbrinogen may be
detected. Patterns of reaction may be absolutely diagnostic, e.g. in
bullous skin diseases.
• Direct immunoﬂuorescence is used extensively in the diagnosis of skin
diseases (because of the accessibility of the tissue for biopsy) and renal
disease.

Radio-immunoassay (RIA)
•
•
•
•

These assays are highly sensitive.
They require pure antigen.
They require radio-isotopes.
Few assays are now done using these techniques as laboratories move
away from isotopic tests to enzyme-linked immunoassays.

IMMUNOBLOTTING

• RIA is the gold standard for:
• acetylcholine receptor antibodies
• ds-DNA antibodies (Farr assay).
• RIA is also used for intrinsic factor antibodies.

Enzyme-linked (EIA) and ﬂuorescent
immunoassays (FIA)
• These have taken over from RIA, and to some extent from indirect
immunoﬂuorescence.
• Antigen is bound on to a solid phase (bead or plate) which is reacted
with serum, washed, and reacted with the antiserum against human
immunoglobulin, which is coupled to either an enzyme (EIA) or a
ﬂuorescent dye (FIA).
• The ﬁnal stage in EIA is reaction with the substrate, either directly
or via an ampliﬁcation step, to give a colour that can be measured
spectrophotometrically.
• In FIA, the plate can be read directly using an appropriate exciting
light source (which will be of a different wavelength to the emitted
light).
• Assays tend to be more sensitive than immunoﬂuorescence, but may
lose speciﬁcity.
• Pure antigen is required; the source may be critical to value of tests.
• Recombinant human tissue transglutaminase (tTG) gives better
results than guinea pig tTG.
• Commercial assays tend to be expensive.
• Samples may need to be run in duplicate, increasing cost.
• Assays are most cost-effective and accurate when performed on
automated instruments.
• Results may differ from those obtained by other methods:
• dsDNA antibodies by Farr and EIA
• ENA antibodies by CIE and EIA.
• The clinical signiﬁcance of the different results has not always been
established.
• Differences need to be considered when introducing new tests.
• External quality assurance scheme data may help in comparing
methods.

Immunoblotting
• Antigens are either electrophoresed in a matrix or applied to the
matrix at speciﬁc points, incubated with appropriate dilutions of sera,
washed, then incubated with enzyme conjugated antisera, followed by
substrate. This gives a coloured band.
• Assays are often quick, and suitable for urgent screening.
• Staining may be automated (slide-based kits).
• Results are qualitative.

481

482

CHAPTER 18

Autoantibodies

• Commercial kits are available for qualitative detection of antibodies:
• ENA
• ANCA antigens (PR3, MPO)
• liver antigens (M2, LKM, SLA, LC)
• neuronal antigens
• gangliosides.

Acetylcholine-receptor antibodies
(AChRAb)
• Units: mol/L.
• Normal ranges: <2×10-10 mol/L.

Principles of test
• Antibodies are detected by a quantitative competitive
radio-immunoassay.
• No EQA scheme exists.

Indications for testing
• AChRAbs are the marker for myasthenia gravis.

Interpretation
• Two types of antibodies have been described:
• those binding to the receptor at sites distinct from the binding site
for acetylcholine
• those blocking the binding of the neurotransmitter or
A-bungarotoxin.
• Some antibodies are capable of modulating the removal of the
receptors from the surface of the muscle through cross-linking
followed by internalization.
• Levels above 5×10-10mol/L are regarded as positive.
• Levels of 2-5×10-10mol/L are regarded as equivocal, and may be seen
in ocular myasthenia.
• Some laboratories report the levels only semi-quantitatively (high, low,
etc.).
• Highest levels are seen in young patients (<40 years with generalized
disease).
• Lower levels are seen in:
• older patients
• thymoma
• penicillamine-induced myasthenia.
• Approximately 15% of typical myasthenic patients are negative for
AChRAb.
• Some may have IgM antibodies (not detected in routine assays).
• In ocular myasthenia, about 20% of patients will be seronegative.
• Antibodies persist in 60% of patients even if the disease is in remission.

ADRENAL CORTEX AUTOANTIBODIES

• AChRAbs have also been detected in the myasthenic syndrome
associated with penicillamine usage (about 1% of treated patients).
These antibodies disappear when the drug is stopped.
• Very rarely, they may appear transiently during the immunological
reconstitution phase of bone marrow transplantation.

Actin antibodies
See ‘Smooth muscle antibodies’, p.526.

Adrenal cortex autoantibodies
• Units: qualitative.
• Normal adult range: not detected.

Principles of test
• IIF, using a multiblock of primate adrenal gland, ovary, testis, and
pituitary.
• EIA or RIA are used to look at individual antigensin the research
setting.
• No EQA scheme exists.
• Commercial positive control sera are available.

Indications for testing
• Suspected Addison’s disease.
• Screening in polyglandular syndromes.

Interpretation
• Autoantibodies to adrenal cortex (any or all of the three layers)
are found in approximately 50% of patients with Addisonian adrenal
insufﬁciency where there are other autoimmune diseases.
• Prevalence drops when the autoimmune adrenalitis occurs alone.
• They are virtually never found in patients with tuberculous adrenal
destruction.
• Target antigen is usually adrenal microsomes.
• Antibodies to the ACTH receptor have also been described in a few
patients with Cushing’s syndrome (paralleling thyroid-stimulating
antibodies).
• 21-hydroxylase (P450c21) is the major target antigen in Addison’s
disease and type I APGS.
• Frequent cross-reactivity of the antibodies with the steroid-producing
cells of the theca interna of the ovary (ovarian failure) and the Leydig
cells of the testis.
• Other antigenic enzymes in steroid-producing cells include the P450
side-chain cleavage enzyme (P450scc) and 17A-hydroxylase (P450c17).
• P450c17 antibodies are associated with type I autoimmune
polyendocrinopathy syndrome.

483

484

CHAPTER 18

Autoantibodies

• P450c21 antibodies are associated with type II autoimmune
polyendocrinopathy syndrome.
• P450scc antibodies are associated with premature ovarian failure.
• Autoimmune adrenal disease is closely associated with other organspeciﬁc autoimmune disease:
• thyrogastric (Schmidt’s syndrome).
• parathyroid autoimmune disease.
• It is important to screen for thyroid antibodies and gastric parietal
cell antibodies as well.
• Multiple endocrine autoantibodies may be found in chronic
mucocutaneous candidiasis with endocrinopathy.
• Screening such patients is important, as the autoantibodies may
appear before overt manifestations of endocrine insufﬁciency.

Amphiphysin antibodies
• Anti-amphysin antibodies bind widely to presynaptic terminals in the
brain, giving variable cytoplasmic staining.
• Association is with a range of neurological disorders including:
• subacute sensory neuropathy
• sensorimotor peripheral neuropathy
• paraneoplastic stiff person syndrome.
• Commonly associated tumours are small cell lung cancer and breast
cancer.

Anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA) and ANCA
Anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA)
See ‘Nuclear antibodies (ANA)’, p.514.

ANCA
See ‘Neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA)’, p.512.

Aquaporin antibodies
• IgG antibodies to aquaporin 4 are found in neuromyelitis optica
(Devic’s disease), a demyelinating disease with some similarities to
multiple sclerosis.
• Also known as NMO-IgG.
• Found in 60-70% of patients and is a predictor of subsequent relapse.

Auerbach’s plexus antibodies
• Antibodies against the myenteric plexus of the oesophagus have been
reported to be detected by immunoﬂuorescence in patients with
achalasia of the cardia, a motility disorder of the oesophagus.
• The diagnostic role of these antibodies remains to be conﬁrmed.

CARDIOLIPIN ANTIBODIES (ACA) AND LUPUS ANTICOAGULANT

β2-GPI antibodies
• These antibodies have been reported as part of the anti-phospholipid
antibody spectrum (see ‘Cardiolipin antibodies (ACA) and lupus
anticoagulant’, p.485).
• Provided that anti-cardiolipin antibody assays include B2-GPI as a
cofactor, there is no clinical indication for separate measurement of
anti-B2-GPI antibodies.
• Some patients with the anti-phospholipid syndrome, negative for
ACA and with a normal dRVVT, are positive for B2-GPI antibodies.
• Also seen with M5 anti-mitochondrial antibodies.

C1q antibodies
• Antibodies to C1q have been described in hypocomplementaemic
urticarial vasculitis, rheumatoid vasculitis, and SLE.
• 70% of patients with Felty’s syndrome are positive for C1q
antibodies.
• IgA anti-C1q is found in rheumatoid vasculitis.
• In SLE, quantitative measurement of C1q antibodies is now thought to
be a measure of the activity of renal disease.
• Antibodies to the neoantigen formed by activation of C1q have also
been associated with types of glomerulonephritis.
• EIA assays are available commercially.
• There is no EQA scheme at present.

Cardiac antibodies
• These antibodies are positive in:
• a proportion of patients with Dressler’s syndrome after myocardial
infarction
• cardiac surgery
• some cardiomyopathies
• after acute rheumatic fever.
• Multiple antigens have been identiﬁed.
• Diagnostic value is low.
• Detected by immunoﬂuorescence.

Cardiolipin antibodies (ACA) and lupus
anticoagulant
• Units: GPLU/mL; MPLU.
• Normal adult range:
• IgG, <10 GPLU/mL (10-20 borderline);
• IgM, <10 MPLU/mL (10-20 borderline).

485

486

CHAPTER 18

Autoantibodies

Principles of testing
•
•
•
•

EIA.
International standards exist for IgG and IgM ACA.
A UK speciﬁc standard exists for IgG ACA.
An EQA scheme exists in the UK.

Indications for testing
• Suspected anti-phospholipid syndrome:
• recurrent DVT/PE (as part of thrombophilia screen), major arterial
and venous thrombosis
• recurrent miscarriages
• premature stroke, multi-infarct dementia
• severe and/or atypical migraine
• vasculitis (Behçet’s syndrome)
• connective tissue disease (SLE, Sjögren’s syndrome)
• livedo reticularis
• Sneddon’s syndrome (cerebral events and livedo)
• Budd-Chiari syndrome
2 Testing must include both ACA and a test for lupus anticoagulant:
• either or both may be present
• clinical signiﬁcance is the same whichever is present.

Interpretation
• Antibodies to cardiolipin form part of the spectrum of antiphospholipid antibodies.
• Other related antibodies include:
• false-positive VDRL
• lupus anticoagulants
• antibodies to derived phospholipids.
• Standardization and reproducibility of the assays continue to be a
major problem.
• This is related in part to the requirement for B2-GPI
(apolipoprotein H) from serum as a cofactor for the binding of
cardiolipin antibodies.
• Autoantibodies have also been detected to the cofactor itself.
• The cofactor binds anionic phospholipids in vivo and its normal
function is to inhibit coagulation and platelet aggregation.
• Presence of ACA may be found in the conditions listed in ‘Indications
for testing’.
• There is no strong correlation with premature myocardial infarction
or with cerebral lupus (despite the fact that the brain is full of
phospholipid!).
• Symptoms are mainly associated with IgG-class antibodies.
• Rare patients with typical symptoms will be encountered who have
only IgM-class antibodies, and never make IgG antibodies.
• Amount of the antibody in units does not seem to relate to the
severity of the disease.
• Immunosuppression does not have a signiﬁcant effect on the level of
ACA and does not affect thrombophilic tendency.

CENTROMERE (KINETOCHORE) ANTIBODIES

• Transient positive antibodies may be found after viral infections
(especially EBV).
• Anti-phospholipid antibodies associated with syphilis and other
infections do not usually react with B2-GPI and are rarely associated
with a clotting disorder.
• Lupus anticoagulants are antibodies that interfere with the clotting
process in vitro and are usually detected by prolongation of the APTT:
• test of choice is dilute Russell viper venom test (dRVVT).
• Although it has been suggested that lupus anticoagulants are more
speciﬁc for recurrent fetal loss than cardiolipin antibodies, both may
be associated with the syndrome.
• Women with lupus who are planning pregnancy should be screened
for both anti-cardiolipin antibodies and lupus anticoagulants, in addition
to testing for anti-Ro antibodies.

Cartilage antibodies
• Antibodies to collagens types I, II, and III have been found in a range of
inﬂammatory conditions where there is cartilage damage, including:
• rheumatoid arthritis
• relapsing polychondritis (collagen type II, 60% of patients positive)
• a range of other connective tissue diseases, e.g. juvenile RhA
(30-40%).
• Speciﬁcity is low and they are of little diagnostic value.

Centriole antibodies
• Centriole antibodies will only be detected if HEp-2 cells are used as
the substrate for ANA detection.
• Immunoﬂuorescence will show two brightly staining polar dots.
• Found very rarely in patients with scleroderma and related overlap
syndromes.
• May also occur commonly in mycoplasmal pneumonia.

Centromere (kinetochore) antibodies
• Units: qualitative.
• Normal adult range: not detected.

Principles of testing
• Detected by immunoﬂuorescence on HEp-2 cells.
• It is essential that the HEp-2 cells contain adequate numbers of dividing
cells.
• EIA and immunoblot assays are available for three main antigens:
CENP-A, CENP-B, CENP-C.

487

488

CHAPTER 18

Autoantibodies

Indications for testing
• Indicated in patients with suspected scleroderma, Raynaud’s
phenomenon, cutaneous calcinosis.
• Patients with severe Raynaud’s phenomenon and features of
scleroderma should also be screened for the ENA Scl-70, associated
with progressive systemic sclerosis (PSS).

Interpretation
• Antibodies can only be detected on HEp-2 cells.
• Also referred to as kinetochore antibodies as they react with antigens
located at the inner and outer kinetochore plates.
• Antigens are 17, 80, and 140kDa proteins involved in the attachment of
the spindle ﬁbres (CENP-A, CENP-B, CENP-C).
• Minor centromere antigens may also be targets (CENP-D, CENP-E,
CENP-F).
• CENP-B appears to be the predominant antigen, with ﬁve epitopes,
some of which are shared with CENP-A and CENP-C.
• Antibodies show diagnostic condensation of ﬂuorescence along the
metaphase plate in dividing cells, which distinguishes the staining from
other speckled-pattern ANA.
• Found in the CREST syndrome (sometimes referred to as limited
scleroderma):
• about 70-80% of patients with features of CREST will have anticentromere antibodies
• 1% of patients with PSS will be positive.
• Detection of anti-centromere antibodies is of prognostic signiﬁcance.
• Titration of centromere antibodies is of no value.
• Scl-70 and anti-centromere antibodies seem to be mutually exclusive.
• Up to 12% of patients with primary biliary cirrhosis may be positive for
anti-centromere antibodies, of whom about half will have clinical signs
of scleroderma.
• This may be a misinterpretation of the immunoﬂuorescence pattern,
as M2-antibody-negative PBC is often positive for a pattern of multiple
nuclear dots (see ‘Multiple nuclear dot antibody’, p.509), which is
sometimes referred to as pseudo-centromere because of its resemblance
to centromere staining. However, the metaphase plate is not stained.

Cold agglutinins
• Often confused with cryoglobulins.
• They are autoantibodies that reversibly agglutinate erythrocytes in the
cold.
• Cause small vessel obstruction in the skin of the extremities, Raynaud’s
phenomenon, and haemolytic anaemia.
• Most common speciﬁcity is anti-i but other speciﬁcities such as anti-I
or anti-Pr occur.
• Often triggered by infections:
• Mycoplasma pneumoniae
• Rickettsia

CCP, CYTOKERATIN, AND DESMIN ANTIBODIES

•
•

•

•

• Listeria monocytogenes
• EBV.
Usually polyclonal IgMκ, although EBV may be associated with a
polyclonal IgMλ anti-i response.
May also occur in association with lymphoproliferative diseases where
the agglutinin is usually monoclonal (invariably IgMκ):
• typically a disease of the elderly
• cold agglutinins may precede the overt development of lymphoma
by many years.
Paroxysmal cold haemoglobinuria is associated with anti-P antibody:
• binds to the red cell and ﬁxes complement in the cold
• red cell lysis takes place when the cell is rewarmed
• rare, and originally described in association with syphilis (Donath-
Landsteiner antibody)
• more commonly associated with viral infections such as mumps,
measles, and chickenpox.
As for cryoglobulins, samples must be taken and transported to the
laboratory at 37°C.

CV2/CRMP5 antibodies
• Antibodies recognize the collapsin response-mediator brain protein
(CRMP) family; CRMP5 is the dominant antigen.
• Staining is seen in the cytoplasm of oligodendrocytes
• Associated with small cell lung cancer (SCLC) in 77% and thymoma in
6%.
• Syndrome can include:
• subacaute sensory neuropathy
• limbic encephalopathy
• cereballar ataxia
• extra-pyramidal syndromes
• myopathy.
• Presence of antibodies to CV2/CRMP5 in SCLC is associated with
better prognosis than anti-Hu antibodies.

Cyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP),
cytokeratin, and desmin antibodies
Cyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP) antibodies
• Rheumatoid arthritis has been associated with antibodies to
perinuclear factor, keratin, and ﬁlaggrin on buccal mucosa and rat
oesophagus by immunoﬂuorescence.
• A synthetic peptic (CCP) can be used in EIA to detect these
antibodies.
• Speciﬁcity for RhA is said to be 96%.
• It is being increasingly used for early diagnosis of RhA.

489

490

CHAPTER 18

Autoantibodies

Cytokeratin antibodies
• Antibodies to cytokeratin 18 are non-speciﬁc and associated with:
• rheumatoid arthritis
• psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis
• Crohn’s disease
• coronary artery disease.
• They are identiﬁed by IIF on HEp-2 cells.

Desmin antibodies
• Antibodies to desmin are non-speciﬁc and associated with:
• autoimmune hepatitis
• PBC
• coronary artery disease
• Crohn’s disease.
• They are identiﬁed by IIF on HEp-2 cells.

dsDNA antibodies
• Units: IU/mL.
• Normal adult range:
• negative, <30IU/mL
• borderline, 30-50IU/mL
• positive, 50-300IU/mL
• strongly positive, >300IU/mL
• may vary according to assay.

Principles of testing
• Gold standard remains Farr assay (RIA): highly speciﬁc and sensitive.
• dsDNA is precipitated using ammonium sulphate.
• High-avidity antibodies are detected.
• EIA assays are available: results may not be concordant with Farr assay
because of presence of ssDNA and z-DNA.
• EIA assays are very sensitive but not always speciﬁc.
• Low-avidity antibodies of no clinical signiﬁcance may be detected.
• Staining of the kinetoplast of Crithidia lucilae is speciﬁc but not
sensitive. It cannot be recommended as a screening test.

Indications for testing
• Suspected connective tissue disease.
• Suspected autoimmune hepatitis.
• Follow-on test when homogeneous or peripheral ﬂuorescent antinuclear antibodies detected.

Interpretation
• Test is conﬁrmatory for SLE.
• Only antibodies to dsDNA are measured.
• Elevated levels occur predominantly in SLE, but also in ‘lupoid’ chronic
active hepatitis.

ENA ANTIBODIES

• Antibodies are not found in other connective tissue diseases or in all
patients with SLE.
• Because the antibodies have a circulating half-life of 3 weeks, serial
measurements are not useful for monitoring the activity of SLE.
• A rising titre may predict clinical relapse, and treatment on a rising
titre before symptoms reappear may reduce the total amount of
immunosuppression required.
• Titre of high-avidity antibody may be associated with progression of
renal disease.

ssDNA antibodies
• Antibodies to single-stranded DNA and other forms (z-DNA) occur in
a wide range of connective tissue diseases.
• They have a low sensitivity and speciﬁcity.
• Antibodies to ssDNA may occur in drug-induced lupus as well as
idiopathic lupus.
• Other diseases in which there is a high prevalence of anti-ssDNA
antibodies are:
• rheumatoid arthritis
• scleroderma
• polymyositis.
• The antibodies reduce the sensitivity and speciﬁcity of EIA assays
for dsDNA because the substrate in assays for the latter may be
contaminated with ssDNA produced during the puriﬁcation process.
• A number of commercial assays have been shown to be contaminated
in this way, leading to erroneous diagnoses of lupus on the basis of
false-positive reports of antibodies to dsDNA.
• Assays for antibodies to ssDNA have no clinical role but are used for
quality control of assays to dsDNA.

ENA antibodies
• Units: qualitative.
• Normal adult range: see individual antigens.

Principles of testing
• No gold standard test available.
• Originally detected by countercurrent immunoelectrophoresis of
serum against saline extracts of cells (thymus, spleen).
• Other techniques include:
• Ouchterlony double diffusion
• immunoblotting
• EIA.
• More than one technique may be required to identify relevant speciﬁcities.
• EIA assays have increased sensitivity compared to CIE and double
diffusion. The clinical signiﬁcance of this is uncertain.
• Testing should include a six-antigen screen (including Scl-70 and Jo-1).
Four-antigen screening is not adequate.

CHAPTER 18

Autoantibodies

• EQA and international standards exist.
• EQA performance can be quite diverse, depending on assays used.

Indications for testing
• Suspected connective tissue disease.
• Investigation of congenital complete heart block.
• Follow-up testing when high-titre speckled ANA detected by IIF.

Interpretation
• These antibodies recognize saline-extracted cellular antigens and cause
speckled ANA staining.
• Six major speciﬁcities are tested for routinely:
• anti-Ro (associated with Sjögren’s, SLE, cutaneous lupus, neonatal
lupus, and congenital complete heart block)
• anti-La (associated with Sjögren’s, SLE, and neonatal lupus)
• anti-Sm (speciﬁc for SLE, but common only in West Indians)
• anti-RNP (associated with SLE and, when occurring alone, said to
identify mixed connective tissue disease)
• anti-Scl-70 (associated with progressive systemic sclerosis)
• anti-Jo-1 (associated with polymyositis and dermatomyositis).
• The individual antibodies are discussed separately.
• Many other speciﬁcities have been identiﬁed. Clinical utility is variable.
• Where a high-titre speckled ANA is seen but the 6-antigen screen
is negative, further investigation by alternative methods may be
appropriate if clinically indicated.

Endomysial antibodies (EMA)
• Units: qualitative.
• Normal adult range: negative.

Principles of testing
• IIF for IgA EMA on primate oesophagus (preferred substrate) or
human umbilical vein.
• Gradually being replaced by EIA for antibodies to tTG (see ‘Tissue
transglutaminase (tTG) antibodies’, p.530).
• IgA EMA may be a better screening test that IgA tTG.
• IgA tTG may be better for long-term follow-up.
• Testing should include a screen for IgA deﬁciency (increased in coeliac
disease).
• Nephelometric assays do not conﬁrm IgA deﬁciency at the lowest
detection levels.
• Ouchterlony double diffusion is more sensitive.
• IgG EMA should be sought in IgA-deﬁcient patients.

Indications for testing
• Suspected coeliac disease.
• Suspected dermatitis herpetiformis.
• NICE also recommends regular screening of all children with type I
IDDM on an annual basis.

ENDOTHELIAL ANTIBODIES

• Any patient with small bowel lymphoma must be screened.
• Monitoring known coeliac patients for dietary compliance.
• NICE have recommended the use of tTG assays for screening in
primary care, but this test is too sensitive and generates a lot of false
positives who then have to undergo a small intestinal biopsy.

Interpretation
• IgA-EMA will be positive in 60-70% of patients with dermatitis
herpetiformis and 100% of untreated coeliac patients.
• Monitoring of IgA-EMA is valuable in conﬁrming adherence to a glutenfree diet (GFD), as the antibody disappears, along with anti-gliadin
antibodies, on a GFD and returns if there is a gluten challenge, even in
the absence of overt symptoms.
• IgA EMA and IgA tTG give entirely comparable results.
• Sensitivity and speciﬁcity of IgA EMA and IgA tTG mean that jejunal
biopsy is no longer compulsory.
• Antibodies may be detected in patients without biopsy evidence of
villous atrophy. These patients may be in the early stage of disease.
Outcome of early intervention with gluten-free diet is unknown.
• IgA EMA and IgA tTG may be negative in children <1 year old
(incomplete development of IgA system). Testing for IgG antibodies
may be helpful (unproven).
• IgA deﬁciency increases risk of coeliac disease 15-fold.
• Patients with coeliac disease may have autoantibodies to the crypt
basement membrane of human fetal jejunum. These antibodies
appear to be of identical speciﬁcity to those detected as endomysial
antibodies.

Endothelial antibodies
• Antibodies against a variety of endothelial antigens have been
described in a variety of vasculitic syndromes:
• SLE
• rheumatoid vasculitis
• systemic sclerosis
• haemolytic uraemic syndrome
• Kawasaki syndrome
• Wegener’s granulomatosis
• microscopic polyarteritis
• during solid organ graft rejection.
• Therefore diagnostic signiﬁcance is low.
• Endothelial cell antibodies have been detected by immunoﬂuorescence
on rodent kidney, cultured human endothelial cells, and human
umbilical vein cell line (Eayh926).
• EIA and immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation have also been
used.
• Techniques have been difﬁcult to standardize.
• Titres may correlate with disease activity in vasculitis.
• Test is not routinely available and is of uncertain value clinically.

493

494

CHAPTER 18

Autoantibodies

Epidermal antibodies (including direct
immunoﬂuorescence of skin)
These antibodies are useful in the diagnosis of blistering skin diseases.

Bullous pemphigoid
• Autoantibodies are directed against the basement membrane.
• Autoantibodies recognize two keratinocyte hemi-desmosomal
proteins, BP230 and BP180.
• On DIF up to 90% of cases have typical linear IgG deposition.
• On IIF of serum only 70% will be positive (using monkey
oesophagus as a substrate).

Herpes gestationis
•
•
•
•
•

Autoantibody is directed against basement membrane.
Antigen is the BP180 protein.
IgG deposition is seen on DIF in only 25% of cases.
100% will have C3 deposition.
Serum is rarely positive.

Epidermolysis bullosa acquisita
• Autoantibody is directed against basement membrane.
• Gives linear IgG and C3 on DIF that has no distinguishing features from
other basement membrane staining.
• Diagnostic test is splitting the biopsy between the dermis and
epidermis by using high-salt incubation. Immunoﬂuorescence appears
on the dermal side.
• Antigen is type VII procollagen.

Pemphigus vulgaris
• Antibodies recognize the intercellular substance of the epidermis and
give typical chickenwire staining by DIF and IIF.
• Antigen is desmoglein-1, an intercellular adhesion molecule of the
cadherin family.

Pemphigus foliaceus
• Antibodies recognize the intercellular substance of the epidermis and
give typical chickenwire staining by DIF and IIF.
• The antigen in pemphigus foliaceus appears to be different from
pemphigus vulgaris by immunoblotting.
• The two conditions are not readily distinguishable by routine
immunoﬂuorescence.

Paraneoplastic pemphigus
• A paraneoplastic form of pemphigus has been described with
autoantibodies to desmoplakin I, a desmosomal protein.

ERYTHROCYTE ANTIBODIES

Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH)
• DH causes the deposition of granular IgA, and sometimes C3, along
the dermal papillae on DIF.
• Endomysial and gliadin antibodies may be present in serum.
• DH must be distinguished from linear IgA disease (a bullous disease).
• Linear IgA deposition, often with IgG and C3, at the dermo-epidermal
junction.

SLE
• DIF of the skin from patients with SLE usually shows coarse irregular
granular deposition of IgG, IgM, C3, and C4 along the dermoepidermal junction (lupus band test).
• Similar features may be found in chronically sun-exposed skin from
individuals without lupus.

Lichen planus
• DIF of skin from patients with lichen planus shows characteristic ﬂameshaped deposits of ﬁbrin and IgM in the epidermis.
Solid-phase assays are now available for some of the antigens. Salt-split
skin direct immunoﬂuoresence can be helpful in localizing the staining.

Erythrocyte antibodies
• Anti-red cell antibodies are investigated to test for:
• temperature of maximal activity
• speciﬁcity for red cell antigens
• complement binding
• agglutination
• haemolysis.
• This involves looking at the patient’s red cells and serum, and the
eluate of the cells.
• Cells can also be treated with enzymes to enhance reactivity with
certain antigenic systems (e.g. Ii or Pr).
• In warm haemolytic anaemia the major target antigens are those of the
rhesus system, although many other antigens have been reported as
involved.
• Warm haemolytic anaemia may be associated with idiopathic
haemolysis or be secondary to:
• SLE
• CLL
• lymphoma
• viral infections.
• In drug-induced haemolysis, there are often antibodies to drug-cell
neoantigens (e.g. quinine, penicillins, and cephalosporins).
See also ‘Cold agglutinins’, p.488.

495

496

CHAPTER 18

Autoantibodies

Ganglioside antibodies
• Antibodies to gangliosides (sialylated glycolipids which form part of the
myelin sheath) have been associated with a number of neurological
diseases.
• Diagnostic value is limited to supporting clinical diagnoses.
• Antibodies to GM1 (and asialo-GM1) and other gangliosides have been
associated with:
• Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS)
• chronic demyelinating polyneuropathy
• multifocal motor neuropathy
• paraproteinaemic neuropathies (usually monoclonal IgM with
anti-GM1 speciﬁcity)
(see Chapter 5).
• It has been suggested that the presence of anti-GM1 antibodies may be
a predictor of response to intravenous immunoglobulin.
• Anti-GD1b is associated with:
• GBS
• sensory neuropathy.
• Anti-GQ1b is associated with:
• Miller Fisher variant of GBS (external ophthalmoplegia, ataxia,
arreﬂexia)—most speciﬁcally with ophthalmoplegia
• chronic ataxic neuropathy (IgM antibodies).
• Anti-GT1a is associated with the Miller Fisher variant of GBS.
• IgM antibodies to GD1b are highly speciﬁc for a rare chronic ataxic
neuropathy termed CANOMAD.

Gastric parietal cell (GPC) antibodies
• Units: semi-quantitative.
• Normal adult range: negative.

Principles of testing
• IIF using rodent stomach (tissue multiblock).
• Heterophile antibodies (see ‘Heterophile antibodies’, p.500) may
produce false positives on human and rat stomach, but do not react on
mouse stomach.
• EIA available.
• There is no international standard.
• In the UK, EQA is provided through the General Autoimmune
Serology scheme.

Indications for testing
• Suspected pernicious anaemia.
• Most tests are done without requests as part of an ‘autoantibody
screen’.

GLIADIN ANTIBODIES (AGA)

Interpretation
• GPC antibodies are found in almost all patients with pernicious
anaemia (PA) in the early stages.
• Frequency diminishes with disease progression.
• Target autoantigens are the A- and B-subunits of the H+, K+-ATPase
(proton pump).
• Antibodies are associated with atrophic gastritis (type A).
• Antral gastritis (type B) is not associated with GPC antibodies, but may
be associated with antibodies to the gastrin-producing cells.
• GPC antibodies may be found in asymptomatic individuals. However,
about 3% per annum will go on to develop PA.
• There is a strong association of PA with thyroid disease:
• 50% of patients with PA will also have anti-thyroid antibodies
• 30% of patients with thyroiditis will have GPC antibodies.
• There is no correlation of the titre of antibody with disease.
• Antibodies to gastrin-producing cells and gastrin receptors (blocking
gastrin binding) have also been described in patients with PA (8-30%),
but these are of no routine clinical value at present.

Gliadin antibodies (AGA)
• Units: qualitative.
• Normal range: 15-20% of children have IgA antibodies to gliadin in the
absence of coeliac disease.

Principles of testing
• EIA for IgA and IgG antibodies against alcohol-soluble fraction of
gluten.

Indications for testing
• Higher sensitivity and speciﬁcity of IgA EMA and IgA tTG assays mean
that these assays are the preferred tests for gluten-sensitive enteropathy.
• Cerebellar ataxic syndromes have a possible weak association with
gliadin antibodies. Routine testing is not recommended in view of the
lack of speciﬁcity and sensitivity.

Interpretation
• Gliadin antibodies are found in coeliac disease and dermatitis
herpetiformis, but are not speciﬁc.
• AGA are also found in Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis.
• In children, IgA-AGA may be seen in cow’s milk intolerance and postinfective malabsorption.
• IgG anti-gliadin antibodies occurring alone are of no particular
diagnostic signiﬁcance, and may be present in a wide range of
inﬂammatory and infective bowel conditions.
• The sensitivity and speciﬁcity of IgA anti-gliadin antibodies are
approximately 100% and 95%, respectively, while the ﬁgures for IgG
antibodies are 50% and 60%, respectively.

497

498

CHAPTER 18

Autoantibodies

• IgA EMA and IgA tTG are the preferred tests for clinical use.
• IgA anti-gliadin antibodies are also found in IgA mesangial
glomerulonephritis, and may be useful as a diagnostic test.
• Disease itself is not affected by adherence to a GFD.
• Positive results are also seen in:
• children and adults with diabetes mellitus (type I)
• ﬁrst-degree relatives of patients with coeliac disease
• patients with Down’s syndrome (increased risk of developing
coeliac disease).
See ‘Endomysial antibodies (EMA)’, p.492 and ‘Tissue transglutaminase
(tTG) antibodies’, p.530.

Glomerular basement membrane
antibodies
• Units:
• usually qualitative
• quantitative assays available through PRUs.
• Normal adult range: not detectable.

Principles of testing
• Test of choice is EIA, using C-terminal peptide of type IV collagen.
• IIF assays using rodent, primate of group O human kidney are not
recommended because of high rate of false-positive and false-negative
reactions:
• only 75% of proven cases will show positive IIF.
• Antibodies may be detected by DIF of biopsies of kidney and
occasionally lung (linear staining on basement membrane):
• IgG and C3 will be detected
• occasionally IgA will be present.
• Quantitation is useful when plasmapheresis is undertaken.
• An EQA scheme exists in the UK.

Indications for testing
• Investigation of rapid-onset glomerulonephritis.
• Investigation of pulmonary haemorrhage and haemoptysis.

Interpretation
• Anti-GBM antibodies are the marker for GBM disease or
Goodpasture’s syndrome.
• Antibodies are directed against the non-collagenous domains of type
IV collagen.
• There may be other target antigens (entactin/nidogen?).
• Antibodies are examples of primary pathogenic antibodies directly
involved in disease process.
• Complement ﬁxation takes place at sites of antibody localization.
• The same antigen is present in both glomerular and alveolar basement
membranes.

GLUTAMIC ACID DECARBOXYLASE (GAD) ANTIBODIES

• Alveolar haemorrhage is usually limited to patients who smoke or are
exposed to other irritants (solvent fumes).
• 10-35% of patients with anti-GBM antibodies may also have ANCAs,
with a P-ANCA pattern, usually due to myeloperoxidase antibodies.
Signiﬁcance is uncertain.
• Wegener’s granulomatosis may present with pulmonary haemorrhage
and glomerulonephritis.
• The screen for all patients with glomerulonephritis and/or pulmonary
haemorrhage must include both ANCA and GBM antibodies.
• These patients require urgent immunological investigations—one of
the few occasions on which this is necessary.

Glutamate receptor (mGluR1)
antibodies
• Identiﬁed in small numbers of patients with ataxia and cerebellar
degeneration.
• Associated with Hodgkin’s lymphoma.
• Also identiﬁed in patients with stroke and head injury.

Glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD)
antibodies
• Units: AU/mL.
• Normal adult range: negative.

Principles of testing
• EIA for GAD65 antibodies.
• Epitopes for IDDM and stiff person syndrome are different and
recognition in EIAs differs between assays.
• Antibodies to GAD67 also occur but are cross-reactive with GAD65.
• Separate assays not used clinically.
• Immunoblotting may also be used.
• No EQA or international standards.

Indications
• Suspected type I IDDM.
• Screening with islet cell antibodies may be quicker and cheaper.
• Suspected stiff person syndrome.

Interpretation
• GADI antibodies against conformational epitopes seen in IDDM.
• Only react with native GAD65.
• GADII antibodies against linear epitopes seen in stiff person syndrome.
• Anti-GAD65 antibodies have been found in >60% of patients with stiff
person syndrome.

499

500

CHAPTER 18

Autoantibodies

• It is known that the enzyme is concentrated in the GABAergic
neurons involved in the control of muscle tone.
• Antibodies to GAD67 are not found in IDDM.

Gut (enterocyte) antibodies
• Antibodies to gut epithelium may occur:
• in UC—antibodies to brush border have been described in UC and
in some patients with Yersinia enterocolitis
• in UC: antibodies to colonic goblet cells
• in intractable diarrhoea of infancy and HIV-associated diarrhoea—
antibodies to jejunal and ileal enterocytes
• in IPEX syndrome—antibodies to jejunal and ileal enterocytes
• in bile salt malabsorption—IgA ileal enterocytes
• transiently post-BMT.
• The signiﬁcance of these antibodies is uncertain.
• Detection is by IIF.

Heterophile antibodies
• These are not true ‘autoantibodies’ but represent a source of
confusion with real autoantibodies.
• They are antibodies that may normally be present in serum and bind
to tissue sections, particularly rodent tissues (see ‘Gastric parietal cell
(GPC) antibodies’, p.496).
• They are particularly common in patients who have been transfused or
allo-immunized in other ways (multiple pregnancies, organ grafts).

Histone antibodies
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Antibodies to histones are the marker for drug-induced lupus (95%).
Also seen in SLE (up to 50%).
Cause a homogeneous anti-nuclear staining pattern on IIF.
Target antigens are invariably the histones:
• H2A-H2B in procainamide-induced lupus
• Hs, H4 in hydralazine-induced lupus.
Virtually all procainamide-treated patients with lupus will have histone
antibodies.
Most cases of drug-induced lupus are negative for antibodies to
dsDNA, although antibodies to ssDNA may be present.
Commercial ELISA assays are available.
Histone antibodies can be detected by IIF after acid elution of the
cellular substrate.
It is essential to ensure that the histone is entirely free from
contaminating DNA. This is difﬁcult to do, as the DNA has to be digested
in the presence of protease inhibitors to prevent damage to the histones.
There is no EQA scheme.

INSULIN ANTIBODIES (IAA)

Hsp-90 antibodies
• Antibodies to the 90kDa mammalian heat shock protein have been
described in up to 50% of lupus patients and in a few patients with
polymyositis.
• Antigen is located in the cytoplasm and on the surface membrane.
• They are not sought routinely.

Hu antibodies
• Antibodies speciﬁc for neuronal cell nuclei (anti-Hu, ANNA)
have been described in some patients with SCLC accompanied
by paraneoplastic syndromes of sensory neuropathies or
encephalomyelitis.
• Antibodies recognize a 36-42kDa protein of neuronal nuclei, especially
of Purkinje cells, recognizing an RNA binding nuclear proteins (HuD,
HuC, Hel-N1, and Hel-N2).
• They must be distinguished from non-neuron-speciﬁc anti-nuclear
antibodies. The immunoﬂuorescence staining pattern is ﬁne speckled
on neuronal nuclei; glial cells are not stained.
• Immunoblotting and EIA may also be used to detect anti-Hu.
• Pathological signiﬁcance is uncertain as removal by plasmapheresis
does not improve disease and immunization of animals with the
antigen does not elicit disease.

Inner ear antibodies
• Rare cases of progressive deafness may be due to an autoimmune
process directed against antigens of the inner ear.
• These can be detected by immunoﬂuorescence on sections of the
inner ear (either bovine or guinea pig), although obtaining suitable
material is exceptionally difﬁcult.
• Originally it was thought that antibodies to type II collagen formed the
basis of this autoimmune process, but more recently it has been shown
that the antigen is a heat shock protein (Hsp-2).
• A commercial immunoblot system is now available for this antigen.

Insulin antibodies (IAA)
Insulin antibodies may be seen in the following.
• Type I IDDM prior to treatment (40%):
• they are seen in all young children with IDDM
• they are seen in few adults with IDDM (4%)
• they disappear with progressive islet cell destruction.
• Autoimmune polyendocrinopathies.

501

502

CHAPTER 18

Autoantibodies

• Treatment with exogenous insulins.
• Epitopes recognized differ from those found in IDDM pre-treatment.
• Autoantibodies to insulin have been described as a cause of insulin
resistance and are highly speciﬁc.
• IgE anti-insulin antibodies may be associated with allergic reactions
to administered insulin (RAST available).
• Antibodies to the insulin receptor have also been described in insulin
resistance, usually associated with acanthosis nigricans.

Insulinoma-associated
autoantibodies (IA2)
• IA2 antibodies are found in latent diabetes and type I diabetes in
combination with other antibodies (islet cell antibodies, GAD-65
antibodies, and insulin antibodies) and may provide useful predictive
information.
• The presence of three or four antibodies gives a risk of progression of
60-100%, although this may be over a long time frame.
• The optimum combination of autoantibodies is not deﬁned.

Intrinsic factor antibodies
• Units: qualitative.
• Normal adult range: negative.

Principles of testing
• RIA or EIA.
• There is currently no reliable EQA scheme or international standards.

Indications for testing
• Suspected pernicious anaemia.
• Further investigation of positive gastric parietal cell antibodies.

Interpretation
• Antibodies to intrinsic factor are highly speciﬁc for pernicious anaemia
and are found in up to 75% of patients (see Chapter 4).
• Two types of antibodies can be detected:
• type I block the binding of B12 to intrinsic factor
• type II block the uptake of the IF-B12 complex.
• Exogenous vitamin B12 interferes with RIA for type I antibodies (as the
assay is a competitive assay using radiolabelled B12).
• EIA assays have not been entirely satisfactory.
• Value of testing for IF antibodies is uncertain as the diagnosis of
pernicious anaemia depends on demonstrating abnormal uptake of B12
in a Schilling test.
• Owing to concerns about the use of human albumin and porcine
intrinsic factor in the Schilling test, the test is less widely available.

ISLET CELL ANTIBODIES (ICA)

Islet cell antibodies (ICA)
• Units: JDF units.
• Normal adult range: negative.
• >40 JDF units gives 85% PPV for diabetes.

Principles of testing
• Indirect immunoﬂuorescence using serum on human group O
pancreas.
• There is an international standard with a system of units (JDF units).
• No EQA scheme in the UK.

Indications for testing
• Suspected type I diabetes mellitus.
• Screening of ﬁrst-degree relatives.

Interpretation
• Antibodies react with both A- and B-cells:
• staining for both is seen in IDDM
• staining of B-cells alone is seen in autoimmune polyglandular
syndrome
• one of the antigens recognized is GAD65.
• May be positive when GAD antibodies are negative.
• May be found early in the course of type I diabetes mellitus.
• Detectable within ﬁrst year of diagnosis.
• >85% newly diagnosed type I diabetics are positive.
• Gradually disappear with time as islets are destroyed.
• Found in type II diabetes (5-10%).
• A small group of patients with multiple autoimmune endocrine disease
maintain their antibody levels.
• Useful for screening ﬁrst-degree relatives for risk of developing
diabetes. Their presence increases the relative risk of type I IDDM
75-fold.
• Prevalence in ﬁrst-degree relatives is 3-4%. If ICA are present and
glucose tolerance impaired >50% risk of developing diabetes within
5 years.
• There is no good evidence that quantitation offers any particularly
useful clinical information.
• The role of ICA vis-à-vis direct measurement of GAD-65, IA2, ZnT8,
and IAA in the diagnosis of type I diabetes, latent diabetes, and
screening of children with coeliac disease has not been deﬁned.

503

504

CHAPTER 18

Autoantibodies

Jo-1 and related anti-transferase
antibodies
• Antibodies are found in:
• approximately 25% of adult patients with autoimmune myositis
• 68% in patients with myositis, Raynaud’s, arthritis, and interstitial
lung disease (anti-synthetase syndrome).
• In sera containing anti-Jo-1, the anti-nuclear antibody may be negative,
without the speckled pattern seen with other antibodies to ENA.
• Variable faint cytoplasmic staining may be seen on HEp-2 cells.
• Therefore antibodies to Jo-1 should be included routinely in the
6-antigen ENA screen (see ‘ENA antibodies’, p.491).
• Target antigens are aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases. Jo-1 is the major
antigen but other speciﬁcities have been identiﬁed.
• Jo-1: histidyl-tRNA synthetase.
• PL-7: threonyl-tRNA synthetase (not reactive in immunoblotting,
?conformational epitope).
• PL-12: alanyl-tRNA synthetase.
• OJ: isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase.
• EJ: glycyl-tRNA synthetase.
• lysyl-tRNA synthetase.
• All are associated with myositis. Only Jo-1 is common.
• Antibodies to signal recognition particles (SRPs) may also be
associated, especially in dermatomyositis and polymyositis without the
additional features of the anti-synthetase syndrome.
• Anti-SRP anti-bodies give a granular cytoplasmic staining on HEp-2
cells.
• Jo-1 antibodies are detected by EIA or immunoblotting.
• Other speciﬁcities are detected by immunoprecipitation from cell
lysates followed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.
• EQA for ENA covers Jo-1 but not other antigens.
• An international standard is available for Jo-1.

Ki and Ku antibodies
Ki antibodies
• Ki antibodies recognize a 32kDa protein.
• Ki used to be thought to be identical to Ku but is now known to be
distinct.
• Occur in 10% of SLE and are increased in CNS SLE.
• May be detected by CIE or EIA.

Ku antibodies (also known as PL-2 and SL)
• Ku antibodies recognize 66 and 86kDa DNA-binding proteins (DNAdependent protein kinase involved in dsDNA repair).
• Found in patients with SLE, MCTD, Sjögren’s syndrome, RhA, and
scleroderma (often with myositis).
• Patient likely to have Raynaud’s phenomenon.

LKM AND LM ANTIBODIES

• Also found in primary pulmonary hypertension, polymyositis, Graves’
disease, ITP.
• They are of little diagnostic value.
• IIF shows ﬁne speckled nuclear and nucleolar staining depending on
the stage of the cell cycle.

La (SS-B) antibodies
• Antibodies to the ENA La recognize a 48kDa protein complexed to
small RNAs that is probably involved in processing of RNA Pol III
transcripts.
• Protein has sequence homology with a retroviral protein.
• Antibody to La is found mainly in primary Sjögren’s syndrome.
• It is very rare in Sjögren’s syndrome secondary to rheumatoid arthritis,
systemic sclerosis, or primary biliary cirrhosis.
• About 15% of patients with SLE will have antibodies to La.
• Antibodies to this speciﬁcity have been associated with neonatal
congenital complete heart block. This is less common than with
anti-Ro antibodies.
For methods of detection, see ‘ENA antibodies’, p.491.

Liver cytosol antibodies (LC1)
• LC1 antibodies seen in:
• autoimmune hepatitis type 2 associated with LKM antibodies
• autoimmune cholangitis.
• Antigen is forminimontransferase cyclodeaminase (FTCD).
• Titre may correlate with disease activity.
• Pattern on IIF similar to that of LKM antibodies.
• Conﬁrm with immunoblot against 58kDa protein.

Liver-kidney microsomal (LKM)
and liver microsomal (LM)
antibodies
• Units: titre (semi-quantitative).
• Normal adult range: negative.

Principles of testing
• IIF on tissue multiblock.
• Immunoblotting with puriﬁed antigen to conﬁrm.

Indications
• Suspected autoimmune hepatitis.

505

506

CHAPTER 18

Autoantibodies

Interpretation
• LKM antibodies bind to microsomes in the cytoplasm of hepatocytes
and the cells of the proximal renal tubules, but do not stain distal renal
tubules.
• Often confused with mitochondrial antibodies, but the latter will also
stain both the stomach and other tubules in the kidney.
• Three types of LKM antibodies have been described: LKM-1, LKM-2,
and LKM-3.
• LKM-1 antibodies recognize the cytochrome P450IID6 and are
associated with types 2a and 2b autoimmune chronic active hepatitis:
• type 2a disease begins in childhood in 50% of cases and is associated
with autoimmunity to thyroid and gastric parietal cells
• type 2b is associated with antibodies to hepatitis C in addition to
the LKM antibodies.
• LKM-2 recognize the cytochrome P450IIC8, C9, C10 and are associated
with hepatitis induced by the diuretic ticrynafen (tienilic acid).
• LKM-3 recognize uridine diphosphate glucuronyl tranferase and have
been reported in hepatitis.
• Hepatitis-D infection is also associated with antibodies to the lamins
of the nuclear envelope.
• Liver microsomes (LM antibodies) can be seen, where the target
antigen is cytochrome P450IA2.
• Fluorescence staining is most marked in perivenous hepatocytes.
• Associated with hepatitis induced by the drug dihydralazine.

Loop of Henle antibodies and lupus
anticoagulant
Loop of Henle antibodies
• This pattern is extremely rare and is probably of low diagnostic value.
• Reported cases have had renal tubular acidosis, pernicious anaemia,
and primary biliary cirrhosis.

Lupus anticoagulant
See ‘Cardiolipin antibodies (ACA) and lupus anticoagulant’, p.485.

Lymphocytotoxic antibodies
• Autoantibodies (as opposed to alloantibodies induced by pregnancy or
transfusion) to lymphocytes have been detected in:
• rheumatoid arthritis
• systemic sclerosis
• SLE.
• Their role in the generation of lymphopenia is uncertain.
• There is no evidence to support their role in the lymphopenia of
common variable immunodeﬁciency.
• Routine search for these antibodies is probably of little clinical value.

MITOCHONDRIAL ANTIBODIES (AMA)

Ma antibodies
• Antibodies to Ma2 are found in patients with limbic encephalitis in
association with germ cell tumours of the testis (78%), and occur in
young patients.
• Ma1 and M3 antibodies are found in older patients with cerebellar
syndromes in association with tumours (lung, parotid, breast, colon).
• Antibodies react with neuronal nucleolar proteins.

Mi-2 antibodies
• Antibodies to this ENA are typically found in patients with a steroidresponsive dermatomyositis.
• Antibodies are rare in polymyositis (<1%).
• Antibodies recognize a 240kDa nuclear antigen (helicase).
• Homogeneous nuclear staining on HEp-2 cells is usually seen.

Mitochondrial antibodies (AMA)
• Units: titre (semi-quantitative).
• Normal adult range: titre <1/40.

Principles of testing
• IIF using tissue multiblock.
• Follow-up tests using EIA or immunoblots against puriﬁed antigens
conﬁrm speciﬁcity.

Indications for testing
• Suspected autoimmune liver disease.

Interpretation (see Table 18.1)
• AMA show typical granular staining on the cytoplasm of all cells in the
tissue multiblock.
• May be confused with LKM, ribosomal, and SRP antibodies.
• Nine discrete reactivities have been described, although these are not
all detectable on standard tissue sections.
• For those patterns that are detectable, the distinction is dependent on
recognizing quantitative differences in the level of staining of different
cell populations.
• Few laboratories report the different speciﬁcities by IIF.
• M2 antibodies are strongly associated with primary biliary cirrhosis,
and more than 95% of PBC patients will be positive.
• New mitochondrial antibodies should be put up against the E2 antigen
in an EIA or immunoblot (see mitochondrial M2 antibodies) to conﬁrm
the speciﬁcity.
• M4 and M8 antibodies usually occur with M2 antibodies. This pattern is
associated with severe disease.
• M9 antibodies occurring alone are associated with mild disease.

Autoimmune hepatitis

• Patients with type 3 autoimmune chronic active hepatitis (usually
associated with antibodies to soluble liver antigens) will often have
anti-mitochondrial antibodies and this entity may be an overlap
syndrome of CAH and PBC.
• Mitochondrial antibodies are often detected in patients with
autoimmune thyroiditis, rheumatoid arthritis, scleroderma, and
Sjögren’s syndrome, diseases that are associated clinically with PBC.

MULTIPLE NUCLEAR DOT ANTIBODY

Mitochondrial M2 antibodies
• Units: qualitative.
• Normal adult range: negative.

Principles of testing
• EIA using puriﬁed E2 antigen.
• Immunoblot/line blot assay.

Indications
• Conﬁrmation of speciﬁcity of AMA detected by IIF.

Interpretation
• Antigen of the M2 mitochondrial autoantibodies is now known to be
the E2 component of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex.
• Speciﬁcity for PBC approaches 100%.
• Other components, E1-A and E1-B, as well the E2 subunit of
branched-chain dehydrogenase, are target antigens.
• In view of the association of mitochondrial antibodies with diseases
other than PBC, it is now advisable to screen AMA-positive sera for
antibodies to the M2 antigen to conﬁrm the speciﬁcity.
• Screening for PBC in the ﬁrst instance should be by IIF (non-M2
patterns may be identiﬁed).

MuSK antibodies
• Antibodies to muscle-speciﬁc receptor tyrosine kinase may be found in
acetylcholine receptor antibody negative myasthenia gravis.
• Antibodies to MuSK interfere with signalling by the nerve released
ligand, agrin. MuSK and agrin are required for the formation of the
neuromuscular junction.
• Patients are more likely to be female, to have less eye involvement,
and likely to be African Caribbean.

Multiple nuclear dot antibody
Two patterns of multiple nuclear dots are recognized on HEp-2 cells.
• Nsp-1: pattern of 2-6 dots located close to the nucleolus.
• Antibodies to p80 coilin (anti-coiled body antibodies).
• Seen in primary biliary cirrhosis.
• Nsp-2: pattern of 5-10 dots (up to 30).
• Antibodies to a soluble nuclear protein Sp100.
• Often called pseudo-centromere, but there is no staining of the
metaphase plate as in a true centromere antibody.
• This pattern is associated with a subgroup of patients with primary
biliary cirrhosis, especially those who are anti-M2 antibody negative.

509

510

CHAPTER 18

Autoantibodies

Myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG)
antibodies
• IgM anti-MAG antibodies are associated with paraproteinaemic
polyneuropathies where the paraprotein is IgM (but not IgG or IgA).
• Levels of antibody do not correlate with severity of the nerve disease,
but removing the antibody by plasma exchange or immunosuppression
can improve the neuropathy.
• Rarely, anti-MAG antibodies are found in Guillain-Barré syndrome,
MS, and myasthenia gravis.

Nephritic factors
Nephritic factors are autoantibodies of either IgG or IgM class that stabilize activated complement components and prevent their normal inactivation by the control proteins. Four types are recognized.

C3-nephritic factor
• An autoantibody to the alternate pathway C3 convertase (C3bBb) that
stabilizes the convertase and prevents its natural destruction by factors
H and I.
• Antibody recognizes the Bb component of the convertase, allowing
continuous and unregulated activation of C3.
• Detected by its effect on C3 mobility on electrophoresis, using
immunoﬁxation, and is reported as present or absent.
• Patients with mesangiocapillary glomerulonephritis type II and/or
partial lipodystrophy who have a markedly reduced C3 should be
screened for the presence of a C3-nephritic factor.
• Not all patients with partial lipodystrophy who have a C3-nephritic
factor will have renal disease, although there is an increased risk of
their developing it.
• Not all patients with C3-nephritic factor have partial lipodystrophy.

C4-nephritic factor
• A rare autoantibody that stabilizes the active form of C4 (C4bC2a) and
leads to increased activation of the ﬁrst part of the classical pathway.
• Because the normal regulatory processes are intact at the level of C3,
the reaction proceeds no further.
• C4 and C3 are usually reduced.
• Associated with SLE and other types of glomerulonephritis.
• Detected by electrophoretic studies of activated serum using
immunoﬁxation.

Properdin-dependent nephritic factor
• A nephritic factor of the alternate pathway that slowly cleaves C3, C5,
and C9 and depends on the presence of properdin.
• It is heat labile.
• It occurs in other types of mesangiocapillary glomerulonephritis.

NEUTROPHIL ANTIBODIES

C1q antibodies
• These antibodies occur in SLE and mesangiocapillary GN.
• They recognize activated C1q (bound to antibody or solid phase).

Neuronal antibodies and neuronal
nuclear antibodies (ANNA)
Neuronal antibodies
• These antibodies react with a 96kDa surface antigen of neuronal cells
and occur mainly in patients with neuropsychiatric lupus.
• May be detected by immunoﬂuorescence on cultured human
neuroblastoma cell lines or by Western blotting.
• May be found in serum of patients with SLE (11%) even in the absence
of neuropsychiatric lupus.
• Approximately 74% of patients with neuropsychiatric lupus will have
these antibodies.
• It has been suggested that the titre of antibodies correlates with
degree of neuropsychiatric impairment.
• More speciﬁc for neuropsychiatric lupus than ribosomal P antibodies.
• Anti-Yo antibodies recognize the cytoplasm of Purkinje cells (see ‘Yo
antibodies’, p.532).

Neuronal nuclear antibodies (ANNA)
• ANNA-1 (anti-Hu) react with all neuronal cell nuclei (see ‘Hu
antibodies’, p.501).
• ANNA-2 (anti-Ri) react only with central not peripheral neuronal cell
nuclei (see ‘Ri antibodies’, p.523).
• ANNA-3 very rare recognizing 170kDa protein in terminally
differentiated neurons and podocytes.
• Anti-Ma1, Ma2 (Ta), Ma3 expressed on neuronal nucleoli (see ‘Ma
antibodies’, p.507).
• Anti-Zic4 (see ‘Zic4 antibodies’, p.532).

Neutrophil antibodies
• Antibodies against neutrophil surface antigens may occur in
autoimmune neutropenia.
• Because of the presence of Fc receptors for IgG on neutrophils, it is
very difﬁcult to prove unequivocally that anti-neutrophil antibodies are
present, and none of the current techniques is entirely satisfactory.
• Tests used include:
• neutrophil agglutination
• antibody-mediated phagocytosis of neutrophils by macrophages
• antibody-dependent lysis
• ﬂow cytometry.

511

512

CHAPTER 18

Autoantibodies

• Antibodies speciﬁc for neutrophil nuclei, reacting with unknown
antigens, are found in RhA with vasculitis, particularly in Felty’s
syndrome (RhA, splenomegaly, vasculitis and leg ulceration,
neutropenia).
• Homogeneous nuclear staining is present only on neutrophils, and
not on liver or HEp-2 cells.
• Their importance is more in their potential to cause
misinterpretation in tests for ANCA, where they may be confused
with the perinuclear pattern by the inexperienced.

Neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies
(ANCA)
• Units: titre.
• Normal adult range: titre < 1/10.

Principles of testing
• ANCA are detected on ethanol-ﬁxed human granulocytes.
• Other ﬁxation methods are not recommended by the International
Consensus Statement.
• P-ANCA pattern results from a redistribution of certain cytoplasmic
antigens when cold ethanol is used as a ﬁxative for the human
neutrophils.
• Positive results should be followed up with antigen-speciﬁc EIA or
immunoblots.
• Serial monitoring of titre may be valuable.

Indications for testing
• Rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis pulmonary haemorrhage.
• New patients must always have both ANCA and GBM performed.

Interpretation (see Table 18.2)
• 90% of patients with Wegener’s granulomatosis will be C-ANCA+.
• 5-10% of WG patients will be ANCA-.
• Antibodies are present in both the systemic and localized forms of
WG.
• As a test for WG, meta-analysis of all published data has shown a
sensitivity of 66% and a speciﬁcity of 98%.
• 30% of patients with microscopic polyarteritis and Churg-Strauss
syndrome will be C-ANCA+.
• C-ANCA antigen is proteinase 3 (Pr3), a granule protein also
expressed on the neutrophil surface.
• Perinuclear (P-ANCA) pattern is found less commonly in WG
and MPA, but mainly in other forms of severe vasculitis, including
Churg-Strauss syndrome, SLE, and rheumatoid vasculitis.
• Atypical ANCA (X-ANCA) may occur in inﬂammatory bowel disease,
particularly where there is liver involvement (primary sclerosing
cholangitis (PSC)).

• Where there is doubt check ﬂuorescent pattern on tissue
multiblock to exclude ANA.
• Serial monitoring of C-ANCA is useful as a rising titre may herald a
relapse of WG.
• Patients with treated vasculitis may remain weakly ANCA+ for years in
clinical remission.
• Whether there is any value in serial monitoring of P-ANCA is less
certain.
• IgA ANCA have been reported in Henoch-Schönlein purpura.

NMDA (N-methyl-d-aspartate) receptor
antibodies
• Antibodies to NR1 and NR2 have been associated with a limbic
encephalitis, SLE, and variant epilepsies.
• There is an association with ovarian or mediastinal teratomas
expressing the NMDA receptor, although cases may occur without any
evidence of malignancy.

514

CHAPTER 18

Autoantibodies

Nuclear antibodies (ANA)
• Units: semi-quantitative.
• Normal ranges:
• age <18, titre <1/20
• age 18-65, titre <1/40
• age >65, titre <1/8.

Principles of testing
• Testing is undertaken by IIF using a tissue multiblock with HEp-2 cells.
• Genetically modiﬁed HEp-2 cells (HEp-2000) are said to express higher
levels of Ro antigen. In practice, there is little advantage when the
microscopist is experienced.
• Ro antigens may be eluted from rodent liver and give false-negative
results (‘ANA-negative lupus’). These will be identiﬁed by parallel use
of HEp-2 cells.
• HEp-2 cells are more sensitive. Screening with HEp-2 cells will increase
the false-positive rate compared with rodent liver.
• HEp-2 cells are valuable for identiﬁcation of staining pattern.
• EIA screening assays are available to reduce the number of negative
immunoﬂuorescent screens performed.
• Only IgG antibodies are of clinical signiﬁcance. Screening should be
carried out with anti-human IgG-FITC, not polyvalent antibodies.
• Initial screening dilution for serum must be modiﬁed for children.
• Appropriate titratable controls are required.
• Reporting should include signiﬁcant patterns.
• EQA is available: performance is variable.
• Modern ﬂuorescent microscopes signiﬁcantly affect titration results.
• International standards are available.

Indications for testing
• Suspected connective tissue disease.

Interpretation (see Table 18.3)
• Nuclear antibodies are associated with the connective tissue diseases.
• Only IgG antibodies are signiﬁcant.
• IgM ANA are non-speciﬁc and frequently occur after viral infections.
• Occasional patients with connective tissue disease produce only
IgM ANA.
• IgM ANA occur in rheumatoid arthritis (cross-reactive IgM RhF).
• Signiﬁcance of the titre of IgG ANA is age-dependent.
• Low-titre positive ANAs in the elderly must be carefully interpreted in
the context of relevant clinical symptoms and signs.
• Pattern of ANA identiﬁes likely antigens and signiﬁcance.
• Follow-up testing with ENA and dsDNA assays is required to fully
investigate antigenic speciﬁcities identiﬁed by IIF.
• Because of the long circulating half-life of the autoantibodies,
measurement does not need to be carried out more frequently than
once every 3 weeks (unless the patient has been plasmapheresed).
• Detection of a strong positive ANA is an indicator for conﬁrmatory tests,
including dsDNA, ENA, and, if clinically appropriate, histone antibodies.

Nuclear matrix antibodies
• These antibodies give large coarse speckles on HEp-2 cells.
• Speciﬁcity appears to be against heterogeneous nuclear RNA and
matrix proteins. At least four proteins, of molecular weight 70, 31, 23,
and 19kDa, are recognized by immunoblotting.
• 70kDa determinant is U1-RNP.
• These antibodies are rarely seen but occur in lupus as well as in
undifferentiated connective tissue diseases.

Nuclear mitotic spindle antibodies (MSA)
Antibodies will only be seen on HEp-2 cells. They are rare and not speciﬁc,
being found in:
• SLE
• rheumatoid arthritis
• CREST
• MCTD
• Sjögren’s syndrome.

Described patterns
• NuMA (nuclear mitotic apparatus protein, MSA-1) show ﬂuorescence
concentrated at the spindle poles:
• non-speciﬁc (CTDs).
• Anti-tubulin antibodies stain the spindle ﬁbres:
• post-infective and autoimmune disease
• low titres in normal individuals.

OVARIAN ANTIBODIES

Antibodies to MSA show two patterns of staining:
• MSA-2 does not stain interphase cells and is sometimes referred to as
the mid-body pattern:
• associated with systemic sclerosis and Raynaud’s.
• MSA-3 shows ﬁne dense nuclear staining in some interphase cells and
two sets of discrete granules on either side of the metaphase plate in
dividing cells:
• antigen is CENP-F (p330 protein)
• seen rarely in respiratory tract tumours.

Nuclear pore antibodies
• Antibodies to a 210kDa nuclear pore antigen have been described
in up to 27% of cases of primary biliary cirrhosis (in addition to the
multiple nuclear dot pattern).
• IIF on HEp-2 cells gives a punctate perinuclear staining pattern.

Nucleolar antibodies
Nucleolar antibodies will be detected on routine screening on rodent
liver. They are much easier to see on HEp-2 cells, where three discrete
staining patterns can be identiﬁed.
• Speckled nucleolar staining with ﬁne speckled nuclear staining:
• antibody recognizes RNA polymerase I
• present in 4% of patients with systemic sclerosis (diffuse disease).
• Homogeneous nucleolar staining:
• antibody recognizes PM-Scl and also Ku (see ‘PM-Scl antibodies’,
p.519 and ‘Ki and Ku antibodies’, p.504).
• Clumpy nucleolar staining with nuclear dots:
• antibody recognizes ﬁbrillarin, component of U3-RNP
• present in 8% of patients with systemic sclerosis, particularly with
cardiopulmonary involvement.
• Other nucleolar antigens to which autoantibodies have been detected
include:
• Nor-90, a 90kDa protein of the nucleolar organizer region
(nucleolar dot staining on HEp-2 cells)
• To, a 40kDa protein complexed to 7S or 8S RNA associated with
pulmonary hypertension and bowel involvement in scleroderma
• an RNP particle that includes RNA polymerase III.

Ovarian antibodies
• Antibodies identiﬁed by IIF on multiblock (adrenal, ovary, testis,
pituitary).
• Useful for identifying primary autoimmune ovarian failure as a cause of
infertility.
• Found in 15-50% of patients with premature ovarian failure.

517

518

CHAPTER 18

Autoantibodies

• Patients may also be positive for adrenal antibodies (cross-reactive
steroid cell antibodies) and thyroid antibodies.
• Ovarian antibodies recognize P450scc enzyme.
• Antibodies to 3B-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase may be a more
sensitive marker of premature (autoimmune) ovarian failure.
See also ‘Adrenal cortex autoantibodies’, p.483.

Parathyroid antibodies
• Found in patients with:
• idiopathic hypoparathyroidism
• hypoparathyoidism associated with other endocrinopathies
• chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis.
• Detected on group O human parathyroid by immunoﬂuorescence.
• They are impossible to detect if ANA or mitochondrial antibodies
are present.
• Therefore testing should be carried out in parallel with testing on
the standard tissue multiblock.
• Control sera are extremely difﬁcult to obtain.

PCNA (proliferating cell nuclear
antigen) antibodies
• Antigen recognized by the autoantibody is expressed only at certain
times in the cell cycle.
• It is readily detectable only on HEp-2 cells, where it gives variablesized speckles in only some cells.
• Antigen is a 33kDa auxiliary protein for DNA polymerase-D.
• PCNA has erroneously been referred to as cyclin.
• It is seen in about 3% of patients with SLE, but does not appear to
identify any particular clinical subgroup.

Pituitary gland antibodies
• Antibodies to pituitary components have been described in:
• a variety of centrally mediated endocrine disorders, including
autoimmune lymphocytic hypophysitis (70% positive) and
autoimmune hypopituitarism (30% positive)
• empty sella syndrome
• some pituitary tumours
• some patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.
• Antibodies are usually detected by immunoﬂuorescence on pituitary
sections or pituitary cell lines.
• Antibodies recognize a cytoplasmic 49kDa antigen.
• Diagnostic value is uncertain.
• No commercial control sera are available.

POLY-(ADP-RIBOSE) POLYMERASE ANTIBODIES

Platelet antibodies
• Platelet autoantibodies (as opposed to alloantibodies) are found in
patients with ITP.
• Also found in other conditions associated with thrombocytopenia,
such as:
• HIV
• connective tissue diseases
• thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP)
• heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.
• Many techniques have been described to detect such antibodies
including:
• phagocytosis by neutrophils
• lymphocyte activation
• RIA
• EIA
• ﬂow cytometry.
• When sensitive techniques areed, >90% of patients with ITP will be
shown to have platelet-associated IgG.
• There is no consensus on the best technique or on the value of
routine testing.
• Target antigens are varied but include platelet GP Ib, IIb, and IIIa.
• Alloantibodies to platelets react with PLA1 antigen.

PM-Scl antibodies (also known as PM-1)
• PM-Scl antibodies are found in the polymyositis-scleroderma overlap
syndrome.
• May also be found in patients with dermatomyositis/polymyositis or
systemic sclerosis occurring alone.
• There may be an increased risk of renal disease in the overlap patients.
• Target antigen appears to be a complex of 11 proteins occurring in the
nucleolus and elsewhere:
• two major antigens are PM/Scl-100 and PM/Scl-75.
• The pattern of immunoﬂuorescence on HEp-2 cells is variable, with
homogeneous nucleolar staining with some atypical nuclear speckling
and cytoplasmic staining.
• Detection is usually by immunodiffusion or immunoblotting.

Poly-(ADP-ribose) polymerase
antibodies
• These antibodies to the 116kDa protein have been reported in
Sjögren’s syndrome and in association with neuropathy.
• They are not sought routinely.

519

520

CHAPTER 18

Autoantibodies

Purkinje cell antibodies
See ‘Yo antibodies’, p.532.

RA-33 antibodies and rheumatoidassociated nuclear antibodies (RANA)
RA-33 antibodies
• These antibodies have been described as speciﬁc for rheumatoid
arthritis.
• They react with a 33kDa non-histone nuclear antigen of HeLa cells.
• There are insufﬁcient data to evaluate their utility.

Rheumatoid-associated nuclear antibodies (RANA)
• If EBV-transformed cell lines are used as a target, antibodies that react
only with EBV-infected nuclei but not normal nuclei can be detected in
serum of patients with RhA and other connective tissue diseases.
• There is no routine value to this test.

Recoverin antibodies
• See retinal S100 antibodies.

Renal biopsy (direct
immunoﬂuorescence)
• Direct immunoﬂuorescence of renal biopsies is an essential part of the
evaluation of renal disease.
• DIF should always take place in parallel with examination of biopsies
with standard stains and by electron microscopy.
• Staining should include the use of antisera to IgG, IgA, IgM, C3, C4, and
ﬁbrinogen.
• Linear deposition of IgG in the glomeruli is a feature of anti-GBM
disease.
• IgA deposition is heavy in a segmental pattern in IgA nephropathy.
• Henoch-Schönlein purpura is also associated with IgA deposition,
often with ﬁbrin deposition.
• In type II MPGN associated with a nephritic factor, there is heavy C3
deposition in the GBM, without immunoglobulin.
• Patchy IgG and C3, or C3 alone, is seen in post-streptococcal GN.
• SLE may give any pattern of renal disease, and is usually accompanied
by IgG, IgM, and complement deposition with a variable distribution.
• In tubulo-interstitial nephritis, there may be antibodies to the tubular
basement membrane.

RETINAL S100 AND CAR ANTIBODIES

Reticulin antibodies
• These antibodies are non-speciﬁc.
• They are found in:
• coeliac disease
• inﬂammatory bowel disease, particularly where there is
concomitant liver disease.
• They may occur in the absence of clinical disease in the elderly.
• They will be detected as part of the ‘autoimmune screen’ on a tissue
multiblock.
• If coeliac disease is suspected, endomysial or tTG antibodies should be
requested.
• IgA reticulin antibodies are slightly more speciﬁc for coeliac disease
than IgG antibodies, but sensitivity and speciﬁcity is far lower than for
EMA and tTG antibodies.
• Up to ﬁve different patterns of anti-reticulin antibodies have been
described using immunoﬂuorescence.
• Only the R1 pattern is associated with coeliac disease.
• IgA-R1-reticulin antibodies are reported to have a speciﬁcity of 98%
but a sensitivity of only 25% for coeliac disease.
• Laboratories no longer report reticulin antibodies routinely.
• Detection of strong R1 ARA should trigger EMA or tTG testing
automatically in the laboratory.
See ‘Endomysial antibodies (EMA)’, p.492 and ‘Tissue transglutaminase
(tTG) antibodies’, p.530.

Retinal S100 and cancer-associated
retinopathy (CAR) antibodies
• Antibodies against retinal antigens (S100) have been identiﬁed in many
types of chronic inﬂammatory eye disease affecting the uveal tract,
including Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome.
• Antibodies are not disease-speciﬁc.
• Diagnostic value is uncertain at present.
• The antibodies may induce demyelination of the optic nerve.
• Other anti-retinal antibodies (CAR) have been described as a
paraneoplastic phenomenon in patients with a cancer-associated
retinopathy syndrome, seen rarely in association with SCLC.
• Antibodies bind to small cell carcinoma cell nuclei.
• Major antigen is recoverin, a calcium-binding protein.
• a-enolase is a minor autoantigen.
• CV2/CRMP5 antibodies may also be associated with CAR.
• Lens-induced uveitis, a rare condition that may follow trauma or
surgery, is associated with circulating antibodies to lens proteins.
• Melanoma-associated retinopathy antigen is not well characterized.

CHAPTER 18

Autoantibodies

Rheumatoid factor (RhF)
• Units:
• titre
• IU/mL.
• Normal adult range:
• titre, <1/80
• <30 IU/mL.

Principles of testing
• Assays detect anti-immunoglobulin antibodies.
• Originally identiﬁed by sheep-cell agglutination test (SCAT, Rose-
Waaler test)—this test is no longer used.
• Now detected by latex or particle agglutination assays, EIA,
nephelometry, or turbidimetry.
• Measurement in IU/mL is preferred, but latex agglutination assays,
which are sensitive but not speciﬁc, provide a cheap screening tool.
• Semi-quantitative particle agglutination assays are less desirable:
• these assays may be susceptible to interference by serum
ﬁbronectin.
• EQA and international standards exist.

Indications for testing
• The only indication for testing is in patients with clinical RhA.
• It is not a screening test for RhA.
• There is no value in the elderly, as RhF may be found in healthy elderly.

Interpretation
• RhF is a non-speciﬁc test as it detects immunoglobulins of any class
reactive with the Fc region of other immunoglobulins.
• RhFs occur in a wide variety of conditions, such as:
• viral infections
• chronic bacterial infections (SBE, TB)
• myeloma
• lymphomas
• many connective tissue diseases
• old age (not associated with disease).
• In myeloma, paraproteins with RhF activity may cause a type II
cryoglobulin.
• In infections and connective tissue diseases, polyclonal RhFs may cause
a type III cryoglobulin.
• RhA patients may be positive or negative for RhFs.
• Those with progressive disease, and with vasculitis, usually have hightitre RhFs.
• There is little value in serial monitoring of RhF as the titre correlates
poorly with disease activity. The CRP is more useful.
• Requesting RhFs in the elderly is not helpful, as positive results do not
necessarily indicate disease.
• At present there is no conclusive evidence that detecting IgA RhFs is
valuable.

RNP ANTIBODIES

Ri antibodies
• Anti-Ri, a rare anti-neuronal nuclear antibody, has been documented
in a few women with breast cancer or SCLC, associated with ataxia,
myoclonus, and opsoclonus.
• Antibodies recognize 55kDa and 80kDa proteins (Nova-1, Nova-2),
found in all neuronal cell nuclei.
• Antibodies can be detected by immunoﬂuorescence and
immunoblotting.

Ribosomal (ribosomal P) antibodies
• Antibodies to ribosomes, particularly to ribosomal ribonucleoprotein
(rRNP), are associated particularly with SLE (about 5-12% of patients).
• Majority of patients with neuropsychiatric lupus will be positive for
ribosomal P antibodies. Antibody level is reported to correlate with
disease activity.
• May also be found in RhA.
• Antibodies recognize three phosphoproteins (P0, P1, P2):
• antigens are distinct from antibodies to nuclear RNPs.
• Ribosomal and ribosomal P antibodies are the same.
• They frequently cause diagnostic confusion as they may be
misinterpreted as mitochondrial antibodies by inexperienced
microscopists.
• They react particularly strongly with the chief cells of rodent
stomach, and also with pancreatic tissue.
• On HEp-2 cells there is ﬁne speckled staining of the cytoplasm and
some staining of nucleoli.
• If seen on autoantibody screen, antibody should be titrated and
reported.

RNP antibodies
• These antibodies recognize nuclear, rather than ribosomal, RNPs.
• There are a number of such complexes (U1-U6-RNPs), which
comprise a number of proteins with small nuclear RNAs.
• The same protein components may occur in more than one RNP
complex.
• The most important antibodies are those against the U1-RNP, which
recognize the 70kDa A and C protein components.
• They give rise to a coarse speckled pattern on IIF on HEp-2 cells.
• Found in SLE and mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD).
• When they occur in the absence of antibodies to dsDNA and Smith
antibodies (Sm). This is supposed to indicate MCTD, although some
authorities doubt that MCTD is truly a distinct entity and prefer to
think of it as a subset of SLE.
• There is no relation between anti-RNP antibody titres and disease
activity.

523

524

CHAPTER 18

Autoantibodies

• Some sera from patients with SLE contain antibodies that react with
both Sm and U1-RNP.
• Antibodies that react with both U1- and U2-RNP, recognizing the
U1-A and U2-B′ proteins, have been described.
• These are seen in SLE and SLE overlap syndromes, particularly
where myositis is a feature.
• Distinction of the ﬁne speciﬁcities of antibodies to nuclear RNPs is not
available routinely, but can be achieved with Western blotting.
• Normally, antibodies to RNP will be detected by immunodiffusion,
countercurrent immunoelectrophoresis, ELISA, or immunoblotting.
See ‘ENA antibodies’, p.491 and ‘Nuclear antibodies (ANA)’, p.514.

Ro (SS-A) antibodies
• Antibodies to the ENA antigen Ro recognize two proteins of 60 and
52kDa complexed with Y1-Y5 RNAs.
• Antibodies have been described that recognize either protein.
• Antibodies are associated with:
• Sjögren’s syndrome, with the highest levels in primary disease
• SLE
• cutaneous LE
• C2-deﬁcient lupus.
• Antibodies are of particular signiﬁcance in pregnancy, as they are
usually of IgG class and cross the placenta.
• Ro antigen is expressed transiently in the fetal cardiac conducting
system.
• Maternal anti-Ro binds to the antigen and causes ﬁbrosis, leading to
congenital complete heartblock.
• Antibodies are also responsible for neonatal lupus.
• Antigen is also inducible in keratinocytes by UV light, explaining strong
association of anti-Ro with photosensitivity and with cutaneous disease.
• Anti-Ro is the speciﬁcity detected in so-called ‘ANA-negative lupus’.
• Ro antigens are easily eluted from rodent tissue, causing falsenegative results.
• HEp-2 (and HEp-2000) cells have higher levels of Ro antigen and
are not susceptible to this problem.
• Antibodies show a ﬁne nuclear speckled staining on HEp-2 cells.
• Commercial assays for Ro52 and Ro65 are available.
See ‘ENA antibodies’, p.491 and ‘Nuclear antibodies (ANA)’, p.514.

Salivary gland antibodies
• It is not possible to test for these in the presence of anti-nuclear or
anti-mitochondrial antibodies.
• They are associated with Sjögren’s syndrome and are more likely to
occur in secondary than primary disease.
• Detected by IIF on rodent salivary gland.

SM (SMITH) ANTIBODIES

Scl-70 antibodies
• Found in 20-40% of patients with progressive systemic sclerosis (PSS).
• Found in 20% of patients with limited scleroderma.
• Associated particularly with severe skin disease, musculoskeletal
disease, and cardiopulmonary disease.
• Antibody may be a marker for the development of carcinoma of the
lung in PSS.
• Do not predict the development of renal disease, although their
presence in patients with isolated Raynaud’s predicts the subsequent
development of PSS and hence is a poor prognostic marker.
• Antigen recognized is topoisomerase I, an enzyme involved in
supercoiling DNA:
• autoantibody interferes with the function of the target antigen.
• Scl-70 and anti-centromere antibodies appear to be mutually exclusive,
as only two cases have ever been reported of coexistence of both
speciﬁcities.
• Scl-70 antibodies give an atypical granular nuclear speckled pattern on
HEp-2 cells.
• Deﬁnitive proof of their presence is obtained by mmunodiffusion,
ELISA, or immunoblotting.
See ‘ENA antibodies’, p.491 and ‘Nuclear antibodies (ANA)’, p.514.

Signal recognition particle (SRP)
antibodies
• These antibodies produce a cytoplasmic staining pattern on HEp-2
cells that may be mistaken for that of mitochondrial antibodies.
• The antigen is a 54kDa protein complexed with RNA.
• It is associated with polymyositis and dermatomyositis.

Skin and mucosal biopsies (direct
immunoﬂuorescence)
See ‘Epidermal antibodies (including direct immunoﬂuorescence of skin)’,
p.494.

Sm (Smith) antibodies
• These antibodies, named after the patient in whom they were ﬁrst
described, are speciﬁc for SLE.
• They are seen most frequently in West Indians with SLE.
• Rare in Caucasians.
• Antibodies react with the B′/B and D proteins shared by U1-, U2-, and
U4-U6-RNPs.

525

526

CHAPTER 18

Autoantibodies

• These speciﬁcities are often seen with antibodies to U1-RNP.
• Whether occurring alone or with anti-RNP, these antibodies are
accepted as a diagnostic criterion for lupus.
• They are usually detected by the same techniques as used for other
ENAs.
See ‘ENA antibodies’, p.491.

Smooth muscle antibodies (SMA)
• Units: titre (semi-quantitative).
• Normal adult range: titre, <1/40.

Principles of testing
• IIF on tissue multiblock.
• Speciﬁc subpatterns may be identiﬁed on HEp-2 cells.

Indications for testing
• Suspected autoimmune hepatitis.

Interpretation
• SMA typically stain the muscular coats of arteries and the muscular
layer of the stomach section, where there is also staining of the
intergastric gland ﬁbres. On HEp-2 cells, a meshwork of ﬁne
cytoplasmic ﬁbres may be seen.
• SMA are present in high titre in 50-70% of patients with autoimmune
‘lupoid’ hepatitis (type 1):
• 25% of patients may also be positive for nuclear and dsDNA
antibodies.
• Also seen in association with hepatitis B surface antigenaemia and
adenovirus infection.
• High-titre SMA antibodies against F-actin are seen in type 4 hepatitis,
which affects predominantly young children.
• Antibodies to F-actin also seen in a subset of PBC patients.
• Other SMA directed against tropomyosin may be found.

Soluble liver antigen (SLA) antibodies
and Sp100 antibodies
Soluble liver antigen (SLA) antibodies
• Predominant marker for type 3 hepatitis.
• May be the only autoantibody in up to 25% of cases.
• Target antigen for SLA antibodies is thought to be a unique enzyme
that is a member of the pyridoxal phosphate-dependent transferases.
• SLA is the same as liver/pancreas antibodies
• Testing is by immunoblot.

STRIATED MUSCLE ANTIBODIES

Sp100 antibodies
• Antibodies to this antigen of nucleus give rise to the multiple nuclear
dot (6-10 dots) pattern of staining on HEp-2 cells (Nsp-2, pseudocentromere).
• It is found in AMA-negative primary biliary cirrhosis.
• A commercial ELISA assay for antibodies to this antigen is available.
See ‘Nuclear antibodies (ANA)’, p.514.

Sperm antibodies
Sperm antibodies
• Both agglutinating and immobilizing antibodies have been described.
• Direct agglutination, indirect agglutination, and EIA are used to
detect antibodies.
• An international standard exists and there is an EQA scheme in the
UK.
• Multiple antigens seem to be involved and only some seem to be
important in interfering with fertility.
• They are common after vasectomy (50% of men).
• May occur after trauma to the testes.
• Detected in:
• 1-12% of women
• 10-20% of women with infertility.
• Antibodies may be of IgG or IgA class and may be found in serum or
seminal/cervical secretions.

Steroid cell antibodies
See ‘Adrenal cortex autoantibodies’, p.483 and ‘Ovarian antibodies’,
p.517.

Striated muscle antibodies
Striated muscle antibodies
• Present in 25-40% of patients with myasthenia gravis.
• Almost all (80-100%) patients with myasthenia with thymoma are
positive.
• A subgroup of myasthenic patients <40 years of age may be positive in
the absence of thymoma.
• May be seen in patients on penicillamine.
• May be seen in graft-versus-host disease after BMT.
• Constitute an important simple screening test in myasthenia for the
presence of thymoma and should form part of the diagnostic work-up.

527

528

CHAPTER 18

Autoantibodies

• Antigen is thought to be a protein of the I-band of the myocyte (titin).
• Detected by IIF on primate striated muscle.
• Rodent striated muscle may give false-positive results.

Sympathetic nervous system
antibodies
• Antibodies reactive with sympathetic ganglia and adrenal medulla may
be seen in type I IDDM.
• Not routinely available.

Thyroid microsomal (peroxidase)
antibodies
• Units:
• semiquantitative (particle agglutination)
• KU/L (EIA).
• Normal adult range:
• titre, <1/800 (particle agglutination)
• 0-60 kU/L (EIA may vary between assays).

Principles of testing
• Particle agglutination assays (thyroid microsomal antibodies) give semiquantitative results:
• particle agglutination assays use either tanned red cells or latex
particles.
• EIA for thyroid peroxidase antibodies is preferred assay and gives
quantitative results.
• Immunoﬂuorescence using thyroid tissue in a multiblock can no longer
be recommended.
• Ideally, TPO antibodies should be integrated into thyroid testing
strategy, linked to TSH results, on main biochemistry analysers.
• An international standard exists and there is an EQA scheme in
the UK.

Indications for testing
• Suspected thyroid disease.
• Autoimmune polyglandular syndromes.

Interpretation
• Present in high titre in:
• 95% of patients with Hashimoto’s thyroiditis
• 18% of patients with Graves’ disease
• 90% of patients with primary myxoedema.
• Present in low titres in patients with:
• colloidal goitre
• thyroid carcinoma

THYROID-BINDING (STIMULATING/BLOCKING) ANTIBODIES

•
•
•
•

• transiently in de Quervain’s thyroiditis
• occasionally in normal people.
Positive TPO antibodies have also been associated with increased
risks of pre-eclampsia, post-natal depression, and peri-menopausal
depression.
They may also be found in patients with other organ-speciﬁc
autoimmune diseases such as pernicious anaemia, Addison’s
disease, etc.
Antigen is now known to be thyroid peroxidase.
There is no diagnostic value in simultaneous testing of thyroglobulin
and thyroid microsomal/TPO antibodies.

Thyroglobulin antibodies
• Normal adult range: titre <1/400 by particle agglutination.
• Occurrence is similar to that of thyroid microsomal (peroxidase)
antibodies but thyroglobulin antibodies are less sensitive and speciﬁc.
• Little additional information over and above testing for thyroid
microsomal/TPO antibodies.
• Main use is to detect interfering assays in thyroglobulin assays (used to
monitor thyroid cancer).
• EQA scheme in UK has been wound up, but an international standard
exists.

Thyroid-binding (stimulating/blocking)
antibodies
• Three classes of functional antibodies have also been described:
• thyroid-stimulating antibodies that increase cAMP levels in
thyrocytes
• thyroid growth-promoting antibodies that increase tritiated
thymidine uptake into DNA by isolated thyrocytes
• thyroid-blocking antibodies that block the binding of TSH to its
receptor on thyrocytes.
• Several sites of antibody binding to the TSH-R have been
demonstrated.
• All three types of antibody have been strongly associated with Graves’
disease and rarely occur in other types of thyroid disease.
• They may be of clinical signiﬁcance through correlation with response
to therapy and outcome.
• Their detection involves bioassay with in vitro culture of thyrocytes, or
competitive RIA.
• Commercial RIA for thyrotropin receptor antibody (TRAB) does
not distinguish the different types of antibodies.
• An international standard exists.

529

530

CHAPTER 18

Autoantibodies

Thyroid orbital antibodies
• These are found in Graves’ disease.
• They bind to the retro-orbital fat or ﬁbroblasts, causing hypertrophy
and resulting in exophthalmos.
• The antigen(s) is unknown.
• Antibodies may persist even when the thyroid disease is treated
(exophthalmos may progress).
• There is no routine screen for these antibodies.

Tissue transglutaminase (tTG)
antibodies
• tTG is the major autoantigen responsible for anti-endomysial antibody
staining pattern by IIF on monkey oesophagus.
• EIA assays for tTG have high sensitivity and speciﬁcity for coeliac disease.
• Human recombinant antigen-based assays have superior performance
to guinea-pig-derived tTG assays.
• EIA assays have the advantage of automation and rapid throughput.
• The test is too sensitive for routine screening in primary care, but is
excellent for monitoring compliance with a gluten-free diet.
• EIA assays will give quantitative results in arbitrary values.
See ‘Endomysial antibodies (EMA)’, p.492.

Tr antibodies
• Anti-Tr antibodies are found in paraneoplastic cerebellar ataxia
associated with Hodgkin’s lymphoma.
• Antibodies can be found in both serum and CSF.
• Staining pattern is similar to anti-Yo antibodies on Purkinje cell
cytoplasm.

Tubulin and ubiquitin antibodies
Tubulin antibodies
• IgM antibodies to tubulin are associated with:
• EBV infection
• visceral leishmaniasis
• liver disease (PBC, AIH, HBV infection).
• Identiﬁed on HEp-2 cells.

Ubiquitin antibodies
• These antibodies occur in up to 80% of cases of SLE and are said to be
speciﬁc.
• At present, they are not measured routinely.

VOLTAGE-GATED POTASSIUM-CHANNEL (VGKC) ANTIBODIES

Vimentin antibodies
• Non-speciﬁc pattern, associated with:
• PBC, AIH
• infection
• SLE
• Behçet’s syndrome
• angioimmunoblastic lymphadenopathy
• Crohn’s disease.
• Detected by screening on HEp-2 cells.

Voltage-gated calcium-channel (VGCC)
antibodies
• IgG antibodies against the presynaptic calcium channel (P/Q-type) on
the nerve terminal cause the Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome
(LEMS).
• The number of channels is reduced because of cross-linking and
internalization, and this impairs release of acetylcholine. Complement
is also involved.
• LEMS is usually associated with SCLC.
• 90% of SCLC-associated LEMS will be positive for antibodies to
VGCC.
• 40% of patients with LEMS have no detectable tumour at
presentation, but it may become obvious subsequently.
• LEMS may also occur in patients who do not have SCLC.
• Several types of calcium channel exist, and the antibody is speciﬁc for
the neuronal (N) type.
• Similar antibodies have also been documented in amyotrophic lateral
sclerosis, although the signiﬁcance is uncertain (anti-ganglioside
antibodies may also occur in these patients).
• Antibodies are detected by RIA using precipitation of VGCC with
labelled ω-conotoxin.

Voltage-gated potassium-channel
(VGKC) antibodies
• Antibody has been associated with acquired neuromyotonia.
• Detected by RIA using precipitation of I125-A-dendrotoxin labelled
VGKCs.
• Reported in pM-bound toxin:
• >200, pM positive
• <100, pM negative.
• Potassium channels are located on the nerve terminal and control
nerve excitability.

531

532

CHAPTER 18

Autoantibodies

Yo antibodies
• Yo antibodies have been associated with paraneoplastic cerebellar
degeneration, seen typically with ovarian cancer and, less commonly,
with breast cancer or Hodgkin’s lymphoma.
• Development of cerebellar syndrome may precede the diagnosis of
ovarian tumour.
• Do not occur in the cerebellar syndrome seen in SCLC.
• Antigen is found in the cytoplasm of Purkinje cells, and gives a coarse
granular staining by immunoﬂuorescence.
• The putative target antigen (CDR34) is expressed on epithelial
tumours as well as neuronal tissue (cross-reactive anti-tumour
antibody).
• Antibodies are detectable in the CSF as well as serum and disappear
with successful treatment of the primary tumour.

Zic4 antibodies
• IgG antibodies to Zic4 are found in association with SCLC in both
cerebrospilnal ﬂuid and serum.
• Binds to neuronal nuclei on immunoﬂuorescence.
• May occur with anti-Hu, which makes detection difﬁcult.

CHAPTER 19

Allergy tests

Introduction
The techniques used for allergy diagnosis in vitro are those already discussed in Chapters 17 and 18, and include RIA and EIA. Flow cytometry,
as discussed in Chapter 20, may also have a role. The technical principles
are identical.
In vitro allergy tests do not substitute for clinical history-taking, examination, and direct patient testing (SPT, patch tests, challenges).

Allergen-speciﬁc IgE
• Units: kAU/mL.
• Range:
• <0.35
=
• 0.35-0.70 =
• 0.70-3.50 =
• 3.50-17.5 =
• 17.5-50.0 =
• 50.0-100 =
• >100
=

RAST score 0
RAST score 1
RAST score 2
RAST score 3
RAST score 4
RAST score 5
RAST score 6

Principles of testing
• Detection of allergen-speciﬁc IgE in the blood is by sensitive RIA, EIA,
or ﬂuorescent assay. There are numerous acronyms for this process,
depending on the method (RAST, MAST, FAST, etc.).
• Radio-immunoassay is now little used.
• Principles of all the tests are identical, with allergen bound to a solid
phase that is then incubated with a labelled anti-IgE antibody.
• The Pharmacia UniCAP/ImmunoCAP system is the most widely used
system in the UK.
• Tests are expensive due to costs of puriﬁcation and standardization of
allergen.
• CE marking requirements have reduced the number of commercially
available allergens.
• EQA and international standards are available.

Indications for testing
• Skin-prick testing (SPT) remains the gold standard.
• In vitro EIA assays may be used for patients with a high risk of
anaphylaxis (SPT contraindicated), drugs that interfere with SPT
(antihistamines, calcium-channel blockers, antidepressants), patients
with extensive skin disease, and small children.
• Patients with a total IgE <20kU/L have a low (but not zero) probability
of having positive speciﬁc IgE tests.

Interpretation
• The assays are carried out quantitatively and reported in units.

ALLERGEN-SPECIFIC IGE

• There is a trend to reporting units rather than grades, although many
laboratories will still report both.
• RAST grades of 0 and 1 are usually considered to indicate a negative
result.
• High total IgE levels (>1000kU/L) may cause false-positive tests for
allergen-speciﬁc IgE, because of non-speciﬁc binding of IgE to the
solid phase. This is less common with newer systems, but applies
particularly to cross-reactive food allergens.
• Units are standardized against an international standard for birch
pollen allergen, but this cannot validly be applied to reactions with
other allergens.
• Attempts are being made to standardize allergens in terms of deﬁned
proteins and protein nitrogen. With a potentially limitless list of
allergens, this is a slow process.
• The important clinical implication is that the detection of a grade 3
response to two different allergens does not indicate that the same
amount of IgE is present against both and that equivalent clinical
reactions might be expected.
• There is no close relationship between the grade and the severity of
reactions (either past or future).
• The presence of allergen-speciﬁc IgE is a marker only of exposure.
• Positives may be detected where there is no evidence of any
clinical reaction.
• Levels will fall with time if the offending allergen is avoided over a
long period, so low or negative results may be obtained even with
sensitized patients.
• As with skin-prick tests, if the allergic reaction is highly localized, there
may be insufﬁcient spillover of speciﬁc IgE into the circulation to be
detected, leading to a false negative.
• Results must always be interpreted in the light of the clinical history
(blood tests are not a substitute for proper history-taking!).

Limitations
• Few allergens are available for robustly identifying IgE to drugs.
• Reagents for penicillin contain major but not minor determinants. A
negative result does not exclude signiﬁcant allergy, and SPT and IDT
are required with a minor determinant mixture.
• Reagents for labile food allergens such as fruits are unreliable. Use SPT
with the fresh fruit.
• Recombinant allergens may assist in the diagnosis, where available
(see Table 19.1 and Chapter 3).
• If there is a good history for type I food allergy and an unexpected
negative result, consider SPT with fresh food.
• 15% of NRL-allergic patients will be negative by speciﬁc IgE testing.

Serial monitoring
• Justiﬁed in cystic ﬁbrosis: screen for IgE to Aspergillus (marker of
colonization and associated with worse prognosis).

535

536

CHAPTER 19

Allergy tests

Component resolved diagnosis
• Key recombinant allergens are now available for the Phadia systems
(Table 19.1).
• Other recombinant food and inhalant allergens are available, but the
precise clinical roles of many still await further clinical studies.
• There may be considerable differences between the results
obtained using tests for whole foods compared with those obtained
using recombinant allergens. For example, the standard soybean
ImmunoCAP contains very little of the recombinant allergen rGly m4
(PR10), an important allergen which is a Bet v1 homologue.

BASOPHIL ACTIVATION TEST

Allergen-speciﬁc IgG antibodies
Principles of testing
• Measured using same techniques as used for speciﬁc IgE (CAP,
UniCAP).
• No EQA or standards are available.

Indications for testing
• Uncertain.
• Possibly for following the response to desensitization therapy.

Interpretation
• It has been suggested that desensitization procedures work, in part,
by producing blocking IgG antibodies which prevent the allergen from
binding to cytophilic IgE:
• these have been identiﬁed as IgG4 subclass.
• XSuccess and duration of desensitization may be determined by
measurement of such antibodies. This is controversial!
• However, it is possible to measure allergen-speciﬁc IgG antibodies to
allergens such as bee or wasp venom, grass pollen, and house dust
mite.
• Whether the results provide any clinically useful information is still
unproven.

Basophil activation test
Principles of testing
• Measured by ﬂow cytometric expression of CD63, a membrane
tetraspanin (deﬁciency in Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome), which is
increased on degranulated basophils.
• Blood is incubated with IL-3 and allergen (with appropriate controls)
and the expression of CD63 is detected by FITC-labelled anti-CD63.
See also ‘Flow-CAST and CAST-ELISA’, p.545.

Indications for testing
• Uncertain.
• This is a very expensive way to test for allergy!

Interpretation
• Depends on proper controls and knowing that there are no nonspeciﬁc degranulating effects of the allergens.

537

538

CHAPTER 19

Allergy tests

CD23, soluble (Fcε receptor)
• Measurement of soluble CD23, the shed form of the Fcε receptor
which has B-cell stimulatory activity, has been proposed as a useful
marker of the activity of chronic allergic disease.
• In asthma, elevated sCD23 may denote underlying chronic
inﬂammatory activity even when the peak ﬂow may be near that
predicted.
• Measurement of this marker cannot yet be recommended without
reservation.
• Assay is by EIA, but is not widely used.

C3a, C4a, and C5a (anaphylotoxins)
See Chapter 17.
• Measurement of the anaphylotoxins may be of value in the
investigation of suspected acute allergic reactions, as a marker of
complement activation.
• This is particularly valuable in circumstances where IgE is not involved
(anaphylactoid reactions).
• Other conditions with raised anaphylotoxins include:
• SLE
• RhA
• HSP and IgA nephropathy
• ARDS
• cardiopulmonary bypass.
• Samples must be collected into Futhan-EDTA, to prevent in vitro
generation of anaphylotoxins.
• These tubes are not readily available.
• Samples need to reach the laboratory quickly as the breakdown
products are labile.
• Value of the tests in clinical practice is limited because of the lack of
ready availability of appropriate tubes.
• Other tests for complement activation may be more appropriate.

Challenge tests
Challenge tests form an important part of the diagnosis of allergic disease.
Clearly, identiﬁcation of the site of the reaction is important. Nasal, bronchial, and oral challenges may be performed. It is wise to avoid challenging
someone who has had a severe systemic reaction or has pre-existing severe
asthma with allergens. As for skin testing, it is essential that patients are
not taking antihistamines and have been off treatment for a period of time
appropriate to the half-life of their antihistamine (up to 4 weeks in some
cases).

CHALLENGE TESTS

• 0 Challenge tests are potentially dangerous and should be carried out
by experienced staff prepared to deal with any adverse reactions that
may arise.
• Informed consent should always be sought from the patient prior to
the test.

Nasal challenge tests
• Usually performed by spraying a dilute solution (1:1000 of SPT
solution) of the test allergen into one nostril, while spraying a similarly
diluted solution of the buffer only into the other nostril.
• Patient’s symptoms are recorded (running nose, sneezing, itching eyes,
etc.) and the nasal mucosa inspected for signs of inﬂammation and
oedema. Each nostril is inspected.
• Process is limited to one allergen at a time, which restricts its use to
conﬁrming sensitivity to a single suspect allergen.
• More complex challenge tests involve measurement of nasal airﬂow
(rhinomanometry), but this is rarely available outside specialist
research centres.

Bronchial challenge tests
• Most common bronchial challenge is with methacholine or histamine.
• Carried out by starting with very dilute solutions and gradually
increasing the dose while measuring the forced expired volume (FEV1)
sequentially.
• Reduction of 20% from the control value is viewed as a positive test
and is indicative of hyper-reactive airways. The dose causing this
reduction is the PD20.
• If a 25mg/mL dose of methacholine is tolerated without achieving a
20% reduction in FEV1, the test is unequivocally negative.
• Allergen solutions may be substituted for methacholine, but the
principles are the same.
• Late reactions may occur 6-8 hours after the challenge as part of
type I response. The patient must be kept under observation for this
period.
• Enthusiasts may carry out an endobronchial challenge through a
bronchoscope, which allows them to observe the changes in the
bronchial mucosa and also to carry out bronchoalveolar lavage to look
at the release of mediators and the cellular response. This is important
in research but not for routine diagnosis.

Food challenge
• Food challenges are complex and must involve an experienced senior
dietician.
• The gold standard is double-blind placebo-controlled (DBPC)
challenge. This is time-consuming.
• The initial step is usually withdrawal of the suspect food(s) followed by
open challenge.

CHAPTER 19

Allergy tests

• For open incremental food challenge, incremental doses of food are
given at 15-minute intervals, with monitoring of blood pressure, PEFR,
and symptoms before each increment.
• Steps are: food on lip (may be omitted), 1%, 4%, 10%, 20%, 20%,
20%, 25% of a normal portion (this may be variable!).
• Over the course of the challenge, 100% of the normal portion size
is administered.
• Where multiple foods are suspected, an oligoallergenic (elimination)
diet may be instituted for a period to see whether symptoms remit. If
symptoms persist, food allergy/intolerance is not the cause.
• If symptoms improve, foods may then be reintroduced one at a time as
open challenges and the patient’s symptom response noted.
• This should ideally be followed by a DBPC challenge where the
patient, on an oligoallergenic diet, is challenged with the suspect
food concealed in opaque gelatin capsules interspersed with identical
capsules containing an innocuous substance in a random sequence
determined by the dietician but unknown to the patient and doctor.
• This is time-consuming, as some food allergic symptoms may require
exposure for several days before they appear and, equally, may take
several days to disappear when the food is withdrawn. There needs to
be a washout period between the placebo and the active capsules.
• A method of scoring symptoms needs to be decided in advance.
• As for bronchial challenges, enthusiasts have directly instilled allergens
into the small bowel and watched for inﬂammatory reactions.

Drug allergy testing
Principles of testing
• Type I reactions are investigated by SPT and intradermal testing (IDT).
• Some drugs are irritants and provoke non-speciﬁc reactions on
IDT.
• Some drugs (opiates, radiocontrast media) cause direct histamine
release from mast cells.
• Only a limited range of tests are available for in vitro testing for IgE to
drugs. Many of the drug allergens are unvalidated in clinical practice.
• Flow cytometric assays of basophil degranulation/activation are
available, but appear to correlate poorly with SPT/IDT testing.
• Type IV reactions are investigated by patch testing.
• Reactions of types II and III are more difﬁcult to investigate.
• Open and blinded challenge tests may be appropriate for atypical
reactions.
• X Patients with Stevens-Johnson reactions must not be tested—
reactions may be severe.
• Testing is time-consuming.

Table 19.2 Starting concentrations and usable dilutions for SPT and IDT (contd.)

EOSINOPHIL CATIONIC PROTEIN (ECP)

• Information on concentrations for other drugs, including plasma
expanders, antibiotics, and steroids, is available from the Regional
Immunology and Allergy Unit, Newcastle-upon-Tyne (Tel: ++44 191
2820740).
• Open drug challenge uses incremental doses.
• 1%, 4%, 10%, 20%, 20%, 20%, 25% of a standard oral dose at
15-minute intervals, with observation of blood pressure, PEFR, and
symptoms before each incremental step.
• Over the period of the challenge, 100% of the normal dose is
administered.

Indications for testing
• Suspected drug allergy, where testing will alter clinical management.
• Do not test where there are readily available and safe alternatives (i.e.
do not test all ‘penicillin-allergic’ patients).

Interpretation
• Interpretation of testing requires the demonstration of wheal and
ﬂare. Reactions to drugs will usually be much smaller than the typical
reactions on SPT/ID to inhalant antigens.
• Photographing the results for the medical records is desirable.
• Knowledge of irritant concentrations is required.
• This may require testing on non-atopic volunteers.
• Clear goals are required for testing:
• testing to prove causality
• testing to prove safety of alternative drugs.
• Information must be provided to the patient as well as the referring
doctor (and GP if referred by other specialist).
• Advice to patient on the use of Medical Alert bracelets may be
required.

Limitations
• Preparation of drug dilutions is time-consuming; assistance from the
pharmacy is required. Preparation of dilutions in clinical areas is not
recommended.
• Where testing is carried out with controlled drugs, appropriate
steps must be taken to account for receipt and disposal of the drugs,
according to local regulations.

Eosinophil cationic protein (ECP)
• ECP is a granule protein of eosinophils, and its presence in serum is a
marker of eosinophil activation.
• It is the neurotoxic agent in Churg-Strauss syndrome.
• Serum levels are elevated in:
• asthma (valuable as a monitoring tool for allergic inﬂammation and
effectiveness of inhaled steroid therapy?)
• other allergic diseases, including urticaria
• Churg-Strauss syndrome (acute active disease).

543

544

CHAPTER 19

Allergy tests

• Synovial ﬂuid levels are increased in:
• rheumatoid arthritis
• ankylosing spondylitis.
• Urine levels are increased by carcinoma of the bladder.
• CSF levels are increased by malignant but not benign tumours.
• Levels correlate with the degree of underlying inﬂammation.
• Assay requires timed separation of samples, although the assay itself
uses very similar methodology to that used for detecting allergenspeciﬁc IgE:
• ECP may be released during the coagulation process
• this signiﬁcantly limits the usefulness of the test.

Eosinophil count
• Units: cells × 109/L.
• Normal range:
• Newborn, <0.85×109/L;
• Children 1-3 years, <0.70×109/L
• Children >3 and adults, <0.44×109/L.

Principles of testing
• Routinely on the newer automated haematology counters, which are
capable of providing a ﬁve-part differential. Where older counters
are used, an additional manual differential with special stains may be
required.

Indications
•
•
•
•
•

Allergic disease, including drug reactions.
Lymphoma.
Vasculitis.
Pulmonary inﬁltrates.
Parasitic infection.

Interpretation
• Raised eosinophil counts are not speciﬁc for allergic disease; counts
>10×109/L are not due to allergy or parasitic disease.
• Moderate elevations are seen in:
• parasitic infestations
• drug reactions
• lymphoma (especially Hodgkin’s lymphoma)
• after radiation therapy
• vasculitides (Churg-Strauss vasculitis, polyarteritis nodosa)
• dermatitis herpetiformis
• primary immunodeﬁciencies (Omenn’s syndrome, materno-fetal
engraftment—see Chapter 1)
• hepatic cirrhosis.

HISTAMINE-RELEASE ASSAYS

• Exceptionally high eosinophil counts are seen in:
• larva migrans
• hypereosinophilic syndromes
• severe vasculitis (CSS, PAN) and occasionally in lymphoma and
cirrhosis.
• Eosinophil count is reduced by acute infection, stress, fasting for more
than 24 hours, and corticosteroids.
• Examination of nasal and conjunctival secretions for the presence of
eosinophils may provide conﬁrmatory evidence for an allergic cause
for local symptoms.
• Eosinophilia of nasal secretions may be seen in non-allergic rhinitis
(non-allergic rhinitis with eosinophils (NARES)).

Flow-CAST® and CAST-ELISA®
• These commercial assays rely on activation of basophils either directly
or via speciﬁc IgE in the patient’s serum.
• CAST-ELISA® measures the release of sulphidoleukotrienes by
activated basophils by EIA.
• Assay is extremely slow and time-consuming and is impractical for a
busy diagnostic laboratory.
• The Flow-CAST® uses ﬂow cytometry to identify basophils, labelled
with anti-IgE-FITC, and then anti-CD63-PE, a marker of activated
basophils, which identiﬁes basophil degranulation.
• Manufacturer provides an array of speciﬁc allergens including food
additives and drugs.
• Both assays work well for normal inhalant allergens, but appear less
useful for drugs and additives.
• Modiﬁcation of the Flow-CAST® assay using anti-CD203c in place of
anti-CD63 improves the characteristics of the assay.
• Results for drug allergens compare poorly with those from IDT.
• The assays cannot therefore be recommended as a non-invasive way
of testing for drug allergy.
• Assays are more expensive and labour-intensive than standard EIA for
routine inhalant allergens.

Histamine-release assays
• In vitro release of histamine by basophils in response to stimulation by
cytokines or by allergens is a complex test.
• Measurement of free histamine is required (difﬁcult as it is labile in
serum/plasma).
• Assays are of value in the research setting.
• In the clinical setting assays have been used for investigating the
histamine-releasing properties of certain drugs.
• Like all bioassays, they suffer from difﬁculties in standardization.

545

546

CHAPTER 19

Allergy tests

Immunoglobulin E (total IgE)
• Units: kU/L.
• Normal ranges:
- age <1 year,
- age <2 years,
- age 2-3 years,
- age 4-5 years,
- age 6-7 years,
- age 8-10 years,
- age 11-12 years,
- age 13-14 years,
- age >14 years,

<11kU/L
<29kU/L
<42kU/L
<52kU/L
<56kU/L
<63kU/L
<45kU/L
<70kU/L
<100kU/L.

Principles of testing
• Usually the same as for allergen-speciﬁc IgE (RIA, EIA).
• Some nephelometers have the capacity to run total IgE.

Indications for testing
•
•
•
•
•

Allergic disease (as screen for atopic tendency).
Lymphoma.
Vasculitis (Churg-Strauss vasculitis).
Primary immunodeﬁciency.
Myeloma.

Interpretation
• Measurement of total IgE may be helpful in diagnosing allergic disease.
• Normal range is very wide and levels correlate poorly with clinical
disease.
• High level of speciﬁc IgE to a single allergen may occur with a total IgE
within the ‘normal’ range.
• In asthmatic patients, a level >150kU/L is suggestive of an allergic basis,
while a level <20kU/L is very much against it. The severity of asthmatic
symptoms correlates very poorly with total IgE (but better with
eosinophil count).
• In the investigation of dermatitis, a level >400kU/L is usual, while a
level <20kU/L is against atopic dermatitis.
• Very high levels of IgE are seen in atopic eczema, allergic
bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA), parasitic infections (larva
migrans, hookworm, schistosomiasis, and ﬁlariasis), lymphoma
(especially Hodgkin’s disease), and liver disease.
• Levels may be elevated in EBV infection, the Churg-Strauss syndrome,
systemic sclerosis, and bullous pemphigoid, although this is a poor
marker of disease activity.
• Some primary immunodeﬁciencies are associated with raised IgE, such
as Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome and Omenn’s syndrome.
• Highest levels are seen in the hyper-IgE syndrome (Job syndrome,
Buckley’s syndrome) where levels frequently exceed 50 000kU/L, a
level rarely, if ever, seen in atopic disease.

MAST-CELL TRYPTASE

• IgE myeloma is exceedingly rare: diagnosis will have been made on
electrophoresis and immunoﬁxation.
• Levels are often higher in Asians, although it is not clear whether this
is just because of a higher risk of parasitic diseases.

Limitations
• Speciﬁc IgE testing becomes inaccurate with very high levels of IgE
(>1000kU/L) because of non-speciﬁc binding.
• Conversely, where the total IgE is very low, it is not useful to perform
tests for speciﬁc IgE.

Serial monitoring
• Justiﬁed in ABPA (a rise in the level of IgE precedes relapse, and the
level falls with appropriate therapy).
• Justiﬁed in Churg-Strauss syndrome (responds to therapy).

IgE autoantibodies/IgE receptor
antibodies
• These have been reported in patients with allergic problems.
• Antibodies to the IgE receptor have been reported as a possible cause
of chronic urticaria, although the evidence is very weak.
• Routine assays are not available at present, and clinical utility needs to
be conﬁrmed in further studies.
• The use of the autologous serum test is said to depend upon these
autoantibodies.

IgG to food allergens
• IgG antibodies to food allergens are available (UniCAP®/ImmunoCAP®).
• It has been suggested that these may be valuable in the investigation of
irritable bowel syndrome (IgG to wheat, milk).
• IgG to food allergens occur frequently in healthy individuals, especially
against bovine, ovine, and porcine proteins.
• Clinical value remains to be determined.

Mast-cell tryptase
• Units: μg/L.
• Normal adult range: 2-14μg/L.

Sample
• Serum, preferably on several occasions within a 24-hour period after
an acute reaction (tryptase is stable in serum).

Principles of testing
• Measured by Pharmacia UniCAP® system (EIA).

547

548

CHAPTER 19

Allergy tests

Indications for testing
• Conﬁrmation of mast-cell degranulation (a speciﬁc marker of mast-cell
granules).
• Investigation of atypical ‘allergic’ reactions.

Interpretation
• Does not distinguish between anaphylactic and anaphylactoid
reactions.
• False-positive elevations due to herophile antibodies (rheumatoid
factors) have been reported.
• Relatively stable in serum, being catabolized in the liver with a half-life
of approximately 3 hours.
• Levels may be signiﬁcantly raised for 24 hours after an acute reaction
involving mast-cell degranulation.
• Good correlation between plasma histamine and mast-cell tryptase
makes mast-cell tryptase the preferred marker for mast-cell activation.
• Persistently elevated levels may be seen in patients with urticaria
pigmentosa and systemic mastocytosis.
• Elevated levels may also be detected in nasal and bronchial lavage
ﬂuids after allergen challenge.
• In order to assess the signiﬁcance of a result taken during an acute
reaction in a given patient, it is important to take a sample when the
patient has fully recovered.
• Levels may not be elevated if there is a signiﬁcant dilution due to
administration of IV ﬂuids.
• Post-mortem femoral blood samples may show elevations in
anaphylactic deaths. Levels have been reported to be raised in some
cases of sudden infant death syndrome and in blood samples taken
from heart as opposed to vein. Asphyxia activates mast cells.

Omalizumab monitoring by
basophil-bound IgE
Sample
• EDTA: pre-treatment sample is required to assess baseline expression.

Principles of testing
• Measured by ﬂow cytometry
• Basophils are identiﬁed by using anti-CD45 and anti-CD203c
(recognizes the ectoenzyme E-NPP3).
• Anti-IgE to identify basophil bound IgE.
• Baseline measurement pre-treatment is required.

Indications for testing
• Conﬁrmation of satisfactory reduction of basophil-bound IgE.
• Useful where there is concern about response.

Interpretation
• By 2 weeks following infusion, basophil-bound IgE should be
approximately 10% of pre-treatment level.

PATCH TESTING

Patch testing
The purpose of patch testing is to identify type IV hypersensitivity, usually
in the context of contact hypersensitivity to environmental agents.

Principles of testing
• As for SPT, an area of normal skin is required. The upper and middle
zone of the back is usually appropriate.
• Allergens are made up in petrolatum jelly or in aqueous solution on a
ﬁlter paper and applied under occlusion in a small metal chamber (Finn
chamber), which is secured ﬁrmly to the back with hypoallergenic
tape.
• Chambers are left in place for 48 hours and the patients are told not
to wash the area.
• When the chambers are removed, the application areas are inspected
for erythema, vesiculation, and evidence of cellular inﬁltrate.
• There may be false positives due to type I and III reactions at this
stage.
• The sites should be re-read at 72-96 hours.
• False-positive reactions at 48 hours will have disappeared on the
later reading.
• It is usual for a standard panel to be used in the initial screen, unless
there are clear indications of the most likely allergens (e.g. through the
occupation and exposure history, site of eczema, etc.).
• Standard panel will include metals (nickel, chromium),
preservatives, fragrances, rubber mix, lanolin, formaldehyde, balsam
of Peru, and colophony.
• Where there are positive reactions to one of the mixed reagents
(rubber mix, fragrances), there are usually supplementary panels of the
individual ingredients.
• If the patient is exposed to an unusual substance, then it or its
contents can be made into extemporaneous patch tests, provided that
appropriate safety data can be obtained from the manufacturers.
• Some allergens only cause reactions when there is concomitant
exposure to sunlight. This can be reproduced in the clinic using a
photopatch test.
• Duplicates of each allergen are applied, and after 24-48 hours one
of the pair is taken off and the back is exposed to UVA light (10
joules).
• The other one of the pair is then taken off and the sites are read as
for an ordinary patch test.
• The unexposed member of the pair serves as the control.

Indications for testing
• Contact eczema or dermatitis.
• Tests are only appropriate for delayed hypersensitivity (type IV).
• Patch testing for drugs may be valuable where reactions are atypical
and delayed.

549

550

CHAPTER 19

Allergy tests

• Patch tests have been used for food allergens in the context of foodprotein enterocolitis and eosinophilic gastroenteritis syndromes. The
utility is uncertain.

Interpretation
• Results can be roughly graded as:
• 0, no response
• 1+, erythema and oedema
• 2+, erythema, papules, and small vesicles
• 3+, marked erythema, induration, and large blisters.
• Grades 2+ and 3+ are positive.
• Antihistamines have no effect on the responses, but topical steroids
applied to the sites of application or systemic steroids will signiﬁcantly
reduce or abolish the responses.

Skin-prick testing (SPT)/intradermal
testing (IDT) 1
• This remains the most cost-effective method for determining whether
someone is sensitized to an allergen.
• SPT is appropriate for most circumstances.
• IDT, using diluted solutions, can be used for drugs and venoms, where
SPT gives equivocal or negative responses.

Principles of testing
• SPT has the major advantage that the patient sees the results as they
develop, and it takes only 15 minutes to read:
• positive and negative reinforcement.
• Testing can be carried out by either prick testing or intradermal testing.
• IDT is more sensitive, but involves the injection of a larger amount of
allergen:
• adverse reactions are more common.
• Both tests depend on the release of histamine from sensitized mast cells.
• Tests will give spurious results in patients taking antihistamines.
• Short-acting antihistamines should be stopped at least 48 hours
before testing.
• Long-acting antihistamines should be stopped for at least 7 days.
• Astemizole and terfenadine produce such prolonged blockade that
four drug-free weeks are required to give meaningful SPT results
(both drugs withdrawn in the UK due to effect on QT interval).
• If there is doubt, run histamine control ﬁrst to assess response.
• Other drugs that interfere with testing include:
• tricyclic antidepressants
• mirtazapine
• calcium-channel-blocking drugs.
• Topical steroids do not signiﬁcantly interfere with testing.
• Preferred site for SPT/IDT testing is the volar aspect of the forearm.
• Distribution of mast cells is variable and decreases up the arm.

SKIN-PRICK TESTING (SPT)/INTRADERMAL TESTING (IDT) 1

•

•

•
•
•
•

• The back may be used but reactivity is lower than on the arm.
• Whealing diminishes with age.
• Patients with dermographism or extensive skin disease are
unsuitable for testing.
For prick testing, the allergens are applied as a single small drop, which
is pricked through with a slight lifting motion to a uniform depth with a
sharp lancet.
• A separate lancet should be used for each allergen and disposed of
immediately.
• It is poor practice to use a single lancet and wipe it between
allergens, as this may give misleading results due to crosscontamination.
• A histamine control (1 or 10mg/mL for SPT and 0.01mg/mL for
IDT) and negative control (glycerinated carrier) should always be
applied.
• Tests are read at 15 minutes.
• The size of the wheal (not the surrounding ﬂare) is measured.
• Positive control should give a response of at least 4mm.
• Positive test results require that it is at least 2mm greater than the
negative control.
• It is helpful to place a strip of wide Micropore tape over the test
sites and draw round the wheal.
• This gives a permanent record that can be transferred to the notes,
and allows calculation when the wheal is an eccentric shape.
• For irregular wheals, the diameter across the widest part can be
measured and then the diameter at right angles.
IDT exposes patients to doses 100-1000-fold higher than SPT.
• A dose (0.02mL) of diluted allergen (a 100-fold dilution of the
SPT reagent) is injected intradermally with the test read at 15-30
minutes.
• Other dilutions may be used (drugs), often with an incremental
scale.
• If multiple IDTs are carried out at the same time with positive
results, the cumulative effect may lead to systemic symptoms.
There is no agreed standardization of the reagents for SPT/IDT in
terms of reactivity and allergen content.
Allergen solutions may express the allergen concentration in protein
nitrogen units (PNU) or as weight/volume.
Standardization is best carried out by immunochemical methods such
as RAST inhibition which will give a biological potency (BU/mL).
Consistent results will be obtained if trained staff carry out all tests.

Indications for testing
• SPT is the gold standard for allergy diagnosis and should be considered
as the ﬁrst choice for testing.
• Testing should be driven by clinical symptoms. the use of routine
panels of allergens on every patient is wasteful and can be misleading
(irrelevant positives).
• Where no commercial antigens are available, direct SPT (prick to
prick) with allergens such as foods may be desirable.

551

552

CHAPTER 19

Allergy tests

• This is the test of choice for fruit and vegetable allergens that are
labile.
• IDT is used to follow up SPT, particularly for drug allergy
investigations.

SPT/IDT 2: interpretation and
limitations
Interpretation
• As sensitization depends on circulating IgE reaching the mast cells
at the test site, it is possible, where the allergic reaction is highly
localized, to get negative results as insufﬁcient IgE is present in the
circulation.
• Positive reactions on SPT do not necessarily equate to clinical disease.
• All results must be interpreted in the context of the clinical history.
• If the negative control comes up positive, or if the histamine control
produces no reaction, the tests are impossible to interpret.
• Test results greater than the ‘positive’ negative control might be
considered positive. This is risky, and conﬁrmatory blood tests should
be undertaken.
• False-positive tests may often be found to food allergens, although the
rate is lower with SPT than IDT.
• Where commercial food allergens give an unexpected false negative,
use of the fresh food may be possible.
• Allergen solutions to a wide range of allergens are available
commercially from several manufacturers.
• They should be checked regularly to see that they are still within date.

Limitations
• If patients cannot stop their antihistamines, then blood tests may be
the only way of diagnosis.
• It is advisable to avoid any form of skin testing in patients known
to have had a severe systemic reaction to any of the proposed test
agents.
• The small amount of allergen introduced during SPT may be
enough to trigger a reaction in a susceptible individual.
• 0 Skin testing should only be carried out by staff familiar with
resuscitation and with appropriate facilities close at hand.

URINARY METHYL HISTAMINE

Thromboxanes and prostaglandins
• Assays of these short-lived mediators are available in the research
setting but do not have much applicability to the routine management
of allergic problems at the present time.
• Assays are usually by RIA.

Unvalidated tests
• A large number of other tests are used for the purported diagnosis of
allergic disease, often without conventional medical services.
• These are frequently promoted directly to the public.
• Many of these techniques have not been validated scientiﬁcally
or use techniques that will not identify allergy as understood by
immunologists.
• ‘Allergy’ therapies may be offered as a result of such testing. Members
of the public may be offered ‘allergy treatments’ based on the results
of these tests.
• Publications reviewing these tests include the following.
• Royal College of Physicians: Allergy—conventional and alternative
concepts.
• joint publication of RCP, RCPath, and BSACI: Good allergy practice.
• www.quackwatch.com is a valuable website for up-to-date refutation
of unscientiﬁc testing.
• Tests where there is limited or no current evidence of value in the
diagnosis of IgE-mediated allergic disease include
• provocation-neutralization
• hair analysis
• Vega analysis
• kinesiology
• iridology
• auriculo-cardiac reﬂex
• leucocytotoxic testing.

Urinary methyl histamine
• Histamine release from mast cells is a key feature of acute severe
allergic reactions.
• It is rapidly cleared in the circulation. Therefore measurement of free
histamine is difﬁcult and limited to research settings.

553

554

CHAPTER 19

Allergy tests

• The urinary metabolite N-methyl histamine is stable and therefore is
useful in determining whether mast-cell degranulation has taken place
in an acute reaction.
• The commercial assay and consequently the routine clinical service
from the Supra-Regional Protein Reference Units has been withdrawn.
• Mast-cell tryptase is available as an alternative.
• Renal function must also be known to evaluate results.

Venom-speciﬁc IgE and IgG
• Measurement of speciﬁc IgE to bee and wasp venom is an essential
investigation in suspected insect sting allergy.
• This is carried out as for other allergen-speciﬁc IgE tests (see
‘Allergen-speciﬁc IgE’, p.534).
• The use of recombinant allergens may assist in diagnosis by excluding
reactivity to cross-reactive carbohydrate determinants.
• Negative results may occur with the in vitro assays.
• SPT with incremental concentrations of venom may be required:
• incremental SPT for bee and wasp venom can be carried out with
solutions of 10, 100, and 300μg/mL.
• IDT with dilute venom may occasionally be required:
• 10-fold steps from 0.0001 to 1μg/mL.
• Measurement of venom-speciﬁc IgG may be helpful in determining
the success of desensitization (see ‘Allergen-speciﬁc IgG antibodies’,
p.537).

CHAPTER 20

Cellular investigations

Introduction
• Cellular investigations include:
• identiﬁcation of cell-surface phenotype
• identiﬁcation of intracellular proteins
• identiﬁcation of cellular function, including activation
• identiﬁcation of secreted products (cytokines, chemokines)
• identiﬁcation of abnormal cellular constituents (leukaemia/
lymphoma).
• Techniques used include:
• EIA and RIA (see Chapters 17 and 18)
• ﬂow cytometry
• tissue culture
• PAGE
• genetic techniques (see Chapter 21), mainly PCR-based techniques.
• Few functional assays are standardized and gold standard assays have
not been deﬁned.
• EQA exists only for basic lymphocyte phenotyping and then only in
the context of testing for HIV.

Flow cytometry
Flow cytometry provides the cornerstone of diagnostic cellular immunology and depends on the availability of monoclonal antibody reagents
that react with human surface and intracellular antigens. Fluorescent intercalating dyes can be used to detect DNA semi-quantitatively (for cell cycle
analysis).
• The technique involves the ﬂow of ﬂuorescent-labelled cells past the
exciting laser and subsequent detectors.
• Method is only applicable to single-cell suspensions, e.g. bloodderived cells or cultured cells.
• It is possible to use disaggregated solid tissues, such as tumours.
• Modern ﬂow cytometers use a single exciting laser (monochromatic
light) and can detect multiple different wavelengths of light emitted by
ﬂuorescent dyes.
• There are detectors for forward and 90° light scatter, which are
related to cell size and cell granularity, respectively.
• Software permits complex multiparameter gating and analysis,
including real-time data collection and analysis.
• Fluorescent-conjugated monoclonal antibodies are used against surface
antigens.
• Cell permeabilization techniques are available to enable staining of
intracellular antigens.
• Surface and intracellular stains can be combined.
• Appropriate controls are required to detect non-speciﬁc staining.
• The major advantage of ﬂow cytometry for analysis is that it is semiautomated and can analyse very large numbers of cells very rapidly
compared with ﬂuorescence microscopy. It is much more accurate.

PROLIFERATION ASSAYS

• Accurate absolute counts are available on single-platform analysers
using bead technology. This obviates the errors from using
haematology counter total lymphocyte counts.
• Regular calibration of the instrument is required, and it is essential that
compensation between the ﬂuorescence detectors is correctly set up.
This is done with beads of known ﬂuorescence.

Tissue culture
• In vitro functional studies of cells may require puriﬁed cells (blood,
other ﬂuids).
• This is done by density gradient centrifugation, using Ficoll,
metrizamide, or dextran solutions.
• The different buoyant densities of blood cells permit separation
when blood is centrifuged through the dense medium.
• Further puriﬁcation of lymphocyte populations can be undertaken
using:
• rosetting with sheep red cells
• magnetic separation using monoclonal antibodies coupled to
magnetic microspheres.
• The more cells are handled in vitro, the more their characteristics are
altered.
• This affects activation parameters in particular.
• Cell culture is usually carried out in tissue-culture medium
supplemented with:
• antibiotics to prevent contamination with bacteria
• fetal calf serum (FCS) or human AB serum (no isoagglutinins)
• other ‘black-box’ factors that are required for optimal cell growth
(glutamine is added as this is labile).
• Where proliferation assays are being carried out, it is essential to
screen the FCS ﬁrst, as some batches are mitogenic in their own right.
• Good sterile technique is essential.
• Culture is carried out in a 37°C humidiﬁed incubator, with a controlled
atmosphere (usually 5% CO2) to maintain pH.
• Many different types of tissue culture media are available. Most contain
pH buffers (bicarbonate) and pH indicators.

Proliferation assays
• There are numerous mitogenic stimuli that can be used (see ‘T-cell
function: in vitro assays’, p.570).
• These are added at the initiation of the culture.
• Cells are pulsed with tritiated thymidine, which is taken up into newly
synthesized DNA in dividing cells: this remains the gold standard.
• Cells are then harvested onto ﬁlter papers and exposed to scintillant
ﬂuid.
• Counts per minute are determined using a beta-counter.

557

558

CHAPTER 20

Cellular investigations

• Alternative assays have been described using ﬂow cytometers (no
radio-isotopes):
• CD69 expression
• DNA analysis with intercalating dyes (cell cycle analysis).
• These do not give comparable results to those from tritiated
thymidine uptake and appear less sensitive.

Immunohistology
• Immunoperoxidase and other enzymatic immunostains are used in the
diagnosis of lymph-node disease.
• Multiple monoclonal antibodies which recognize different stages of
lymphoid development or particular subsets of cells are used.
• Many of the antibodies used will also work on parafﬁn-embedded
sections, but this depends on whether the target antigen is stable
under the conditions of ﬁxation. Frozen sections are better at present.
• In situ hybridization is used to detect viral nucleic acid (EBV, other
herpesviruses).

Cytokine, chemokine, soluble protein
assays
• Detection of speciﬁc cellular products, such as antibodies, cytokines,
and shed surface molecules (soluble CD8 etc.) are usually undertaken
using EIA or RIA techniques, as described in Chapter 18.
• Cytokines may also be detected by bioassays using cell lines whose
growth depends on a given cytokine.
• Strictly, both types of assay should be used, as EIA techniques may give
spurious results due to naturally occurring cytokine-binding proteins in
serum (soluble receptors, binding factors).
• Bioassays are notoriously difﬁcult to standardize and reproduce, and
are not suited to routine diagnostic use.
• Detection of intracellular cytokines with ﬂuorescently labelled
monoclonal antibodies in permeabilized cells has been used in
conjunction with surface staining.
• This does not indicate that the cytokines are secreted and
therefore does not equate to functional assays of cytokines.

Apoptosis assays
Principles of testing
• Flow cytometric assays exist for identiﬁcation of degraded DNA in
apoptotic cells.
• Preferred method is the TUNEL method, using ﬂuorescent
nucleotides enzyme-inserted into DNA strand breaks present in
apoptotic cells. Commercial assays are available.

ADHESION MARKERS

• Fluorochrome-conjugated annexin V can be used to detect
surface phosphatidylserine which is exposed on the cell surface in
apoptotic cells, but not in normal cells.
• Expression of fas and fas-ligand by ﬂow cytometry.
• A functional assay is available using PHA+IL-2 stimulated T cells.
These express high levels of Fas and can be induced to apoptose by
the addition of Fas-ligand. Co-staining with annexin V (apoptotic cells)
and propidium iodide (identiﬁes dead cells) allows the response of the
patient’s cells to be compared with a normal control. To improve the
reliability of the assay, multiple dilutions of fas ligand are used.
• Protein and molecular follow-up tests are required to conﬁrm defects:
few PID centres have the capacity to run the necessary assays.

Indications for testing
• Suspected apoptotic defect (ALPS, caspase deﬁciency).

Interpretation
• Careful use of controls is required.
• Samples must be run fresh.
• Microscopic conﬁrmation of assay results is advised to exclude
artefacts.

Adhesion markers
Principles of testing
• Flow cytometry.
• Analysis should be carried out with CD18, CD11a (LFA-1), CD11b
(Mac-1, CR3), and CD11c (CR4) for LAD-1, and CD15 for LAD-2.
Neutrophils and lymphocytes should be tested.
• Stimulation studies for upregulation in the presence of PMA or G-IFN
may be required where there is partial expression of CD18.

Indications for testing
• Suspected leucocyte adhesion molecule deﬁciency (see Chapter 1).

Interpretation
• LAD-1 is associated normally with deﬁciency of CD18, the common
B-chain for the integrins, which leads to absence of CD11a, CD11b,
and CD11c, as well as CD18.
• Absence of B-chains has been reported but is extremely rare.
• LAD-2 is exceptionally rare and is associated with deﬁciency of the
hapten-X receptor on neutrophils (CD15).
• Under certain circumstances it may be appropriate to look at the
expression of the other complement receptors: CR1 (expressed on
red cells, eosinophils, and B cells) and CR2 (CD21, EBV receptor
expressed on B cells, NK cells, and follicular dendritic cells).
• Reduction of red cell CR1 has been found in SLE.
• Some patients with CVID may lack CD21 on some of their B cells.

559

560

CHAPTER 20

Cellular investigations

Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) studies
• Normal adult values for non-smokers:
• total cells, 130-180×103/mL
• macrophages, 80-95%
• lymphocytes, <15%
• neutrophils, <3%
• eosinophils, <0.5%.
• Normal adult values for smokers:
• total cells, 300-500×103/mL
• macrophages, 85-98%
• lymphocytes, <10%
• neutrophils, <5%
• eosinophils, <3%.

Principles of testing
• Cells recovered from bronchi by saline lavage during bronchoscopy
can be stained and counted using neat BAL ﬂuid. Total count and
percentage differential counts are required.
• Subsets of lymphocytes can be analysed by ﬂow cytometry.

Indications for testing
•
•
•
•
•
•

Unexplained interstitial lung disease.
Sarcoidosis.
Hypersensitivity pneumonitis.
Idiopathic pulmonary ﬁbrosis (IPF).
Eosinophilic granuloma.
Connective tissue diseases.

Interpretation
• In sarcoidosis, there is a marked increase in lymphocytes (to about
30% of the total cells), predominantly CD4+ T cells, giving a CD4:CD8
ratio (which is normally 2:1) of between 4:1 and 10:1.
• Values improve with treatment, but the levels and the ratio do not
predict the severity of the disease.
• Occasionally there is an increase in neutrophils and mast cells,
which is said to indicate a poorer prognosis.
• In hypersensitivity pneumonitis, the BAL lymphocytosis comprises
mainly CD8+ cells, with the highest levels occurring in the acutely
exposed.
• In IPF, a neutrophilia in excess of 10%, particularly if there is an
increase in eosinophils, is associated with a poor prognosis.
• A lymphocytosis (a rare ﬁnding) is associated with a better
prognosis and indicates a probable response to steroids.
• In eosinophilic granuloma (histiocytosis X), there is an increase in
OKT6-positive (S-100, CD1+) histiocytic cells, up to 20% of total cells,
which is diagnostic.

COMPLEMENT MEMBRANE REGULATORY FACTORS

CD40 ligand expression
Principles of testing
• Flow cytometry is used to demonstrate upregulation of expression of
CD40-ligand (CD154) upon stimulation of T cells in vitro with mitogens
(PMA).
• CD69 expression is used as an activation control.

Indications for testing
• Suspected CD40-ligand deﬁciency.

Interpretation
• Gating stimulated cells can be difﬁcult because of clumping and size
changes: this makes the activation control important.
• Variants of CD40-ligand deﬁciency have been identiﬁed in which there
is normal upregulation of non-functional ligand. Normal results do not
exclude the diagnosis.
• Failure of upregulation is highly suggestive of CD40-ligand deﬁciency.
• Abnormal results should be followed up with genetic testing for
mutations in the CD40-ligand gene.

Complement membrane regulatory
factors
Principles of testing
• Flow cytometry is now used exclusively.
• Functional assays of cell lysis (Ham’s test) have been withdrawn.

Indications for testing
• Suspected paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria.

Interpretation
• Deﬁciencies of a group of surface proteins with an unusual glycosylphosphatidylinositol membrane binding are associated with paroxysmal
nocturnal haemoglobinuria (PNH).
• This is a clonal disorder leading to unusual susceptibility to
homologous complement lysis, particularly of red cells.
• The proteins in question are regulatory proteins which prevent
destruction of cells by homologous complement and include:
• decay accelerating factor (DAF, CD55)
• homologous restriction factor-20 (HRF20, CD59)
• C8-binding protein (HRF65)
• acetylcholinesterase.

561

562

CHAPTER 20

Cellular investigations

Cytokine and cytokine receptor
measurement
Principles of testing
• Enzyme immunoassay (serum, cell culture supernatant).
• Bioassay.
• Flow cytometry for intracellular cytokines; surface staining for
receptors.
• Immunoblotting.
• In vitro stimulation assays with mycobacterial and salmonella antigens
may be required to demonstrate defects.
• Elispot assays can identify speciﬁc cytokine production in response to
stimulation.

Indications for testing
• Only absolute indication is suspected cytokine/cytokine receptor
deﬁciency (e.g. IL-12, G-IFN receptor deﬁciencies).
• Intracellular cytokines have been used to identify functional Th1/Th2
balance.

Interpretation
• EIA assays are unreliable because of the presence of natural cytokinebinding proteins and soluble receptors.
• Bioassays are difﬁcult to standardize, time-consuming, and unsuitable
for routine diagnostic use.
• IL-6 rises very early in acute-phase responses, before a rise in the CRP
can be detected. However:
• CRP is readily available and an is acceptable surrogate for IL-6
• CRP levels are raised in myeloma, reﬂecting elevated IL-6
• CRP levels are also raised in Castleman’s syndrome, reﬂecting
raised IL-6.
• Cytokine and cytokine receptor deﬁciencies are exceptionally rare
(see Chapter 1).
• Flow cytometric tests for intracellular cytokine detection are available.
• Technique works well for IL-2 and G-IFN but poorly for IL-4.
• It has the signiﬁcant advantage that speciﬁc T-cell subpopulations
can be studied using multicolour ﬂow cytometry.

Cytotoxic T cells
• Cytotoxic T cells can be generated during a one-way mixed
lymphocyte reaction (sMLR), stimulating the responding cells with
irradiated or mitomycin-treated allogeneic target cells and then
assessing the ability of the responders to kill Cr51-labelled targets, in a
similar assay to the NK-cell assay (see ‘NK-cell function’, p.575).
• This is a complex and ﬁddly assay, and has been used mainly as part of
the cross-matching procedure (see Chapter 21).

GENETIC AND PROTEIN STUDIES

FOXP3 (regulatory T cells—IPEX
syndrome)
Principles of testing
• Flow cytometric test to detect the presence of regulatory T cells
(Treg) by intracellular detection of FOXP3.
• This requires a permeabilization step on separated lymphocytes.
• Treg are FOXP3+ CD4+ CD25bright and CD127weak (CD127 is IL-7
receptor-A).

Indications for testing
• Investigation of suspected IPEX syndrome (see Chapter 1).

Interpretation
• Assays that involve permeabilization of separated lymphocytes are
intrinsically more prone to technical problems.
• The assay must be run on fresh samples with a normal control.
• This is a screening, not a quantitative, assay and will also pick up
non-functional FOXP3—essential to do follow-up genetic analysis.

Genetic and protein studies
• Protein and genetic studies are essential for the identiﬁcation of gene
defects in primary immunodeﬁciencies.
• Surface proteins and some intracellular proteins, relevant to the
diagnosis of primary immune deﬁciencies, can be identiﬁed by ﬂow
cytometry.
• Protein studies, including surface and intracellular protein detection,
are frequently used as a screening test prior to genetic testing, e.g. for:
• XLA (BTK)
• CGD (phox proteins)
• CD40 ligand deﬁciency
• IPEX (FOXP3)
• ICOS deﬁciency (ICOS)
• SAP, XIAP
• CD3ζ.
• Abnormal protein expression should be followed up by molecular
mutation analysis.
• Molecular analysis is also required where there is a high degree of
clinical suspicion but apparently normal protein expression (expression
of non-functional protein).
• Family studies are valuable to identify asymptomatic carriers, who can
then receive appropriate counselling.

563

564

CHAPTER 20

Cellular investigations

Leukaemia phenotyping
Leukaemia phenotyping is undertaken to identify the origin of the malignant cell and the presence or absence of markers that are known to be of
prognostic signiﬁcance. This will always be undertaken in conjunction with
other studies, including examinations of blood ﬁlms, bone marrow smears,
and trephines stained for enzymatic cytoplasmic and membrane markers.

Principles of testing
• Flow cytometry of peripheral blood and bone marrow:
• surface markers
• intracellular markers.
• Morphology on peripheral blood and bone marrow.
• Enzymatic studies.
• Molecular studies:
• oncogene expression
• Ig heavy chain and Tcr gene rearrangements
• karyotype and chromosomal abnormalities.

Indications for testing
• Suspected leukaemia or pre-leukaemia.

Interpretation
• Diagnosis depends on the use of multiple markers and techniques.
• Follow-up panels may be required (see next section).
• Leukaemic cells often correspond to particular stages of cellular
differentiation, which can be matched to normal cell ontogeny.
• Aberrant antigens, expressed out of sequence, may occur.
• This may give rise to biphenotypic leukaemias.
• Bone marrow studies are complex because of the very different lightscattering properties of the cellular constituents.
• Familiarity with the patterns of antigen expression at each stage of
differentiation for each lineage is required.
• Re-examination of bone marrow after treatment is important to detect
the presence of minimal residual disease. This can be done using the
following techniques.
• Flow cytometry, which can detect one leukaemic cell in 10 000
cells.
• PCR techniques where the leukaemic cells carry an abnormal
genetic marker (oncogene) or have a speciﬁc rearrangement of
either the immunoglobulin (B lineage) or T-cell receptor (T lineage)
genes. These techniques are even more sensitive.
• Flow cytometric karyotyping is now possible as an alternative to
molecular techniques.

Leukaemia phenotyping panel
A primary panel for acute leukaemias will usually include the following.
• B lineage:
• CD10 (CALLA), CD19, CD24, HLA-DR, cytoplasmic Ig (μ heavy
chains) and surface Ig.

LYMPHOCYTE SUBSETS

• T lineage:
• CD2, cytoplasmic CD3, CD7.
• Lymphoblast:
• TdT.
• AML lineage:
• CD13, CD14, CD33.
• Erythroid:
• glycophorin A.
• Megakaryocyte:
• CD41.
A secondary panel may be used in difﬁcult cases and may include the
following.
• B lineage:
• cytoplasmic CD22.
• T lineage:
• CD1, CD3, CD4, CD8.
• AML:
• CD15, cytoplasmic myeloperoxidase.
For chronic lymphoid disorders the panel will be slightly different, as
follows.
• B lineage, primary:
• CD10, CD20, CD5, surface Ig.
• B lineage, secondary:
• CD11c, CD25, CD38, and FMC7.
• T lineage, primary:
• CD3.
• T lineage, secondary:
• CD4, CD8, CD11b, CD16, CD57.

Lymphocyte subsets
• Normal adult ranges:
+
- total T cells (CD3 )
+
- CD4 T cells
+
- CD8 T cells
+
- total B cells (CD19 )
+
+
- NK cells (CD16 CD56 )
+
+
- activated T cells (CD3 CD25 )

0.69-2.54×109/L
0.41-1.59×109/L
0.19-1.14×109/L
0.09-0.66×109/L
0.09-0.56×109/L
0.1-0.4×109/L

Principles of testing
• Single-platform ﬂow cytometry is considered the gold standard.
• Fluorescence microscopy should not be used.
• Direct conjugation of the ﬂuorochrome to the antibody is preferred.
• Beads are used to calibrated absolute counts.

565

566

CHAPTER 20

Cellular investigations

• Results should be reported as absolute counts: percentages and ratios
are not helpful for the basic markers but may be useful for extended
panels (see next section).
• Robust EQA schemes exist for common markers.

Indications for testing
• Diagnosis and monitoring of immunodeﬁciency states.
• Monitoring immunotherapeutic agents (anti-T-cell antibodies, cytotoxic
drugs).

Interpretation
• Wide availability of commercial reagents with different ﬂuorochromes
allows many permutations and combinations, using multichannel ﬂow
cytometers.
• Some of the ﬂuorochromes are large molecules, and multiple staining
of markers on cells may give rise to steric hindrance and reduced
binding.
• Correct set-up of compensation for the ﬂow cytometer is essential.
This must be checked regularly and especially after servicing.
• Regular quality control checks should be carried out with commercial
ﬂuorochrome coupled beads.
• A basic panel for primary immunodeﬁciency work should include the
following.
• T cells: CD3, CD4, CD8.
• B cells: CD19 or CD20.
• NK cells: CD16 and CD56.
• activated cells: CD25, MHC class II.
• Additional markers may include the following.
• CD45RA, CD45RO, CD27 (naive and effector T cells):
- CD4+CD45RA+CD27+ = naive T cells
- CD4-CD45RA+CD27+ = naive T cells
- CD4-CD45RA+CD27- = effector T cells.
• CD27, sIgM, sIgD (naive, memory, and class-switch memory):
- CD27-sIgM+sIgD+ = naive B cells
- CD27+sIgM+sIgD+ = memory B cells
- CD27+sIgM-sIgD- = class-switch memory B cells.
• Tcr aB and Gd.
• Leucocyte adhesion and complement receptors (see above).
• MHC class I (bare lymphocyte syndrome).
• Lymphocyte numbers have a marked circadian rhythm. In serial
monitoring, samples must be taken at the same time of day.
• In a baby with suspected SCID, the presence of mainly activated
CD8+ T cells raises suspicion of materno-fetal engraftment, while the
presence of activated CD4+ T cells, in the presence of large numbers
of eosinophils, is suggestive of Omenn’s syndrome.
• T-cell receptor gene rearrangements will show an oligoclonal
response.
• Absence of CD8+ T cells is a feature of ZAP-70 kinase deﬁciency.
• Abnormalities of T- and B-cell populations are also seen in CVID, with
CD4+ T-cell lymphopenia, affecting particularly CD45RA+ T cells, and
absence of class switch memory B cells.

B-CELL FUNCTION IN VIVO ASSAYS

• After HSCT, high levels of activated T cells often indicate GvHD.
• Very low CD4+ T-cell counts are not a diagnostic feature of HIV
disease.
• Temporary reductions in the CD4+ T-cell count are seen with a
number of trivial viral infections, particularly in the acute phase.
• This is often accompanied by an elevation of the CD8+ T cells and
NK cells.
• Lymphocyte phenotyping must not be used as a surrogate for HIV
testing without consent.
• CD4:CD8 ratio is of little value. Risk of opportunist infections is
determined by absolute CD4 count.
• Basic panel of CD3, CD4, and CD8 is all that is required (with viral
load monitoring).
• Recovery of cell numbers may be seen with HAART.
• Persistent CD4+ T-cell lymphopenia has also been reported as a cause
of opportunistic infections in the absence of any evidence for infection
with either HIV-1 or HIV-2 (idiopathic CD4+ T-cell lymphopenia).
• Rare deﬁciency of the binding site for the anti-CD4 mAb OKT3 is
recognized, giving spuriously low CD4 counts. This variant CD4
appears functionally normal.
• Abnormal lymphocyte proﬁles are also seen in:
• lymphoma
• malignancy
• chronic fatigue syndromes
• protein-losing enteropathy
• overtraining syndrome.
• Generalized proportionate reductions in lymphocyte counts are seen
with long-term immunosuppressive therapy.
• CD4/CD8 double-negative Tcr γδ T cells are increased in ALPS (see
Chapter 1).

B-cell function: in vivo assays
Principles of testing
• In vivo antibody production is measured by detection of serum
antibody levels and rise in titre after deliberate test immunization.
• Antibody levels should be measured to exposure and immunization
antigens.
• Testing should include protein and polysaccharide antigens (see
Table 20.1).
• Subclass-speciﬁc responses can be measured to some antigens.
• Serotype-speciﬁc responses can be measured to pneumococcal
polysaccharides (not all serotypes are equally immunogenic).
• Isohaemagglutinins, in appropriate blood group patients allow
detection of IgM responses.
• In the USA, the bacteriophage ΦX174 is used as an immunogen. This
neoantigen permits detection of primary and secondary antibody
responses.

• Antibodies will normally be detected by EIA on serum, or by
complement-ﬁxation assays (viral antibodies).
• ELISPOT assays allow the detection of speciﬁc antibody-producing
B cells.
• EQA schemes exist for viral and bacterial antibodies.

Indications for testing
• Suspected antibody deﬁciency.

Interpretation
• Full infection and immunization history is required to evaluate
responses.
• Dynamic responses after immunization give a better view of B-cell
function.
• Target should be a rise into the normal/protective range with a
minimum of a fourfold rise in titre.
• Assays for bacterial antibodies are poor with CVs of 15-25%. Pre- and
post-immunization samples should be run on the same assay.
• Assays must be interpreted with caution.
• Only killed or subunit vaccines should be given to patients with
suspected immunodeﬁciency.
• Role of subclass- and serotype-speciﬁc assays is uncertain at present.
Multiplex assays may be valuable for rapid screening of responses to
multiple serotypes.
• Move to conjugated polysaccharide vaccines may lead to loss of pure
polysaccharides for test immunization.

T-CELL FUNCTION: IN VIVO ASSAYS

B-cell function: in vitro assays
Principles of testing
• In vitro B-cell function is usually tested by stimulation of puriﬁed
mononuclear cells by:
• pokeweed mitogen (PWM)
• anti-IgM + IL-2
• Staphylococcus strain A Cowan (SAC)
• Epstein-Barr virus (EBV).
• IgG, IgA, and IgM production can be measured at 7 days by sensitive
ELISA of the supernatant.
• Testing is time-consuming.

Indications for testing
• There are few clinical indications for this at present.
• Flow cytometric detection of class-switch memory B cells is quicker
and easier than using anti-IgM + IL-2 system to identify prognostically
important subgroups of common variable immunodeﬁciency
(Chapter 1).

Interpretation
• Interpretation depends on the type of assay used and the
establishment of appropriate ranges for age and sex.

T-cell function: in vivo assays
Principles of testing
• T-cell function in vivo is tested by delayed-type hypersensitivity.
• Antigens are pricked through the skin (Merieux Multitest CMI®) or
injected intradermally.
• Most useful antigens include PPD, Candida, mumps, tetanus, and
streptokinase/streptodornase, which are available (some with
difﬁculty) as single antigens, or are part of the battery in the Multitest.

Indications for testing
• Testing is of limited value except in the circumstance of chronic
mucocutaneous candidiasis, where there is often speciﬁc anergy to
Candida with reasonable responses to other antigens.

Interpretation
• There may be early reactions but these are due to mechanisms not
involving T cells.
• At 72-96 hours, in a positive reaction, there will be a cellular inﬁltrate
that is palpable, with overlying erythema.
• Reactivity to the panel is low in early childhood and increases with age.
• Poor responses are seen in:
• T-cell immune deﬁciencies (primary and secondary)
• combined immune deﬁciency

T-cell function: in vitro assays
Principles of testing
• In vitro T-cell function testing is carried out by inducing the T cells to
proliferate by exposure to either mitogens or antigens.
• Mononuclear cells are separated from neutrophils by density gradient
centrifugation (Ficoll®).
• Proliferation of the T cells is measured by the incorporation into DNA
of tritiated thymidine in replicating cells.
• Other methods used to study T-cell function in vitro include ﬂow
cytometric tests for the following.
• Measurement of calcium ﬂux.
• DNA replication (a non-isotopic alternative to the standard
proliferation assay).
• Changes in surface antigen expression in response to activation
(IL-2 receptor, CD25, transferrin receptor, CD71, CD69, and the
nuclear antigen Ki-67).
• Intracellular cytokines: cytokine production in culture can be
measured, but this is not done routinely and the ﬂow cytometric
determination of intracellular cytokine is likely to be of more value.
• There is little value in the MLR as a test of T-cell function, although it
forms a part of cross-matching bone marrow.
• ELISPOT assays can be used to measure cytokine production in
response to antigens and will also give a precursor frequency.

Indications for testing
• Suspected primary T-cell or combined immune deﬁciency.
• Functional assays are rarely required in secondary T-cell
immunodeﬁciency.
• Monitoring of the T-cell proliferative response after HSCT provides
a useful marker of returning function that will determine safe release
from laminar ﬂow.

Interpretation
• Results will be reported as counts per minute (cpm) for the
unstimulated and stimulated cells and as a stimulation index.
• For PHA-stimulated cells the uptake should be >5000cpm and the
increment over the unstimulated cells should be >4000cpm. The
stimulation index should be >10.
• For antigens such as Candida, the response is smaller and an increment
of 2000cpm and a stimulation index of 3.0 are satisfactory.

LYMPHOMA DIAGNOSIS

• The requesting clinician must also arrange a control sample from a
healthy volunteer, where possible of the same age/sex as the patient.
• This is necessary, as there are wide variations in individual
responses, even in healthy individuals, and there are variations with
age.
• Each laboratory should establish its own age- and sex-speciﬁc normal
ranges for each mitogen.
• The most useful stimuli are the following.
• Phytohaemagglutinin (PHA): a lectin (sugar-binding molecule)
derived from kidney beans. This binds to sugar residues on a
number of surface molecules, thus activating cells by several
pathways simultaneously, including via the CD3-Tcr complex.
• Concanavalin A (ConA): a lectin derived from jack beans. Its
effect is similar to that of PHA except that it depends on normal
monocyte accessory function.
• Mitogenic anti-CD3 monoclonal antibodies: soluble and
immobilized anti-CD3 cause speciﬁc stimulation of T cells via the
CD3-Tcr complex, mimicking antigen.
• Phorbol esters (phorbol myristate acetate, PMA): this molecule
activates protein kinase C directly in cells, bypassing the need for
membrane events. The addition of a calcium ionophore, which
raises the intracellular calcium by inserting unregulated calcium
channels in the membrane, increases the effect of PMA on PKC, as
it is a calcium-dependent enzyme.
• Interleukin-2: this has very little effect on its own but is synergistic
with anti-CD3. Restoration of proliferative responses to other
stimuli by the addition of IL-2 suggests a downstream defect leading
to reduced/absent IL-2 production.
• Antigens: many antigens can be used, but the most useful are
Candida, tetanus, PPD, and viral antigens (CMV, HSV, rubella), as
patients are likely to have been exposed or immunized. Responses
are lower, as the frequency of T cells with the correct Tcr will be
small.

Lymphoma diagnosis
Principles of testing
• Diagnosis of lymphoma follows principles similar to those for
leukaemia typing, except that the cells are in a solid organ.
• Single-cell suspensions produced by disaggregating the tissue can be
used.
• Most information is gained from looking at tissue sections.
• Staining is usually done with monoclonal antibodies followed by
anti-mouse antibody conjugated to a reagent for developing a
colour reaction (peroxidase, alkaline phosphatase-anti-alkaline
phosphatase, etc.).
• Most studies can now be carried out on parafﬁn sections.

571

572

CHAPTER 20

Cellular investigations

• Immunophenotyping will normally be undertaken in parallel with
morphological, virological, and enzymatic studies.
• The primary panel usually includes:
• CD45 (leucocyte common antigen)
• CD45RA (minority of T cells and B cells)
• CD3 (T cells)
• CD4 (T-helper cells plus macrophages and dendritic cells)
• CD8
• C3bR (follicular dendritic cells, B cells, macrophages)
• HLA-DR (B cells, activated T cells)
• surface immunoglobulins (heavy and light chains)
• Ki-67 (nuclear antigen expressed in proliferating cells).
• The secondary panel for T-cell antigens includes:
• CD2, CD5, CD7, and CD1, although the latter is also expressed on
dendritic cells and macrophages.
• The secondary panel for B-lineage antigens includes CD10, CD21,
CD22, CD23, CD24, CD79a, and CD5 (also expressed on T cells).
• Conﬁrmation of the presence of Reed-Sternberg cells can be obtained
by using CD30 and CD15.
• Histiocytes are reactive with CD68.
• LMP-1 is a surface marker of EBV+ cells and is expressed on Reed-
Sternberg cells.
• In situ hybridization can be used to detect oncogene expression and
viral genes.
• Initial and supplementary antibody panels will be used.
• Extracted material can be used as a source of DNA for molecular
studies of T-cell receptor and Ig heavy-chain gene rearrangements as
markers of clonality.
• EQA systems exist.

Indications for testing
• Any excised lymphoid tissue where lymphadenopathy is a feature
should be examined for evidence of lymphoma.

Interpretation
• In the differential diagnosis of an abnormal lymph node the question ‘Is
this a malignant process or a reactive process?’ must be answered.
• Lymphomas often express aberrant patterns of surface and cellular
antigens:
• κ:λ ratios > 10:1
• sIg negative, B-lineage antigen positive
• co-expression of B-lineage antigens and CD5, CD10, CD43, or CD6
• loss of an expected T-lineage antigen
• dual expression of CD4 and CD8 (outside thymus)
• expression of terminal deoxytransferase (TdT) or CD1a (outside
thymus).
• Lymphoid tumours need to be distinguished from other (metastatic)
malignancy:
• cells of lymphoid origin usually express CD45

NEUTROPHIL FUNCTION TESTING

•

•

•

•
•

• other markers are available to distinguish cells from other sources,
including carcinoembryonic antigen, cytokeratin, chromogranin,
desmin, and S-100.
Hodgkin’s disease is distinguished by the presence of characteristic
Reed-Sternberg cells:
• usually detectable by standard histology, although they may be sparse
• can be identiﬁed by their reaction with CD30 and CD15, without
reactivity with CD45 or T/B lineage antigens.
Evidence of clonality can now be obtained by studies of Ig and Tcr
gene rearrangements by molecular techniques:
• this can be carried out even on DNA extracted from parafﬁn
sections
• because of the use of PCR techniques to amplify the DNA of
interest, very small samples can be analysed.
Abnormal expression of oncogenes and tumour suppressor genes can
be detected by in situ hybridization. Oncogenes routinely screened for
include:
• Bcl-2
• cyclin D1
• p53
• Bcl-6
• CD99 (myc-2)
• c-myc.
Viral screens include EBV, CMV, HHV6, HHV8.
The classiﬁcation of lymphomas is constantly being revised in the light
of new ﬁndings. Readers are advised to consult an up-to-date detailed
text to understand the process.

Neutrophil function testing
Principles of testing
• First test is neutrophil count (serial counts required for cyclic
neutropenia—3 times weekly for 6 weeks).
• Screening test for defects of oxidative metabolism (CGD) is nitroblue
tetrazolium reduction test, in which a colourless intracellular dye
is reduced to an insoluble blue compound, formazan, when the
neutrophil’s oxidative machinery is activated.
• Usually done as a simple slide test.
• Can be done as a quantitative assay, with extraction of the
formazan and quantitation by colorimetry.
• Flow cytometry using dye reduction (dihydrorhodamine (DHR)) allows
more cells to be analysed more quickly.
• NBT and DHR tests should be done in parallel, as there are
examples of neutrophil deﬁciencies where one test is abnormal but
the other is not.
• Other tests of the oxidative machinery include chemiluminescence
(ampliﬁed by luminol) and the iodination test, which relates to
hydrogen peroxide production.

573

574

CHAPTER 20

Cellular investigations

• Phagocytosis can be measured by simply counting the number of latex
beads or yeasts ingested by neutrophils or, more accurately, by ﬂow
cytometry using labelled bacteria.
• Bacterial killing assays allow the whole process to be tested, including
opsonization, phagocytosis, and oxidative metabolism.
• Test organism is incubated with patient’s serum or control serum and
then each is incubated with either normal or patient’s neutrophils.
• At a ﬁxed time thereafter, the cells are lysed and the lysate plated
out to allow residual live bacteria to grow.
• Normally all bacteria will be killed within 30 minutes.
• Chemotaxis assays are usually carried out by measuring migration
under agarose or by the Boyden chamber method, in which cells
migrate into a microporous ﬁlter which is examined under a
microscope with a vernier gauge on the focusing ring, allowing the
distance travelled to the leading edge to be measured.
• Monocytes can be studied on ﬂow cytometers at the same time as
neutrophils.
• Speciﬁc defects include absence of G-IFN receptors, IL-12.
• No EQA schemes exist. Therefore laboratories must establish their
own normal ranges and set up normal controls in parallel with patient
samples for all assays.

Indications for testing
• Any patient with suspected neutrophil disorder:
• recurrent abscesses, especially if deep-seated (liver)
• extensive oral ulceration/gingivitis
• atypical granulomatous disease
• unusual bacterial or fungal infections—especially catalase-positive
organisms (aspergillus, staphylococcus).

Interpretation
• Slide NBT tests may miss some cases of chronic granulomatous
disease and, if there is a high degree of suspicion, it is essential to
perform a more sensitive ﬂow cytometric assay.
• With sensitive ﬂow cytometric assays, heterozygotes for CGD
mutations may have half the normal activity.
• Bacterial killing assays may be abnormal in healthy children under the
age of 2 years.
• Chemotaxis is an important part of the process and rare defects due
to the lack of anaphylotoxin receptors have been reported.
• Both methods for chemotaxis give wide ranges even for normal
individuals, so determining what is abnormal is often difﬁcult.
• Neutrophil function testing should always include testing for adhesion
molecule deﬁciency (see ‘Adhesion markers’, p.559) and for neutrophil
enzymes, especially myeloperoxidase (a common deﬁciency of
doubtful signiﬁcance), G6PD, and alkaline phosphatase (reduced in
speciﬁc granule deﬁciency).
• Neutrophil assays must be done with fresh samples.
• Any intercurrent infection will cause abnormal function.

NK-CELL FUNCTION

• Follow-up protein studies and genetic investigations are required
where defects of oxidative metabolism are identiﬁed in screening tests.

NK-cell function
Principles of testing
• Activity of MHC non-restricted killer cells (natural killer cells) can be
assessed in vitro.
• Erythroleukaemia cell line K562 is known to be susceptible to lysis by
NK cells.
• Assay is carried out by incubating mononuclear cells with labelled
K562 cells at varying effector target cell ratios and then identifying the
death of the targets.
• Conventional method is to surface label the targets with Cr51, and
then measure the release of the isotope into the medium on cell
death.
• Appropriate controls are required to identify spontaneous release
of the isotope and target cell death unrelated to effector cell
activity (should be less than 5%).
• Flow cytometric assays use a green ﬂuorescent membrane-bound
dye to label the targets.
• Cell death is identiﬁed by the uptake of propidium iodide, which
gives a red ﬂuorescence.
• Thus live and dead targets can be separated from the unlabelled
effector cells by their staining.
• The assays can be modiﬁed using different targets to look at antibodydependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) and lymphokineactivated killer (LAK) activity.
• No EQA exists. Laboratories must establish normal ranges and run
normal controls with each assay.
• The test depends on availability of high-quality K562 cells. Long-term
cell culture must be meticulous.

Indications for testing
• Indications are limited.
• NK-cell deﬁciency has been reported (rarely) causing severe infections
with herpesviruses.
• Routine screening of patients with simple cold sores is not justiﬁed.
• NK-cell function may be relevant in graft rejection and assessment of
rare NK-cell leukaemias.

Interpretation
• Flow cytometric assay is more sensitive to minor target-cell damage,
permeabilizing the cell to the red dye. Therefore oversensitivity is a
problem.
• Chromium-release assay depends on the complete disintegration of
the cell.

575

576

CHAPTER 20

Cellular investigations

• Clinical diagnostic value of the NK assay remains to be fully evaluated.
Routine evaluation of ADCC and LAK activity is not undertaken.
• Excessive NK-cell activity has been associated with an increased risk
of graft loss in mismatched bone marrow transplants (particularly host
NK-cell activity).
• Low/absent NK activity has been reported in rare patients with
recurrent infections with herpes family viruses.
• Very high activity may be found in NK-cell leukaemias.
• Number of NK cells identiﬁed by ﬂow cytometry does not necessarily
correlate with the activity.

NK granule release
Principles of testing
• CD107a (lysosomal-associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP1)) is
expressed on the surface of NK cells that have degranulated.
• K562 cells are used as a target for NK cells to stimulate degranulation,
as they do not express MHC Class I antigens.
• Expression of CD107a on NK cells (CD3+ CD56+) is detected by ﬂow
cytometry after incubation of separated PBMNC with K562 cells.
• PHA is also used as a non-speciﬁc activator of degranulation.

Indications for testing
• Suspected familial haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (FHLH).

Interpretation
• Patients with FHLH due to Munc 13-4 and Syntaxin 11 deﬁciency will
have absent degranulation.
• Patients with perforin deﬁciency will have normal granule release.
• A normal control is required with each run.
• Very few NK cells should express CD107a unstimulated; >7% should
express it when stimulated.
• Assay depends on ready access to high-quality K562 cells.

Perforin expression
Principles of testing
• Flow cytometric detection of intracellular perforin, using a
permeabilization technique on separated PBMNC.
• Perforin is expressed in the granules of NK cells, some CD8+ T cells,
CD56+ T cells, and δ T cells.

Indications for testing
• Suspected familial haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (FLH) (see
Chapter 1).

T-CELL RECEPTOR

Interpretation
• Only 30% of patients with FLH will have a perforin defect. Follow-up
degranulation assays should be carried out if perforin expression
is normal and there is a high degree of suspicion (see ‘NK granule
release’, p.576).
• XLPS should be excluded in males.

Toll-like receptors (TLRs)
Principles of testing
• Flow cytometric assay based on the shedding of CD62L (L-selectin) by
neutrophils when activated.
• All 10 TLRs identiﬁed signal via MyD88 and IRAK-4 (clinical
deﬁciencies of both are described (see Chapter 1)). Four TLRs signal
via UNC-93B (TLR3, TLR7, TLR8, TLR9).
• Activation of neutrophils via TLRs will lead to loss of CD62L.
• Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is the ligand for TLR4; CL097 (an
imidazoquinoline) is a ligand for TLR7/8. PMA is used as a positive
control (bypasses TLRs to activate neutrophils).

Indications for testing
• Suspected deﬁciency of IRAK-4, MyD88, or UNC-93B.

Interpretation
• IRAK-4- and MyD88-deﬁcient patients will shed CD62L normally with
PMA, but not with LPS or CL097.
• UNC-93B-deﬁcient patients will shed CD62L normally with PMA and
LPS but not with CL097.

TRECs
• Analysis of T-cell receptor excision circles (TRECs) is valuable in
assessing thymic output, e.g. post-HSCT, in HIV patients on HAART
(low levels may predict disease progression).
• As TRECs do not replicate during cell division, progressive dilution
occurs post-emigration.
• Assays are not yet widely available for routine use.
• TRECs can be detected on magnetic-bead-separated T-cell
subpopulations by quantitative PCR techniques.

T-cell receptor and immunoglobulin
heavy-chain gene rearrangements
• Testing is carried out by multiplex PCR ampliﬁcation followed by PAGE.
• Panels of Tcr VB-speciﬁc labelled monoclonal antibodies can be used
to carry out testing by ﬂow cytometry.

577

578

CHAPTER 20

Cellular investigations

• This enables monoclonal expansions in the T-cell repertoire
(lymphoma, response to chronic infection) and selective clonal loss
(e.g. Omenn’s syndrome, DiGeorge syndrome) to be identiﬁed.
• Spectra type of Tcr VB and IgH gene usage can be constructed to
demonstrate polyclonal, oligoclonal, and monoclonal gene usage, using
ﬂuorescent PCR products.
This type of testing is crucial in lymphoma diagnosis, and in the diagnosis
of oligoclonal states such as Omenn’s syndrome.

CHAPTER 21

Tissue typing

Introduction
Key elements
• Key elements for successful transplantation are:
• ability to correctly identify tissue types of recipients and donors
• prediction of graft rejection (host versus graft)
• in the case of a bone marrow transplant, prediction of graft-versushost disease (GvHD).
• Antigens of the MHC system are deﬁned and reviewed by the WHO
to ensure there is a common approach to nomenclature and typing.
• Ideal match is an identical twin: few individuals requiring
transplantation have such a donor.
• Most transplants are from matched unrelated donors (MUDs) or
parents/siblings with a close but not identical match.
• In the case of a parental donor, this will usually only be a haploidentical match (half-identical) unless there is consanguinity in the
family, in which case the match may be better.
• Not all transplantation is affected identically by HLA matching.
• For renal and bone marrow transplantation, the better the match,
the better the graft function and the fewer the complications.
• For liver transplantation, HLA matching is not beneﬁcial.
• For cardiac transplantation, HLA matching is impractical because of
time constraints and door limitations.
• Matching for living related donors is less critical than for cadaveric
transplants.
• If a poorly matched solid organ is transplanted, the recipient may
require considerable immunosuppressive therapy to prevent rejection,
increasing risks of secondary malignancies and opportunist infections.

Historical approach
• Requirement for a high-resolution match in BMT and HSCT has led to
the generation of highly speciﬁc techniques capable of identifying very
minor changes in histocompatibility antigens.
• Tissue typing used to be undertaken by two techniques.
• HLA class I antigens were identiﬁed (and in many cases deﬁned) by
serology, using sera derived from multiparous women who often
develop anti-HLA antibodies.
• As this technique does not identify all class II antigens, cellular tests
had to be used.

Current approach
Molecular biological techniques are now used.
• Where antigens have previously been deﬁned serologically, it is
now clear from molecular genotyping that some antigens classed as
completely distinct by serology are more closely related to each other
than some speciﬁcities thought, on serological grounds, to be part of a
closely related family (‘splits’ of an antigen).
• Nomenclature has been changed to reﬂect the differences.
• Molecular typing is critical in deciding whether a donor is a good
match for a given recipient, as two different HLA-B antigens, deﬁned

MATCHING PROCEDURES

• serologically, may differ by only one amino acid, and therefore
represent a better match than two splits of the same antigen which
may differ by ﬁve or more amino acids.
• Under the right circumstances even a one-amino-acid change is enough
to generate a detectable speciﬁc CTL response, while a ﬁve-aminoacid difference may lead to irretrievable graft rejection or GvHD.

Process
• In transplant matching there are two main steps:
• tissue types of recipient (and donor) must be established
• cross-match stage, in which the suitability of the proposed match
is tested.
• For renal transplantation, the donor will be tissue typed and blood
grouped (ABO and rhesus (Rh)) and the recipient screened at regular
intervals for the presence of anti-HLA antibodies.
• If there are potential living related donors, these will be tissue
typed and blood grouped and then the recipient’s sera will be
tested against donor cells for anti-donor antibodies.
• A good donor will be ABO compatible, with the best match of
HLA antigens, and the recipient will lack anti-donor antibodies (preformed antibodies are a cause of hyperacute rejection).
• If there is no suitable living related donor, the patient will be listed
to receive a cadaver organ, with their clinical and immunological
details stored on a central register.
• This allows best use of cadaver organs across the country, as
cadaver organs can be given to the best-matched recipients who
are likely to derive most beneﬁt.
• The cadaver organ will have been ABO/Rh and HLA typed and
recipients chosen on the best match if they have no pre-formed
antibodies against the identiﬁed HLA antigens.
• Immediately before transplant takes place, a fresh sample of the
patient’s serum will be cross-matched against donor lymphocytes to
check that no new antibodies have developed.
• Normally, to ensure that there are sufﬁcient donor lymphocytes
to cross-match (as this may have to be done several times against
different potential recipients), the spleen is removed to provide a
source of cells.
• Patients who have had previous grafts are often highly sensitized,
and have high levels of antibodies, which can cause difﬁculty in
identifying suitable donors.

Matching procedures: detecting
pre-formed circulating antibodies
• Cross-match allows detection of antibodies in the recipient that may
affect graft viability.
• It is used in the case of solid organs, where the patient’s serum is
tested against donor cells.

581

582

CHAPTER 21

Tissue typing

• Antibodies of interest are mainly IgG anti-HLA class I and anti-HLA
class II antibodies.
• IgM antibodies are often (but not always) considered to be
autoantibodies whicht may cause false-positive responses that are not
deemed signiﬁcant to the outcome of the transplant unless there has
been a recent sensitizing event.

Microlymphocytotoxicity
• Recipient’s serum is incubated with donor cells in the presence of
complement and the wells are scored for cytotoxicity.
• To control for autoantibodies, the donor’s cells are also tested.
• To distinguish anti-HLA class I and anti-HLA class II antibodies, T cells
and B cells are run separately since B cells express higher levels of
HLA class I antigens.
• Positive IgG anti-T-cell antibody is generally regarded as a
contraindication to transplantation because of risk of hyperacute
rejection and increased incidence of early vascular rejection.
• B-cell reactivity may occur in the absence of a positive T-cell match.
• IgM antibodies can be detected by performing the assay in the presence
of dithiothreitol or dithioerythritol to disrupt pentameric IgM.
• If a positive cross-match becomes negative in the presence of these
agents, an IgM antibody is likely.
• Performing tests at 37°C helps eliminate cold-reactive antibodies that
are often non-speciﬁc.

ELISA
• ELISA can be used to identify antibodies to HLA class I and II.
• Puriﬁed HLA class I or class II antigens are coated on to microtitre
wells and the patient’s serum is added.
• Bound antibody is identiﬁed using labelled anti-human IgG ± IgM
antibodies.
• Less sensitive and speciﬁc than ﬂow cytometry but more suitable for
testing large numbers of samples.

Flow cytometry
• Flow cytometry can be used to sensitively and speciﬁcally identify
antibodies to HLA class I and II.
• Donor lymphocytes are incubated with the patient serum’s and then
washed.
• They are then incubated with ﬂuoresceinated anti-human IgG or
IgM and anti-CD3 or anti-CD19 antibodies conjugated to a different
ﬂuorochrome.
• Analysed on ﬂow cytometer using dual-colour ﬂuorescence.

Magnetic bead technique
• Newer and quicker method using magnetic beads coated with speciﬁc
class I and class II antigens (Luminex® technology).
• Beads are incubated with recipient serum and then ﬂuoresceinated
anti-human IgG or IgM, separated with a magnet, and analysed in ﬂow
cytometer.

MIXED LYMPHOCYTE REACTION (MLR)

• Positive reactions may be diluted to assess titre of antibodies.
• Allows distinction between IgG and IgM antibodies.
• Identiﬁes both complement-ﬁxing and non-complement-ﬁxing
antibodies.
• Complement-ﬁxing antibodies are more likely to have a major
deleterious effect.
• Increased sensitivity picks up weaker antibodies, making positive
results harder to interpret.
• Excludes non-HLA antibodies, which may cause false-positive
lymphocytotoxic cross-matches but do not affect graft suitability.

Monitoring
• Patients on waiting lists for renal transplants will be screened
at intervals by microcytotoxicity and other antibody screening
techniques, which should be as sensitive as the cross-matching
technique against panels of pre-typed cells to identify the presence of
any anti-HLA antibodies.
• This speeds up the cross-matching, as cadaver grafts which lack the
antigens recognized can be selected.
• Donor-speciﬁc cross-matching has limited relevance to liver
transplants since they are relatively resistant to humoral rejection.
• Liver allograft may even protect a subsequent kidney transplant from
hyperacute rejection.

Mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR)
• MLR is an in vitro reaction to analyse recipient T-cell response to
foreign HLA and non-HLA molecules predicting the likelihood of
T-cell-mediated graft rejection, which may not be predicted from HLA
typing alone. This has been used in the assessment of potential bone
marrow donors but is now no longer in routine use.
• Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNC) from both donor and
recipient are cultured together.
• If donor and recipient have differing MHC and non-MHC alleles, the
mononuclear cells will proliferate.
• The proliferation assay takes 4-7 days to reach peak proliferation.
• Proliferation is usually identiﬁed by tritiated thymidine incorporation,
as for other T-cell proliferative assays (see Chapter 20).
• If donor and recipient lymphocytes are cultured together, both sets of
cells will proliferate (two-way MLR), confusing the results.
• Cells from the donor may be prevented from proliferating by exposing
them to mitomycin C or irradiation, so that only the recipient
lymphocytes will proliferate (one-way MLR).
• In bone marrow transplantation a one-way MLR is performed in both
directions, as the graft will also be immunologically active.
• Results are reported as a stimulation index or relative response.
• In detecting differences in class II antigens, MLR is much more sensitive
than serology. T cells may respond to allelic variants differing in a
single amino acid.

CHAPTER 21

Tissue typing

HTLp and CTLp frequency
• Variant on the MLR allowing identiﬁcation of number and functional
capacity of responding T cells. It is no longer in routine use.
• Limiting dilution step to identify the frequency of helper T lymphocytes
(HTLp) and cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLp) precursors.
• HTLp and CTLp assays may be combined.
• A stimulatory one-way MLR is run. Effector cells are removed and
assessed for cytotoxic activity (to assess CTLp frequency), and IL-2
activity in supernatants is analysed (to assess cytokine-generating HTLp
frequency).
• More sensitive than ordinary MLR, as the quantitation is more accurate
and allows different recipient-donor combinations to be compared.
• Increased frequency of precursors may increase likelihood of in vivo
reactivity, although clinical utility to predict graft-versus-host and hostversus-graft is unclear.

Tissue typing: serological methods
• Purpose of tissue typing is to identify the phenotype, i.e. expression
of HLA on cells. More than one method may be required to give a
complete picture.
• Now molecular testing identiﬁes the genotype, and the phenotype is
inferred.

HLA class I antigens
• For class I antigens (HLA-A, B, C), the standard technique is a
microcytotoxicity assay carried out in 20μL Terasaki plates.
• The patient’s mononuclear cells are plated out and typing sera with
known reactivity, derived from multiparous women, are added in the
presence of a source of fresh complement (normally rabbit).
• A panel of sera, up to 200, may be used to cover all the speciﬁcities.
• Each serum usually has more than one speciﬁcity and some of the
antibodies will be against more than one antigen (cross-reacting
antigen group), while others will be against a single monospeciﬁc
private antigen.
• A dye such as propidium iodide which only enters dead cells is added
and the plate is then viewed under ﬂuorescence, so that dead cells
show up as red.
• Other dye systems exist for visualizing the cells (eosin Y).
• Each well is scored for the amount of cell death.
• The pattern of killing is correlated with the known speciﬁcities of the
sera to identify the probable pattern.

HLA class II antigens
• Typing for class II antigens serologically has been difﬁcult, as the
antigens are only expressed on a minority of the mononuclear cell
fraction (B cells, monocytes, and activated T cells).

MOLECULAR HLA TYPING

• In order to carry out the tests, puriﬁed B cells are required, which
can be obtained either by nylon wool adherence (B cells adhere but T
cells do not) or by using a monoclonal antibody against a B-cell antigen
coupled to a magnetic bead, allowing the B cells to be puriﬁed with a
magnet.
• Obtaining adequate anti-HLA class II typing sera is also difﬁcult, as
these antibodies tend to be weaker than the HLA class I antibodies.
• Anti-HLA class I antibodies can be removed by absorption with
pooled human platelets, which express class I antigens only.
• As B cells express more class I than class II antigens, the need for
reagents free of anti-class I antibodies is obvious if false-positive
reactions are to be avoided.
• As a result, serological techniques have been of limited value in
deﬁning HLA class II polymorphisms.
• Molecular techniques have replaced both serological and cellular
techniques for class II typing and are also being used for more accurate
class I typing.

Molecular HLA typing
• Determination of the HLA type by genotyping has revolutionized
tissue typing and also revealed that the designation of speciﬁcities on
the basis of serology has been misleading.
• A variety of methods are in use; which to choose depends on the
speed with which an answer is required.

RFLP
• This technique uses the ability of certain endonucleases to cut DNA at
sites of ﬁxed sequences.
• By using several endonucleases speciﬁc for different sequences, DNA
will be reduced to fragments of different lengths.
• Differences in the lengths will be determined by the underlying genetic
structure.
• This technique, which is very slow (2-3 weeks), also requires
signiﬁcant amounts of DNA and is not sensitive enough to identify all
the alleles of class II antigens now identiﬁed by other techniques.
• Therefore it is of very limited value and is no longer in routine use.

PCR
• The development of the polymerase chain reaction, based on a
cyclical synthetic reaction catalysed by the Thermus aquaticus (Taq)
polymerase, has been to molecular biology what the monoclonal
antibody has been to immunology.
• Upstream and downstream primers are used to start off the reaction
by binding to the denatured ssDNA, which is then re-annealed and
allowed to complete synthesis.
• The new chains then act as the templates for further cycles.

585

586

CHAPTER 21

Tissue typing

• Many millions of copies of the desired piece of DNA can be produced
rapidly, in about 25-30 cycles.
• Probes can be directed at generic sequences (e.g. the ﬂanking regions
of a gene) or more speciﬁc probes can be derived.

Sequence-speciﬁc primer (SSP)
• This uses probes speciﬁc for allelic variants of HLA genes, where the
probes are speciﬁc for the allelic variant sequence and therefore only
amplify that sequence.
• This is known as sequence-speciﬁc primer PCR or SSP-PCR.
• It is a rapid technique (3 hours) but is of relatively low resolution.
• Higher resolution may be achieved at the cost of large numbers of
PCRs, expense, and complexity.
• It requires minimal amounts of DNA to start with.

Sequence-speciﬁc oligonucleotide probes (SSOP)
• The target DNA sequence is ampliﬁed by PCR and immobilized on a
ﬁlter.
• Labelled sequence-speciﬁc oligonucleotide (SSO) probes speciﬁc for
individual alleles are hybridized to the immobilized DNA.
• The oligonucleotide probes (18-24 nucleotides long) carry a
radioactive tracer, and the pattern of binding with the panel of probes
identiﬁes the sequences present and hence the genotype.
• The technique is relatively slow and also requires a large number of
probes to cover all the possible allelic variants (e.g. 22 probes are
required for the DR52 family (DR3, DR5, and DR6) alone).
• If it is a previously unrecognized allele, there will be no reaction, as no
probe will be available.
• Reverse SSOP can be performed by hybridizing target biotinylated
DNA with immobilized oligonucleotide probes.
• This technique is faster and is more suitable for routine diagnostic use.

Sequence-based typing
•
•
•
•
•

The nucleotide sequence of the HLA gene DNA is identiﬁed directly.
RNA is used as the original template to avoid amplifying pseudogenes.
DNA is made initially by reverse transcription.
This technique is fast (16-24 hours) and very accurate.
It will identify previously unknown alleles and has revealed a degree
of heterogeneity within the HLA genes that had not previously been
recognized.

Other techniques
• Reference-strand-mediated conformation analysis (RSCA) is a
conformational method that offers high resolution.
• The HLA type is assigned on the basis of accurate measurement of
conformation-dependent DNA mobility in gel electrophoresis.
• This allows discrimination of HLA alleles that differ by one
nucleotide.

HLA TESTING AS A DISEASE MARKER

• Variable N-terminal repeats analysis (VNTR) looks for polymorphisms
in the non-coding repeated DNA and can be used for detecting and
monitoring microchimerism post-transplant.
• Fluorescently labelled PCR primers amplifying short tandem repeat
loci are employed to obtain a ‘VNTR proﬁle’ for patient and donor
to assess the chimeric status of the patient.

KIR typing
• Increasing recognition of the importance of the NK cell receptors in
transplantation ( as well as autoimmunity and response to infection)
has led to interest in typing for these using molecular techniques.
• The KIR receptor family (killer inhibitory receptor) comprises 15 genes
and two pseudogenes. They recognize a limited spectrum of HLA
Class I molecules.
• The CD94/NKG2 family comprises four genes plus NKG2D which
recognize unconventional HLA Class i-like molecules.

HLA testing as a disease marker
• Many diseases are associated with HLA antigens, the best known being
the association of ankylosing spondylitis (AS) with HLA-B27.
• Requests are often submitted for tissue typing to identify this particular
antigen.
• It is not a diagnostic test, as HLA-B27 is a relatively common antigen
(8% of Caucasians) and not every positive patient develops the disease.
• 90% of patients with AS will be HLA-B27+, but 10% will have other
antigens.
• The relative risk of developing AS is 100 times greater in HLA-B27+
individuals compared with HLA-B27- individuals.
• It is most useful as a marker of probable exclusion of AS.
• In rheumatoid arthritis, the presence of DR4 (particularly DRB1*0401
and DRB1*0404 alleles) is associated with a greater risk of developing
erosions and extra-articular disease and a worse prognosis.
• Therefore typing may provide useful prognostic information which may
alter the approach to using disease-modifying drugs (e.g. anti-TNFA
therapeutics).
• In the absence of full tissue-typing facilities, HLA-B27 can be detected
by a more economical simple ﬂow cytometric test, although this is less
accurate.

587

588

CHAPTER 21

Tissue typing

Human anti-animal antibodies
• Circulating anti-animal antibodies are often an unrecognized and
unsuspected cause of interference in immunological assays (antibovidae).
• These must be distinguished from heterophile antibodies that have a
broader reactivity.
• Circulating anti-animal antibodies can arise from iatrogenic (diagnostic
or pharmaceutical agents) and non-iatrogenic (including animal
husbandry and pets) causes.
• Immunoassays may give false-positive or false-negative results and
should be considered where results do not match the clinical picture,
particularly if the patient has been exposed to animal-derived agents.
• Interference may be overcome by blocking agents or assay redesign
(e.g. use of chimeric antibodies).

Anti-mouse antibody
• These are the most common human anti-animal antibodies.
• The main reason is the increased use of murine monoclonal antibodies.
• OKT3, an anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody used as an
immunosuppressant in transplantation, has been associated with the
development of anti-mouse antibodies.
• They can interfere with its therapeutic effects when used subsequently
and, therefore monitoring of the development of antibodies is useful
clinically.

Anti-rabbit antibody
• Rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) may be used as an
immunosuppressant, and development of anti-rabbit antibodies has
been associated with decreased therapeutic efﬁcacy.
• False-positive immunoassays have been associated with unnecessary
invasive diagnostic procedures.

Anti-chimera antibodies
• Antibodies to recombinant humanized fusion proteins and chimeric
proteins, which interfere with function, have been described.

USEFUL WEBSITES

Chimerism studies
• Chimerism studies are valuable after HSCT. Mixed chimerism of
different lineages is common.
• Magnetic beads coupled to speciﬁc antibodies can be used to separate
key haematopoeitic cells for analysis with high purity.
• Where the donor is of the opposite sex, probes for X and Y
chromosome speciﬁc genes can be used.
• Otherwise donor and recipient polymorphisms in short tandem
repeats (STR) are used (see above).
• After HSCT for CGD, the proﬁle of the neutrophil oxidative burst by
ﬂow cytometer gives an accurate measure of donor neutrophils.

CHAPTER 22

Quality and Managerial Issues

Introduction
Clinical and laboratory services do not operate in isolation but are integrated into the clinical and managerial framework of a hospital, and in
the UK into a nationwide network (the NHS). This provides a constraint
in both managerial and ﬁnancial terms and also provides a legal framework in which services are delivered. It is essential that no matter where
the patient is treated the right diagnosis is reached and the appropriate
treatment is given. NHS service providers in the UK are now subject to
rigorous central direction by the Department of Health and inspection
by the quasi-autonomous Care Quality Commission (CQC), previously
known as the Healthcare Commission and before that the Commission
for Healthcare Improvement (CHI) (see http://www.cqc.org.uk/). For mainstream therapeutics and procedures, the National Institute for Health and
Clinical Excellence (NICE) determines whether therapies (drugs, procedures) should be available on the NHS, supposedly to eliminate postcode
prescribing (see http://www.nice.org.uk/ ).
With devolution the healthcare systems in Wales, Scotland and
Northern Ireland have now diverged substantially from the model in
operation in England, despite the anachronistic term of a ‘National’ Health
Service. This has become more marked with current (2012) changes introduced by the Coalition Government.
Scotland has retained a system of health boards, which manage all
services including hospitals and primary care. There is no system where
money follows patients. This is less bureaucratic. There has been divergence in service provision, with some services not available in Scotland,
and there are different approvals of drugs so that a new drug may be available in England but not in Scotland and vice versa.

Structure of the NHS and the NHS plan
Department of Health
• In 2002 the NHS commenced one of the biggest changes in structure
since its creation in 1948. The NHS plan was published in July 2000 and
outlined a 10-year plan of investment in NHS.
• The Department of Health (DoH) is responsible for leading the NHS
on social care as well as improving standards of public health.
• The Secretary of State for Health currently works with ﬁve ministers
for health and the Permanent Secretary of the DoH.
• The NHS has a chief executive, accountable to the DoH and to
Parliament.
• The Secretary of State for Health is accountable to Parliament for the
functioning of the NHS.

STRUCTURE OF THE NHS AND THE NHS PLAN

• The role of the DoH is to focus on providing strategic leadership for
the NHS. Examples include:
• setting overall direction
• ensuring national standards are set
• securing resources.
• It also interferes by attempting to micromanage services directly!
• In 2012, a new Health and Social Care Bill was passed in England. This
bill:
• will allow GP-led commissioning
• will enshrine a right to a level playing ﬁeld (which means that any
qualiﬁed provider can bid to run services, including private sector,
charities, etc.)
• will claim to provide a greater voice for patients (very unlikely, as
patients’ wishes are always ignored!)
• will remove the NHS from the direct control of the Secretary of
State (so politicians can’t be blamed when it all goes wrong!)
• will essentially privatize the NHS by the back door.

Delegated responsibilities
Previous DoH responsibilities have been now devolved to other organizations, including the following.
• Overall regulation and inspection of the NHS is now the responsibility
of the Care Quality Commission (CQC) (previously Healthcare
Commission and Commission for Healthcare Audit and Inspection
(CHAI)!!).
• Regional planning and modernization—devolved to the strategic health
authorities.
• Evaluation of therapies—devolved to NICE.
• National Patient Safety Agency (NPSA, Special Health Authority):
responsible for identifying and learning from risks to patients.
• NHS Litigation Authority (NHSLA, Special Health Authority)—
responsible for all litigation against the NHS.
• National Clinical Assessment Authority (NCAA)—responsible for
dealing with poorly performing doctors.

Strategic health authorities (SHAs)
Below the Secretary of State for Health there were 28 strategic health
authorities (replacing the regional health authorities) who managed the
NHS locally. Their roles included the following.
• Coherency and developing strategies to improve the local health
service.
• Ensuring high-quality performance of local health service.
• Building capacity.
• Making sure national priorities are integrated into local health plans.
• Implementation of modernization programmes.
In England these are in the process of being abolished and their functions
devolved to GP Commissioning Groups, led by Senates. However, in the
short term a smaller number of SHAs still operate and have some delegated responsibilities.

593

594

CHAPTER 22

Quality and Managerial Issues

Primary care trusts (PCTs)
• PCTs received 75% of NHS budget.
• They were supposed to be directly managed by GPs, but in practice
GPs often had little input into the decision-making process.
• They were responsible for:
• planning and securing services for the local population’s needs
• improving the health of local population
• integrating health and local care socially by working with local
authorities.
• They were required to spend 10% of their budgets on commissioning
services from the independent sector, via independent treatment
centres. This has proved highly destabilizing to NHS services: with
wards being closed and staff laid off.
• As well as commissioning services, they also acted as providers of
services, which many viewed as a conﬂict of interest
• As part of the health service reforms (2012), PCTs have been
abolished. Their provider functions have been transferred to other
provider units (often foundation trusts) and their commissioning role
has been transferred to GP-led commissioning groups.
• Senior staff have been laid off, with loss of key expertise. Some have
been re-engaged by the GP commissioning groups.

GP commissioning groups
• These have been established (in shadow in 2011-2012) to take on the
role of commissioning services from providers.
• They are led by a ‘senate’ of GPs.
• They are supposed to have consultant input from secondary care (but
are ﬁnding it difﬁcult to recruit volunteers)
• Although they were originally supposed to take on responsibility for
approximately 75% of the NHS budget, it is becoming clear that their
freedom of action and ﬁnancial responsibility is gradually being pared
down by the NHS Executive, which is concerned about the serious
effect of commissioning errors.
• Private organizations have become involved in some of these groups.

Specialist commissioning
• In England, clinical immunology and allergy are separately
commissioned by regional specialist commissioning teams.
• In 2013, regional commissioning will be replaced by central specialized
commissioning.
• A national advisory process has been set in place for 2012-2013.
• Services for SCID and other rare diseases or low-volume expensive
procedures (e.g. lung transplantation) are already commissioned
nationally, with only one or two sites in England. For SCID, these sites
(Great Ormond Street Hospital and Great North Childrens’ Hospital,
Newcastle) also provide services for Scotland, Wales and Ireland.

STRUCTURE OF THE NHS AND THE NHS PLAN

NHS trusts
• NHS trusts continue to run some hospitals, usually where there have
been major ﬁnancial issues affecting stability.
• They must develop working relationships with the PCT and are
accountable to the SHA rather than directly to the DoH.
• Their budget is derived predominantly from contracts with PCTs.
• Trusts also receive funding from medical schools to undertake medical
student training—this replaces the old SIFT (service increment for
teaching) arrangements, which have now been dismantled.
• The Chief Executive is now legally responsible for activities within the
trust. He/she can be dismissed by the trust board.

Foundation trusts
• Established in April 2004, foundation trusts are free-standing
organizations with greater freedom within the NHS, including the
freedom to borrow money in commercial markets.
• They now comprise the majority of NHS hospitals in England.
• They are considered as separate non-proﬁt making organizations.
• They are owned by their members who are local people, employees,
and other key stakeholders.
• A board of governors must be elected by members of the foundation
trust, including local people, patients, and employees.
• The board of governors works with the management board to ensure
that the foundation trust acts in a way that is consistent with its
objectives.
• The Secretary of State for Health does not have power to direct NHS
foundation trusts or appoint board members.
• They are accountable to an independent regulator (Monitor), who
is responsible for approving their application for foundation status
and who may remove that status if they do not manage their affairs
satisfactorily.
• They are accountable externally though inspection by the Care Quality
Commission.
• Income is derived through legally enforceable contracts with PCTs.
However, in 2012 at number of trusts required ﬁnancial bail-outs from
the DoH.

Franchise hospitals
• One hospital in England with long-standing problems has now been
handed over in its entirety to the private sector to be run as an NHS
franchise.
• It is unclear whether this is a model that will be rolled out more
widely.

595

596

CHAPTER 22

Quality and Managerial Issues

Opted-out services
• Current legislation in England allows services to opt out of direct
NHS control, while continuing to provide contractual services to NHS
patients.
• There are a number of ﬁnancial models for this.
• So far this has mainly involved therapy services in the community, but
in the future could include clinical services in secondary and tertiary
care.
• This could include the development of doctors’ chambers.

Clinical Pathology Accreditation (CPA)
• CPA is an organization that provides a means to:
• accredit clinical pathology services
• accredit external quality assessment schemes (EQA).
• Laboratories need to provide documentary evidence to meet an
extensive set of standards covering personnel, premises, equipment,
and pre- and post-analytical phases of the sample.
• New standards were introduced in April 2004. Standards are reviewed
by a standards advisory group.
• CPA has now been formally absorbed into the UK Accreditation
Service (UKAS)—the only internationally recognized accrediting body
in the UK.
• The original CPA structure of shareholding ownership by the
professional bodies has been wound up.
• For details see http://www.cpa-uk.co.uk/

Process
• The DoH has decreed that enrolment with the CPA is now mandatory
for all NHS laboratories.
• Once a laboratory applies for enrolment, inspection will automatically
follow.
• Only 75% of NHS laboratories are currently enrolled!
• The laboratory initially applies for accreditation by submitting an
application form, which includes the repertoire and a quality manual
that gives details of how the laboratory meets the standards and
describes its managerial structure.
• Once the application and quality manual have been reviewed by
the CPA ofﬁcers, assessors are appointed and a date for inspection
arranged.
• The CPA will usually send two inspectors, one clinician or scientist and
one senior biomedical scientist (BMS).
• Where a laboratory has a small repertoire a single inspector may
be used.

CLINICAL PATHOLOGY ACCREDITATION (CPA)

• Failures to meet the standards will be identiﬁed by assessors and
signed off at the time by the assessors and the applicant laboratory in
one of three categories:
• critical non-compliances, representing system failure and an unsafe
laboratory
• non-critical non-compliances which do not affect the safety of the
service
• observations.
• Paid assessors, with expertise in audit and quality systems
management, are now employed by the CPA to carry out the
horizontal and vertical audits.
• The assessors’ report is then reviewed by CPA ofﬁcers and passed to
the relevant member of the Professional Advisory Committee (PAC).
• The PAC is a single advisory committee with 21 members.
• It is responsible to the board of CPA for the implementation of all
matters relating to the laboratory accreditation section of CPA.
• Immunology is represented by a consultant and a BMS, who review
all reports before they are issued and have the power to override
and alter reports from assessors.
• The ﬁnal report is issued to the laboratory some 6-8 weeks later.
• This may be as follows.
• Full accreditation without conditions.
• Conditional approval for a ﬁxed period of time (usually up to a
year) subject to speciﬁed conditions that must be met within that
period. Once the conditions have been met, full accreditation will
be granted;
• Referral (failure), where the laboratory has critical non-compliances
such that it is unsafe. Decisions to refer laboratories are conﬁrmed
by the CPA council, to whom the applicant may appeal.
• Extended conditional approval is granted at the discretion of PAC
where a laboratory has conditions (such as rebuilding) that cannot
be met within a short time frame, but where the service is not
unsafe.
• Re-inspection currently takes place every 4 years.
• An interim inspection takes place every 2 years to review the quality
management system. This is undertaken by the paid assessors and does
not include peer review.
• Copies of the report are sent to the chief executive.
• Compliance with CPA standards is a requirement for trusts applying
for inspection under the Clinical Negligence Scheme for Trusts
(CNST) and is also required by the NHSLA.
• UKAS is the sole national accreditation body recognized by
government to assess, against internationally agreed standards,
organizations that provide certiﬁcation, testing, inspection, and
calibration services.

597

598

CHAPTER 22

Quality and Managerial Issues

Medicines and Healthcare Products
Regulatory Authority (MHRA)
• MHRA is responsible for licensing drugs and medical devices, and
products made by genetic engineering for clinical use. It also regulates
blood transfusion services (with inspections of both production
facilities and blood banks that are separate from the CPA).
• Licensing drugs is now regulated by Directives of the European Union.
See http://www.mhra.gov.uk/Aboutus/index.htm for more information.

Quality management system (QMS)
• QMS deﬁnes the process by which a laboratory ensures that all
aspects of its function achieve the highest possible quality.
• QMS requires documentation of all functions undertaken, both to
meet statutory requirements (COSHH) and to provide the framework
for staff to function effectively.
• Effective QMS is required to meet CPA standards.
• QMS must include robust document control, so that only current
versions of policies are available to staff.

Quality manual
• The quality manual deﬁnes how the laboratory meets each standard
for CPA.
• It includes the management structure and operational procedures for
the laboratory.
• It will cross-reference trust policies on health and safety, personnel
(training, induction), visitors, standing ﬁnancial instructions, IT, etc.

Laboratory handbook
• The laboratory handbook provides essential information on services
to users, including repertoire, sample requirements, normal ranges,
on-call services, and contact details.
• The handbook must be accessible to all users including primary care.
Internet and hard copy may be available.

Annual management review
• CPA requires laboratories to undertake an annual management review
by standards. This must be submitted each year to the CPA at renewal
of registration.

QUALITY CONTROL (INTERNAL)

Concepts of quality assurance in the
laboratory
• The primary goal of all clinical diagnostic laboratories is to generate
accurate and reproducible laboratory test results.
• All activities performed to monitor the quality of laboratory testing are
referred to as quality control (QC), which should be both internal and
external.
• Quality assurance (QA) is a broader term encompassing not only
quality control but also every stage from venesection to correct
delivery of the ﬁnal report.
• It includes physician ordering practices, maintenance of incubators and
glassware, clarity of reports, and appropriateness of testing methods.
• The purpose of QA is to ensure that the right test is carried out
on the right sample, and that the correct result is delivered to the
requesting clinician with the appropriate interpretation.

Deﬁnitions
• Sensitivity Incidence of positive results obtained when the test is used
for patients known to have the disease or condition
= (no. of true +ves/sum of true +ives and false -ves) × 100.
• Speciﬁcity Ability of a test to indicate a negative result in the absence
of disease
= (no. of true -ves/sum of true -ves and false +ves) × 100.
• Precision Closeness of replicate analyses.
• Accuracy Closeness to true value.
• Coefﬁcient of variation (CV) is deﬁned as the standard deviation
expressed as a percentage of the mean.

Quality control (internal)
Internal quality control consists of those procedures used by laboratory
staff for the continual assessment of laboratory work in order to decide if
the results are reliable. The main objectives are to ensure day-to-day consistency of measurements and to quantify random variation.

Internal QC samples
• To ensure that the test is carried out correctly it is essential practice
that internal QC samples are included in each run.
• Control sera must:
• be stable
• be stored for long periods without loss of activity
• be similar in composition to patient’s sera and treated in the same way
• be standardized against international (WHO) reference materials
where available
• test negative for HIV and HBV.

599

600

CHAPTER 22

Quality and Managerial Issues

• Depending on the assay, ideally more than one control should be used:
• they should be high, low, and at the cut-off level of the assay
• for automated analysers that include an automatic further dilution
step, a control should be included at a level that requires dilution.
• All values for the internal QC sample must be recorded, which
will allow running plots to be produced that give a warning of
deterioration in assay performance or running bias.

Recording internal QC data
There are a number of ways in which these can be plotted.
• The Shewhart chart plots the value of the internal control in absolute
values against time, with one and two standard deviations (SDs) and
the mean marked out.
• The values should be arrayed equally either side of the mean.
• Usually, action will be taken if more than four points are on the
same side of the mean or if two sequential points are beyond 2
SDs, although this should also result in run rejection (Westgard
rules).
• The Youden chart has a high and a low standard and the plot is the
same as for the Shewhart plot but in two dimensions. One value is
plotted with its mean horizontal and the other with its mean vertical.
Each point represents the value for the high sample plotted against the
value for the low sample.
• The points should be randomly arrayed around the intersection of
the means.
• The Cusum chart plots the difference of the day’s result from the
calculated mean value (with sign included). This plot will reveal
whether the mean has been set correctly and will also reveal changes
in accuracy.

Standard operating procedure
• The standard operating procedure (SOP) is a detailed recipe by which
tests are carried out. The SOP must identify:
• the name and purpose of the test and all the reagents used
• a detailed method that someone with normal laboratory
competence should be able to follow successfully
• hazards of the reagents, as required by COSHH regulations
• how and by whom the test results will be reported
• normal ranges
• which internal control samples should be used
• run rejection criteria
• author of the document
• sources of information (normal ranges) and references
• revision date for the document (normally annually).
• SOPs are controlled documents and all copies must be numbered.
• Old SOPs must be archived for medico-legal reasons.

QUALITY CONTROL (INTERNAL)

Evaluation of reagents
Another important facet of internal quality control is the evaluation of
reagents. This applies particularly to any ﬂuorescence reagents.
• The conjugated anti-human immunoglobulin reagents used in direct
and indirect immunoﬂuorescence need to be titrated to determine the
optimum (and most economical) working dilution.
• This is done by a chequerboard titration, where serial dilutions of
the conjugate are titrated against serial dilutions of a serum of known
speciﬁcity and titre.
• Reagents for use of the ﬂow cytometer should also be titrated against
increasing cell numbers.
• Process should be carried out each time a new batch is purchased.

Evaluation of new tests
• If a new test or methodology is considered for use in the laboratory,
features to consider include:
• cost
• ease of operation
• utilization of exiting resources
• accuracy, precision, sensitivity, and speciﬁcity
• comparison with gold-standard test
• evidence of clinical utility.
• An analyte should be repeatedly assayed on at least 20 runs to
determine the mean value and SD.
• The coefﬁcient of variation (CV) is more useful than the SD as several
QC samples at different levels in the result span may be used and the
assay variability will change.
• Comparison should be made with established or reference method.
• New test evaluations require the parallel testing of large numbers of
samples.
• End users must be warned of this change.
• Acceptable assay CVs will also vary depending on the nature of the
assay. Between-run CVs are 4-6% for nephelometry assays, whereas
they are 10-20% for ELISA.
• Accurate reference ranges are of prime importance in laboratory
practice.
• This should involve sampling the appropriate population of normal
individuals.
• The larger the group the more reliable this should be. A minimum
sample of 100 is required. The reference interval is set by including 2
SDs each side of the mean.

CHAPTER 22

Quality and Managerial Issues

Quality control (external) 1: EQA
schemes
• External quality control is an essential tool for ensuring that the
laboratory is performing satisfactorily and obtaining the same answers
as other laboratories.
• Satisfactory participation in external QC is a mandatory standard for
CPA accreditation.
• CPA accredits EQA schemes in the same way as it accredits
laboratories.
• Responsibility for EQA matters at CPA is assumed by the Professional
Advisory Committee (PAC) with three lead EQA members.
• EQA schemes fall under the remit of NEQAS. See http://www.ukneqas.
org.uk/

Process of EQA
• The essential element is the distribution of unknown samples at
regular intervals.
• Obtaining appropriate samples can be difﬁcult and in some cases
samples must be modiﬁed in order to be stable and reproducible (e.g.
cellular samples for ﬂow cytometric analysis).
• It is important that the samples are treated in the same way as normal
patient samples for the results to be meaningful.
• Once the returned results have been analysed, participants are sent a
summary showing their performance and how it compares with that of
other laboratories.
• This will often be broken down by method used, which allows
laboratories to see whether a method is performing particularly
well or badly.

Quantitative schemes
For quantitative analytes such as speciﬁc proteins, the method used is the
ABC of EQA where each analyte is given an A, B, or C score. Scores are
derived from specimen % bias, calculated as:
specimen % bias = (result - target)/target × 100.
Each of the three scores is calculated over a rolling time window of six
distributions.
Score A: accuracy This tells you how good your overall performance is. It
has been transformed to make it comparable across analytes. The median
is set at 100. It is calculated as follows.
• Specimen % bias is transformed by a ‘degree of difﬁculty’ factor, to get
specimen transformed bias (positive or negative).
• Modulus of this is taken to give specimen accuracy index (no sign).
• A score is calculated as the trimmed mean of specimen accuracy
indices in the rolling time window.
• Degree of difﬁculty is derived from examination of CVs between
laboratories in relation to target values and concentration-dependent
factors, normalized to a median A score of 100.

QUALITY CONTROL (EXTERNAL) 1: EQA SCHEMES

Score B: bias This tells you how far away from the target on average you
are. It is calculated as follows.
• Trimmed mean of all individual specimen % biases (including sign) in
rolling time window.
Score C: consistency of bias This tells you if you have the same bias pattern
on average. It is calculated as follows.
• Standard deviation of B score data, with allowances for trimming.
Older scoring schemes (gradually being replaced) These rely on variance
index scoring.
• For each sample there will be a designated value (DV).
• For quantitative analytes (i.e. protein chemistries), this is usually the
trimmed mean (i.e. the mean recalculated with outliers excluded).
• For qualitative analytes (e.g. ENAs) the designated value is determined
by the consensus of a small group of specialist reference laboratories.
• Performance is assessed by calculating the variance index (VI) from the
difference of the obtained value from the designated value corrected
by the chosen coefﬁcient of variance (CCV), a scaling factor dependent
on the type of assay being used, according to the formula:
VI = (xDV)/DV × 1000/CCV.
• For the variance index, the sign is ignored, but for the bias index the
sign is kept.
• The variance (VIS) and bias index (BIS) scores are calculated as VIS
(or BIS) = VI where VI <400. If VI >400, the maximum score of 400 is
applied.
• For many analytes, these are plotted graphically as running
performance scores by using the mean running VIS (MRVIS) or mean
running BIS (MRBIS), which are calculated by taking the mean of the
last 10 VISs or BISs.

Qualitative schemes
• For qualitative reporting, overall performance is judged by scoring
one point for each misclassiﬁcation compared with a designated value
(misclassiﬁcation score, MIS).
• The running performance is looked at by adding the scores of the
preceding 10 circulations to give the overall misclassiﬁcation score
(OMIS), which will have a maximum that is dependent on the
maximum number of answers that can be given wrongly. Perfect
performance gives a score of zero.

Weaknesses of EQA
• The problem about this type of EQA scheme is in the determination of
the ‘right’ answer.
• If, in a quantitative scheme, 90% of the laboratories use a method that
gives the ‘wrong’ answer and 10% use a method that gives a different
but correct answer, then the apparent performance of the 10% will
appear poor as the mean and SD will be determined largely by the
majority.

603

604

CHAPTER 22

Quality and Managerial Issues

• This is difﬁcult to address, although the DoH sponsors methodological
evaluations that are published as ‘Blue Book’ reports.
• Interpretation of immunoﬂuoresence can be particularly subjective, so
many laboratories are also members of regional QA schemes. Sera are
regularly distributed and participants meet and discuss the results and
problems.

Poor performance
• The National External Quality Assurance Scheme (NEQAS) will only
intervene if performance is persistently poor over a long period, and
according to pre-determined standards will report failing laboratories
to the chairman of the relevant National Quality Assurance Panel
(NQAAP)—see http://www.ukneqas.org.uk/content/PageServer.asp?S=
551418&C=1252&Type=G&ID=68
• The chairman of NAQAAP will then write to the head of the
laboratory pointing out the problem and asking what steps are being
taken to remedy the problem, as well as offering help (usually a visit
from a panel member).
• Lack of a response or an inappropriate response to this letter will lead
to a report direct to the CPA so that the laboratory’s accreditation
status can be reviewed.

Quality control (external) 2:
benchmarking and CE marking
Benchmarking
• Benchmarking is another method by which laboratories can
demonstrate the quality and cost-effectiveness of their service.
• It is a process of measuring products, services, and practices against
leaders in a ﬁeld, allowing the identiﬁcation of best practices that will
lead to improved performance.
• In the UK the Clinical Benchmarking scheme for pathology (see http://
www.keele.ac.uk/pharmacy/general/npbs/) has been running for many
years. The report analyses 10 areas of laboratory performance.
• Weaknesses include (for immunology) lack of comparability between
laboratories (repertoires, stafﬁng, etc.).
• The College of American Pathologists offers a Q-Probes scheme.
• However, benchmarking does not necessarily provide the ‘right’
answer.
• The most productive laboratory may not provide the best quality.

CE marking
• In 2003 a third European Medical Device Directive was introduced
stating that all diagnostic products must carry the CE mark (Kite mark)
following registration with the MHRA in the UK.
• This requires submission of data about the product (and a large fee!!).
• The CE mark can also be seen on electrical toys and goods.

CLINICAL STANDARDS AND AUDIT

• The cost of complying with these laws has led to the withdrawal of
some products that were no longer commercially viable following the
additional expense of registration.
• This law may have a signiﬁcant impact upon immunology where
conventionally many tests have been developed in-house.
• Provided that tests are not commercially marketed, an exemption has
been obtained for in-house NHS assays.
• All laboratories offering a commercial testing service or making kits for
commercial resale had to comply with these rules by December 2005.

Clinical standards and audit
Clinical work has been less amenable to such detailed quality assessment
However, several organizations now produce guidelines of ‘best practice’
against which the audit cycle can be carried out.

National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE)
• NICE is an independent organization responsible for providing national
guidance on the promotion of good health and the prevention and
treatment of ill health (see http://www.nice.org.uk/ ).
• On 1 April 2005 NICE joined with the Health Development Agency to
become the new National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence
(also known as NICE).
• Currently, NICE produces three kinds of guidance.
• Technology appraisals—guidance on the use of new and existing
medicines and treatments within the NHS in England and Wales.
• Clinical guidelines—guidance on the appropriate treatment and
care of people with speciﬁc diseases and conditions within the NHS
in England and Wales.
• Interventional procedures—guidance on whether interventional
procedures used for diagnosis or treatment are safe enough and
work well enough for routine use in England, Wales, and Scotland.
• NICE and the National Service Frameworks (produced by the DoH)
are responsible for setting clear national standards for NHS services
and treatments.
• In 2004 the DoH published a document, Standards for better health,
which sets out how NHS organizations should respond to NICE
guidance.

Care Quality Commission
The Commission regularly reviews the performance of trusts, healthcare
providers, and social care providers against the standards set down by
NICE and the National Service Frameworks.
• The functions of the CQC are to:
• regulate the independent healthcare sector through annual
registration and inspection in England
• publish regular ratings of NHS hospitals and trusts, and publish
information about the state of healthcare across the NHS and
independent sector

605

606

CHAPTER 22

Quality and Managerial Issues

• coordinate its NHS inspections with a range of other healthcare
organizations in order to minimize disruption to healthcare staff
• identify how effectively funds are used within healthcare—
particularly whether tax payers are getting good value for money
• investigate serious failures in healthcare services.
• It has also taken over responsibility for handling the independent
review process for complaints about treatment within the NHS.

UK Primary Immunodeﬁciency Network
The UK Primary Immunodeﬁciency Network (UKPIN) (see http://www.
ukpin.org.uk/home/) is a multidisciplinary organization of those caring
for patients with primary immunodeﬁciencies. All nurses, scientists, and
medical practitioners involved in the healthcare of patients with primary
immune deﬁciencies, or in research into these diseases, are deemed to be
members. The aims of UKPIN are:
• development of common approaches to management by means of
setting consensus standards of care
• peer review accreditation scheme for PID centres
• provision of generic protocols based on common practice.
The website has approved and draft clinical guidelines for the management
of PIDs.

Health and safety
In most countries hospitals, and particularly laboratories, are subject to a
signiﬁcant legal framework. In practice this means that the employers are
responsible in law for ensuring that this legal framework is implemented.
• In the UK, a number of organizations have the right to make
unannounced inspections to ensure compliance.
• The Health and Safety Executive (see http://www.hse.gov.uk/) has wide
powers regarding the workplace including, as a last resort, the power
to close an installation down and to bring prosecutions.
• Heads of departments can be held directly accountable for breaches.
• Particularly important are the regulations regarding all chemical and
biological materials (COSHH regulations), which require a full safety
assessment to be carried out on any substance in use or held in the
laboratory.
• These must be held in a written form and read by all employees
using the substances.
• They must contain information on dealing with spills.
• There are commercially available directories (Croner) from which
this information can be obtained, and most manufacturers include
such information in the packaging.
• Strict regulations apply to the use and handling of radio-isotopes, in
particular the route of disposal and the amount of permitted discharge.
• Every hospital will have a radiation protection ofﬁcer, usually a
member of the medical physics team, who will provide guidance and
monitor local compliance.

LABORATORY AND CLINICAL ORGANIZATION

• Breaches of the legislation are viewed seriously, and both hospitals and
individuals have been prosecuted by HM Inspectorate of Pollution.
• The handling of high-risk biological samples is governed by the
guidance produced by the Advisory Committee on Dangerous
Pathogens, under the auspices of HSE (see http://www.hse.gov.uk/
aboutus/meetings/committees/acdp/).
• In the guidance, pathogens are graded according to the potential risk
to workers, and handling facilities and other precautions are laid down.
• Those working in laboratories should treat all samples as being
potentially high risk and take sensible precautions, i.e. wearing gloves,
appropriate laboratory coats (Howie coats, properly buttoned
up!), and disposing of samples safely via an autoclave (Universal
Precautions).
• The use of latex products, i.e. gloves, is covered by COSHH, as latex is
considered a substance hazardous to health—a full risk assessment is
required.
• All staff should be fully immunized, particularly against hepatitis B.
• As part of their induction, all staff (including doctors!) should read the
necessary statutory documentation and also local policies, which need
to be fully documented as one of the CPA accreditation standards.
• The induction should also include annual ﬁre safety training (a
mandatory requirement). This training should be documented for all
staff and is included in the logbooks for trainee clinicians and scientists.

Laboratory and clinical organization
• In the UK, CPA-accredited immunology laboratories must have a
clear management structure with evidence of regular meetings and
consultation.
• A clinician or top-grade scientist must lead the department, assisted
by a laboratory manager (senior BMS or scientist). These two will be
responsible for the management of the department.
• The laboratory will usually be part of a directorate of laboratory
medicine, with a clinical director (either a clinician or top-grade
scientist) who has overall responsibility for the directorate and will
usually be a part of the trust hospital’s higher management structure.
• Heads of department will usually be responsible for a devolved budget
and should be involved in the negotiation of contracts, budget setting,
and personnel matters, with appropriate support from ﬁnance and
personnel departments.
• Management of staff is a major role, and heads of department need
to be aware of the employment legislation, particularly with regard to
equal opportunities and discrimination.
• Staff development is important and CPA expects to see performance
appraisal for all grades in place.
• Clinical heads of department will now also be responsible for all types
of staff, usually assisted by a senior nurse.

607

608

CHAPTER 22

Quality and Managerial Issues

• All junior clinical staff will have nominated consultants who are
responsible for the supervision of their training. Regular appraisal
meetings for junior medical staff are required.

Funding
• As part of the overall drive towards greater consistency and
transparency in the NHS, the ﬂow of funds through the NHS is being
reformed.
• These changes were set out by the DoH in the 2002 consultation
paper ‘Reforming NHS ﬁnancial ﬂows: introducing payment by results’.
• Instead of being commissioned through block agreements as
previously, hospitals and pathology services will be paid for the activity
that they undertake.
• From 1 April 2005 the new system covered around half of hospital
and community health service spending and, for large district general
hospitals, typically some 70% of income is covered by the national
tariff.
• Work continues to develop a national formulary of laboratory tests
and to develop a tariff for them.
• PCTs will commission the volume of activity required to deliver
service priorities from a plurality of providers (including at least 10%
from the independent sector, irrespective of quality or merit!) based
on the national tariff adjusted for regional variations in costs and for
case mix.
• As previous attempts to make the funds follow patients failed in the
1990s, there is little expectation that it will work this time!

Modernizing pathology
• Modernising pathology services, published by the DoH in February 2004,
aims to remove pathology from its isolated ‘support service’ position
into one of the mainstream patients’ services.
• It recognizes the key role of pathology in up to 70% of NHS patients’
diagnoses.
• It recognizes recruitment difﬁculties and underinvestment in modern
equipment.
• It encourages the development of managed pathology networks.
• There are no completely successful examples of managed pathology
networks in England and Wales, despite several large DoH-funded
projects designed to develop networks over multiple hospital sites (big
is not beautiful!).
• Informal arrangements of mutual beneﬁt have been more successful in
achieving rationalization and modernization.
• Currently the DoH is still looking for large savings in pathology
budgets, following the Carter Report. These are unlikely to be
achieved.
• Private takeovers have failed as private companies cannot deliver the
required savings and quality targets and still make a proﬁt!!

TRAINING

Training
Training in immunology in the UK takes place at both a clinical and a technical level (biomedical scientists (BMSs), and clinical scientists).

Medical training
• Basic medical training has changed with the introduction of ‘foundation
schools’.
• All medical graduates will initially enter a two-year foundation
programme.
• In order to gain experience of immunology, it may be possible to
arrange a ‘taster’ attachment to immunology during the foundation
years.
• This will be followed (for a time at least) by SHO posts.
• Following foundation, trainees will compete for specialist training posts
(specialist registrar) which may be ‘run through’ or ‘broad-based’.
• At the stage of selection into immunology, possession of the MRCP or
MRCPCH (or equivalent training abroad approved by JRCPTB) is an
explicit entry criterion.
• Core training currently includes basic science, clinical practice related
to immunology, and laboratory practice, culminating in the part I
examination of the FRCPath, comprising two written papers. Trainees
in immunology must also complete the FRCPath part II, which may
be in the form of a thesis (this may have been submitted for a PhD
or MD, or may be speciﬁcally written for the MRCPath), a casebook,
or submission of a collection of published papers. This is followed by
a practical examination and an oral examination. Details are on the
college website (see http://www.rcpath.org/index.asp?PageID=47 )
• The FRCPath has now been reorganized (again!!). Whether it is ﬁt
for purpose as an assessment of competence to run a laboratory is
debatable.
• Completion of training will be certiﬁed by the award of a certiﬁcate
of specialist training (CST) issued by the GMC which, as of April 2010,
has taken on the roles of PMETB (late and not lamented!) on receipt
of a large fee!

BMS training
• BMS training may be entered through an approved degree in biological
sciences followed by a year of in-service training. Sandwich degrees
exist, and a co-terminus programme is being developed whereby state
registration and award of degree occur simultaneously.
• After 1 year, trainees are required to submit a log-book or training
with a portfolio followed by an oral examination to obtain state
registration with the Health Professions Council (HPC).
• Further progress up the career scale depends on the acquisition of
further qualiﬁcations such as an MSc or a specialist portfolio assessed
by IBMS.

609

610

CHAPTER 22

Quality and Managerial Issues

Clinical scientists
• Clinical scientist trainees will usually start as junior scientists, having
undertaken a primary degree in a relevant subject at university, and
currently go through a 3-year structured programme of training.
• Scientists who have undertaken their training in academic departments
and obtained PhDs are often employed directly as middle-grade
scientists.
• Registration with the HPC is required.
• Progression to consultant scientist level usually depends on acquisition
of the FRCPath in the appropriate discipline, although there is no
written rule requiring this at present.

Agenda for Change
• The concept of ‘Agenda for Change’ is that all staff are paid equally for
work of equal value.
• It applies to all directly employed NHS staff except doctors, dentists,
and senior managers.
• Agenda for Change was rolled out nationally in December 2004.
• There are two pay spines, one for nursing and other health
professions, and a second for all other directly employed NHS staff.
• Detailed assessment of each post using the job evaluation scheme
determines the correct pay band for each post and therefore the
correct basic pay.
• Many trusts have simply translated existing pay levels to the new
spines without proper job evaluation.
• In each pay band there are a number of points in which there should
be progress through each year as skills and knowledge are successfully
developed (KSF: knowledge and skills framework).
• The already grey area of distinction between clinical scientists and BMS
staff will become even more blurred. The opportunity for consultant
BMS staff will exist.
• Old Grade C scientists are mostly band 8 or occasionally band 9.

Modernizing scientiﬁc careers
• Plans are now well advanced to amalgamate BMS and clinical scientist
career structures into a single career pathway.
• The terms ‘clinical scientist’ and ‘BMS’ will disappear and be replaced
by the term ‘healthcare scientist’. Old Grade C/top-grade scientists/
very senior BMS will be called ‘consultant healthcare scientists’.

Writing a business case
All NHS trusts are required to submit annual plans outlining the organization’s plans over the next 3 years. These aim to establish the organization’s priorities as determined by national and local policies. Directorate
business plans contribute to the development of the organization’s business plan. On an annual basis, each directorate outlines the ﬁnancial and
other resources that it requires to deliver its service, what is expected by
the commissioners (previously known as purchasers), and proposals for

WRITING A BUSINESS CASE

service and capital development. A business case is a document that supports the proposals for a new service development or a capital project.
Within pathology, one of the most common reasons for developing
a business case is a response to increasing workload or a need to introduce new tests into the service. The ﬁrst step is informal discussions with
colleagues such as the clinical director and business manager. It is important to identify any ﬁnancial threshold below which directorates will be
expected to fund the developments themselves.
A business case should address three questions.
• Where are we now?
• Where do we want to be?
• How do we get there?

Suggested outline of a written business case
• Executive summary (at the beginning for those too busy/idle to read
long documents!).
• Introduction.
• Describe current service. Identify any national or local policies
that impact on service provision (national service frameworks,
recommendations by CPA (UK)) and need for change based on
differences between existing service and future needs.
• Aims.
• Should be SMART (speciﬁc, measurable, achievable, relevant, and
with a time element).
• Option appraisal.
• State ‘do nothing’ as one option.
• Describe a long list of options and then cut down to a short list of
the most appropriate options.
• Assess each option for beneﬁts and costs.
• Proposal.
• Main section of the business plan.
• Identify the preferred option.
• Summarize why it is superior to other options and the cost-beneﬁt
analysis.
• Identify any risks and how they should be managed.
• Assess the impact of the proposal on pathology and other clinical
directorates.
• Conclusions and recommendations.
• The business case is more likely to be successful if:
• it is a statutory/national requirement that must be implemented,
e.g. National Service Framework (NSF)
• the development is part of an existing strategy
• it requires relatively simple management action with few capital or
revenue consequences
• it has support in clinical directorates outside pathology
• it has a positive impact on waiting times and waiting lists.

CHAPTER 22

Quality and Managerial Issues

Applying for a consultant post
Basic information
• Start looking in the British Medical Journal at least 6 months before you
are going to apply.
• Has the post been advertised before (how often)?
• If possible, get experience.
• Enquire about acting-up as a consultant or doing a locum.
• Think about what sort of job you want (clinical, laboratory, research,
location).
• Is this a new post or a replacement following a departure or retirement?
• Use colleagues to obtain background information about jobs available
or likely to become available.

Responding to the advertisement
• The information pack should include job description and information
on ofﬁce accommodation and secretarial support, job plan, personal
speciﬁcation, and terms and conditions of service. Organizational
information should include business plan, annual report, and healthcare
commission report.
• Ask around among colleagues about the job.
• If there is doubt about the terms and conditions, check with the BMA
(if a member).
• It is a good idea to be a member of either the BMA or the Hospital
Consultants and Specialists Association (HCSA) before applying for
posts.

First visit
• Arrange to meet consultant colleagues, clinical director, business
manager, medical director, chief executive (if possible!).
• Make sure that you have read the information supplied carefully.
• Have a list of questions for those you are going to meet.
• Don’t be taken in by people talking up the job.
• Be suspicious of promises to do things—look for evidence that they
will happen!
• On the way home, list the good points and bad points of the job—do
you still want to apply?
• Be sure that your application is received on time.
• Remember to ask your referees’ permission to use them!

Second visit (after short listing)
• Ask:
• What is the management structure?
• Outcome of last healthcare commission inspection?
• Is there any induction for new consultants?
• Any plans for rationalization of services?
• Outcome of last CPA visit?
• Sample audit trail?
• Travel between sites yourself using normal means of transport.
• Who is the budget holder for your department?

CONSULTANT CONTRACT AND PRIVATE PRACTICE

• What are the arrangements for out- and in-patient services?
• Has a UKPIN inspection been carried out?
• What are the teaching commitments?
• Ask the same question of different people.
• Smile—remember at this point that you are trying to sell yourself as a
desirable colleague!

Preparing for the interview
• Who will be on the committee? Appointments committees may be
very large and will always include a management representative.
• Is a presentation required? If so try to keep a local focus.
• Be up-to-date on current hot topics.
• Prepare answers for key questions. Have a plan of what you would like
to achieve over your ﬁrst few years in post.
• If you don’t think you will accept an offer of the post, don’t go to the
interview. It causes enormous upset, and word will spread.
• If you drop out, make sure you that you telephone the personnel
ofﬁcer well in advance.

At the interview
• Arrive in plenty of time (don’t rely on public transport to get you
there in the nick of time!).
• Wear appropriate sober dress.
• Again, you are there as a salesman, selling yourself.
• Direct your answers to the questioner. Think before speaking and
speak clearly.

After acceptance
• Once you have accepted and before you take up the post is the only
time when you have power to inﬂuence terms and conditions.
• Check which point on the salary scale you have been offered—if
they have had difﬁculty in ﬁlling a post or you have longer than usual
training, you can negotiate a higher starting salary.
• Check contract for unusual terms (check it out with BMA if necessary).
• Check the terms for relocation expenses.
• Appointment is subject to clearance checks with the Criminal Records
Bureau (CRB) and Occupational Health. Do not hand in your notice
until you have a satisfactory written offer and conﬁrmation of CRB/
Occupational Health clearance.

Consultant contract and private
practice
• A new consultant contract has been negotiated. It is time-based rather
than professional.

613

614

CHAPTER 22

Quality and Managerial Issues

• A basic 40-hour week is divided into 10 programmed activities (PAs),
of which 7.5 will be direct clinical care and 2.5 supporting activities
(SPA)—administration, teaching, CPD). However, trusts have been
driving down the time allowed for SPAs to 1.5. This is not supported
by professional bodies.
• Additional PAs may be offered by trusts on a temporary basis to meet
speciﬁed clinical needs.
• Additional payments are made for on-call commitments according to
intensity and frequency.
• Most trusts have found that the work currently delivered exceeds the
PAs for which they are funded!
• Under the new contract, limitations are placed on consultants’ private
practice which must not overlap with deﬁned NHS PAs. However, the
old ‘10% rule’ has been removed for whole-time consultants.
• The job plan forms the basis of determining work patterns and
remuneration, and is separate from appraisal.
• Pay progression is subject to satisfactory appraisal and an agreed job
plan and is no longer automatic.
• Annual appraisal is now required and must be documented by both
the trust and the individual.
• Revamped appraisal will form part of the revalidation process with the
GMC, required to maintain a licence to practice
• This will include 5-yearly multisource feedback and patient feedback
• A GMC-approved responsible ofﬁcer (usually a trust medical
director) will be required to sign off the appraisals as indicating that
the doctor is ﬁt to continue practising.
• Participation in continuing professional development, with
documentary evidence, is a mandatory requirement.
• Trusts may award additional discretionary salary increments for
meritorious service.
• Consultants may apply for higher clinical excellence awards on a
national basis. At least 5 years as a consultant in the NHS is expected.
Applications must be accompanied by a supporting form from the chief
executive. Colleges and professional bodies may make nominations.
• The future of clinical excellence awards is in doubt (rewarding doctors
for performance is not seen to be desirable). Senior doctors will most
likely vote with their feet and retire early.
• Signiﬁcant changes to the NHS superannuation scheme are
taking place and will be detrimental to the pension entitlement of
consultants. Many consultants are taking early retirement as a result
• Further advice is available from the BMA and from the Hospital
Consultants and Specialists Association (HCSA).

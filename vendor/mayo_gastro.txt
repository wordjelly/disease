Preface

Gastroenterology and hepatology encompass a vast anatomical assortment of organs that have diverse structure and function and potentially are afﬂicted by a multiplicity of disease
processes. We have designed the Mayo Clinic Gastroenterology
and Hepatology Board Review course and the revised fourth
edition of this book to assist both physicians-in-training who
are preparing for the gastroenterology board examination and
the increasing number of gastroenterologists awaiting recertiﬁcation. Mayo Clinic Gastroenterology and Hepatology Board
Review is not intended to replace the many more encyclopedic
textbooks of gastroenterology, hepatology, pathology, endoscopy, nutrition, and radiology now available. Nor is this book
intended to serve as an “update” to physicians looking for the
newest advances in the science and art of gastroenterology and
hepatology. Instead, the book provides a core of essential
knowledge in gastroenterology, hepatology, and integral
related areas of pathology, endoscopy, nutrition, and radiology. Clinical knowledge related to diagnostic and therapeutic
approaches to patient management is emphasized. Case-based
presentations and short board examination-type, single bestanswer multiple-choice questions with annotated answers are
featured. This text also is intended to be used by medical students and residents during their clerkships in internal medicine and gastroenterology and by gastroenterology fellows in
training. Physicians in practice should ﬁnd this book to be a
practical review for consolidating their knowledge in gastroenterology and hepatology.

The book is organized by subspecialty topics, including
esophageal disorders, gastroduodenal disorders, small-bowel
disease and nutrition, colonic disorders, pancreaticobiliary
disease, liver disease, and miscellaneous disorders. Numerous
color and black-and-white ﬁgures support the text. Each subspecialty section concludes with a chapter containing board
examination-type, single-best answer multiple-choice questions with annotated answers. (The chapters consisting of
questions and answers are not included in the index.) The faculty responsible for the book (at the time it was produced) all
are Mayo Clinic gastroenterologists and hepatologists who
spend the majority of their time caring for patients but have a
commitment to teaching medical students, house ofﬁcers,
fellows, nurses, and physicians. Most of the faculty have particular interests in subspecialty areas of clinical gastroenterology and hepatology, which provides broad expertise.
We want to thank the staffs of the Section of Scientiﬁc Publications, Media Support Services at Mayo Clinic, and the
Mayo School of Continuous Professional Development for
their contributions. The support of Mayo Clinic Scientiﬁc
Press and the publisher, Oxford University Press, also are
greatly appreciated. We want to give special thanks to our secretaries and to Greg Gores, MD, for his ongoing enthusiasm
and support for our faculty and teaching mission.

Gastroesophageal Reﬂux Diseasea
Joseph A. Murray, MD

Gastroesophageal reﬂux is the reﬂux of gastric contents
other than air into or through the esophagus. Gastroesophageal
reﬂux disease (GERD) refers to reﬂux that produces frequent
symptoms or results in damage to the esophageal mucosa or
contiguous organs of the upper aerodigestive system and occasionally the lower respiratory tract.

Etiologya

Gastroesophageal reﬂux results from several factors that lead
to symptoms or injury of the mucosa of the esophagus or
the airway by reﬂux of corrosive material from the stomach
(Table 1.1). These factors include a weak or defective sphincter, transient lower esophageal sphincter relaxations (TLESRs),
hiatal hernia, poor acid clearance from the esophagus, diminished salivary ﬂow, reduced mucosal resistance to injury,
increased acid production, delayed gastric emptying of solids,
and obstructive sleep apnea (Fig. 1.1). The relative contribution of these varies from patient to patient.

The lower esophageal sphincter and its attached structures
form a barrier to reﬂux of material across the esophagogastric
junction and is the central protection against pathologic reﬂux
of gastric contents into the esophagus. This barrier has several
components, including the smooth muscle lower esophageal
sphincter, the gastric sling ﬁbers, and the striated muscle crural
diaphragm. The lower esophageal sphincter maintains tone at
rest and relaxes with swallowing and gastric distention as a
venting reﬂex. This latter relaxation has been termed transient

Defective

clearance
Lower
esophageal
sphincter
‘dysfunction’

The presence of hiatal hernia has an important role in
defective barrier function, both by removing the augmentation that the crural diaphragm provides the lower esophageal
sphincter and lowering the threshold for TLESRs to occur.
Acid Clearance

Hiatal hernia

Delayed gastric
emptying
Increased
intra-abdominal
pressure

The clearance of acid from the esophagus is a combination of
mechanical volume clearance (gravity and peristalsis) and
chemical neutralization of the lumen contents (saliva and
mucosal buffering). This may be delayed in patients with
reﬂux because of either impaired esophageal peristalsis or
reduced buffering effects of swallowed saliva. The defective
peristalsis can be a primary idiopathic motor disorder or,
occasionally, it can result from a connective tissue disorder
such as CREST (calcinosis cutis, Raynaud’s phenomenon,
esophageal dysfunction, sclerodactyly, and telangiectasia) syndrome or scleroderma. Many drugs and Sjögren’s syndrome
can decrease salivary ﬂow. Normally, salivary ﬂow is decreased
at night; thus, if reﬂux occurs during the night when the person
is supine, acid will not be cleared by either gravity or saliva.
This is why episodes of reﬂux at night are long-lasting and
have a greater chance of causing severe injury to the mucosa.

lower esophageal sphincter relaxation (TLESR). In persons with
mild reﬂux disease, acid liquid contents instead of air alone are
vented, resulting in many episodes of acid reﬂux. In patients
with severe reﬂux, the resting pressure of the lower esophageal
sphincter usually is diminished and easily overcome.

Intrinsic Mucosal Factors

The mucosa of the esophagus has intrinsic factors that protect
the esophageal lining against acid damage. These include the
stratiﬁed squamous mucosa, intercellular tight junctions,
growth factors, buffering blood ﬂow, and production of
mucin, bicarbonate, and epidermal growth factors. When
these factors are overcome, GERD causes reﬂux esophagitis
(Fig. 1.2 and 1.3).

tissue damage in gastroesophageal reﬂux disease is as follows: A and B, Acid-peptic attack weakens cell junctions and, C, widens the cell gaps,
thus allowing acid penetration. Exposure to gastric acid and pepsin can cause microscopic damage to the esophageal mucosa, which may
not be visible endoscopically but still result in heartburn. (Adapted from AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LP [Internet]. Wilmington [DE].

Gastric Factors

Delayed gastric emptying or increased gastric production of
acid is less frequently part of GERD. Reﬂux esophagitis is
rarely a manifestation of Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. The
availability of corrosive gastric contents in the cardia of the
stomach is necessary for reﬂux to occur during TLESR or when
a defective lower esophageal sphincter is overcome during
recumbency or abdominal straining. The cardia is often submerged under liquid gastric contents in the recumbent, especially in the right lateral decubitus, position. It has been
suggested recently that what differentiates patients with GERD
from normal subjects is not the number of actual reﬂux events
but the reﬂux of acidic gastric contents instead of the release of
air alone. The timing of reﬂux is also important. Because gastric acid is buffered by food during the ﬁrst hour after eating,
normal physiologic reﬂux that may occur during maximal
gastric distention is not as harmful as the reﬂux that occurs
later after the stomach pH has again decreased. Any obstruction of the outﬂow from the stomach increases the propensity
to reﬂux, although this is often associated with nausea and
vomiting. Pure bile reﬂux may occur in patients who have had
gastric surgery. More common is pathologic reﬂux associated
with a restrictive bariatric procedure such as vertical banded
gastroplasty. If too much acid-producing mucosa is present
above the restriction, pathologic reﬂux may occur.
Helicobacter pylori and Gastroesophageal
Reﬂux Disease

Whether chronic Helicobacter pylori infection protects against
GERD is a matter of controversy. Duodenal ulcers and distal
gastric cancer (both caused by H pylori infection) are becoming

rare in the developed world, and adenocarcinoma of the proximal stomach and esophagus is becoming more common as
the carriage rates of H pylori decrease. Patients with GERD
symptoms may be less likely to carry H pylori than the population without GERD symptoms. Reports that symptoms of
GERD developed after the eradication of H pylori have led to a
reexamination of those treatment trials of duodenal ulcers,
which included H pylori eradication, for the new development
of GERD symptoms. The evidence is conﬂicting whether the
symptoms of GERD are more common in those in whom
H pylori eradication has been successful or in those with persistent infection. In some persons, H pylori infection may
cause chronic atrophic gastritis that affects the corpus of the
stomach, resulting in diminished acid secretion. It is this relative hypochlorhydria that protects against GERD. Indeed, it
has been suggested that acid suppression heals reﬂux esophagitis faster in patients with H pylori infection (Fig. 1.4). Other
explanations for the apparent occurrence of GERD after the
eradication of H pylori may include unrecognized GERD
injury or symptoms present before eradication, rebound acid
secretion after cessation of potent acid suppression, or other
unrelated factors.
Connective Tissue Disease

Scleroderma, CREST syndrome, or mixed connective tissue
diseases are rare causes of reﬂux, but these should be considered in young women who have Raynaud’s phenomenon or
subtle cutaneous features of scleroderma in the hands or face.
Occasionally, GERD may be the ﬁrst manifestation of these
disorders. Esophageal manometry usually demonstrates a
low-pressure lower esophageal sphincter and decreased amplitude of contractions in the esophagus (Fig. 1.5).

GERD can be deﬁned as chronic symptoms of heartburn, acid
regurgitation or dysfunction, or injury to the esophagus or
other organs because of abnormal reﬂux of gastric contents.
Symptoms suggestive of GERD are common: 40% of the
adult population in the United States report heartburn monthly
and 18% report it weekly (Fig. 1.7). GERD becomes more
common with increasing age (Fig. 1.8). Previously, GERD

19

The mechanism for extraesophageal manifestations of GERD,
such as wheeze or cough, may not always be direct aspiration
or damage of mucosa in the respiratory tract but a vagally
mediated reﬂex triggered by acidiﬁcation of the distal esophageal mucosa. Subglottic stenosis and granuloma of the vocal
cords are very serious consequences of reﬂux caused by direct
contact injury of the delicate mucosa of the airway, resulting
in stridor, cough, or dysphonia (Fig. 1.6).

and its complications were rare in China, Japan, and other
Asian countries, but this is changing rapidly with the adoption
of a Western diet. A protective role of H pylori–induced
hypochlorhydria has been suggested as a protective inﬂuence
in countries with high carriage rates of infection. However,
actual organ damage is observed less frequently, and fewer
than 50% of patients who present for medical attention for
reﬂux symptoms have esophagitis. Of patients who have
endoscopy for GERD, 10% have benign strictures and only 3%
to 4% have Barrett’s esophagus; an extremely small number

common in males and whites and with advancing age. Whether
reﬂux is becoming more common is not clear, but it certainly
is diagnosed more frequently than in the past. Also, because of
direct-to-consumer advertising and public education campaigns, the public is more aware of GERD.
For patients with GERD, the quality of life may be impaired
even more than for those with congestive heart failure or

Figure 1.9 Gastroesophageal reﬂux disease has a greater effect on quality of life than other common diseases. Quality of life, assessed by the

PGWBI, was compared between patients with untreated gastroesophageal reﬂux disease and those with other disorders. For example, the
mean PGWBI score of patients with untreated erosive esophagitis is similar to that of patients with untreated duodenal ulcer and lower
(ie, worse) than that of patients with angina pectoris or mild heart failure. Normal scores are 101 for women and 103 for men, but they vary
slightly from country to country. (Data from Dimenas E. Methodological aspects of evaluation of Quality of Life in upper gastrointestinal

health economic effects because, currently, proton pump
inhibitors are among the most commonly prescribed and
most expensive drugs.

Presentation

The classic symptoms of GERD, that is, heartburn and acid
regurgitation, are common in the general population and usually are readily recognized. GERD may be manifested in a wide
array of esophageal and extraesophageal symptoms. GERD
may contribute to many clinical syndromes, either as a
common factor or a rare culprit (Table 1.2).

Symptoms
Esophageal Symptoms

The cardinal symptoms of GERD are heartburn (deﬁned as
retrosternal burning ascending toward the neck) and acid
regurgitation (the unpleasant return of sour or bitter gastric
contents to the pharynx). This is to be differentiated from the
nonacid (bland) regurgitation of retained esophageal contents
in an obstructed esophagus, as occurs in achalasia or the
almost volitional regurgitation of recently swallowed food
which is remasticated and again swallowed that typiﬁes rumination. Patient symptoms of “GERD,” “reﬂux,” and “heartburn” should be differentiated from the burning epigastric
sensation of dyspepsia.
Patients may report relief of symptoms with antacids or
milk. The symptoms of heartburn and especially acid regurgitation are speciﬁc for GERD. Their presence with sufﬁcient
frequency and severity alone usually justiﬁes medical therapy.

Objective conﬁrmation is required before surgery or endoscopic treatment is recommended.
Although regurgitation of acid is a speciﬁc symptom highly
suggestive of GERD, heartburn may have many different meanings for patients, and, indeed, patients may use different and
imprecise terms to describe their symptoms, such as “indigestion,” “stomach upset,” and “sour stomach.” Less common
symptoms suggestive of but not diagnostic of GERD include
water brash (hypersalivation associated with an episode of
esophageal acid exposure), dysphagia (difﬁculty swallowing),
odynophagia (painful swallowing), and chest discomfort not
identiﬁed as heartburn. Reﬂux is more common after eating.
Although reﬂux symptoms can occur at any time, they tend to
aggregate in the period 1 to 3 hours after eating, when acid production overcomes the buffering effects of food (Fig. 1.10). It
has been reported that a layer of acid may remain unbuffered on
the surface of the gastric meal contents. Reﬂux may occur also at
night or when a person with a weak lower esophageal sphincter
is supine or, especially, in the right lateral decubitus position.
Esophageal Chest Pain

GERD is the most common esophageal cause of noncardiac
chest pain. The pain may be referred to any point on the anterior or posterior chest, with radiation to the neck, arm, or back.
It may be indistinguishable from cardiac pain. Because of
the potential fatal signiﬁcance of cardiac pain, it is imperative
that cardiac investigation precede esophageal investigation.
Frequently, patients who have both cardiac and esophageal
diseases cannot distinguish between reﬂux-associated pain and
real angina. GERD may decrease the threshold for coronary
ischemia, further confusing the clinical picture. This emphasizes the importance of ﬁrst investigating the heart and, when
appropriate, other vital structures.

GERD may contribute to symptoms originating in other areas
of the upper aerodigestive system. These symptoms, which
can occur without the classic symptoms of heartburn and acid
regurgitation, include cough, wheeze, hoarseness, sore throat,
repetitive throat clearing, postnasal drip, neck or throat pain,
globus, apnea, and otalgia. They are not speciﬁc for GERD.
Indeed, GERD is only one of many causes of most of these
symptoms. Like GERD, cough and wheezing are very common
and likely to coexist by chance alone. Whether these symptoms are due to GERD needs to be conﬁrmed by investigation
or by the response to an empiric trial of potent acid-blocking
therapy. Ideally, the demonstration of a pathologic degree of
GERD and a response of the atypical symptoms to an adequate
antireﬂux regimen are needed to conclude that GERD is the
cause. GERD may produce extraesophageal symptoms in one
of two ways. The ﬁrst is by direct irritation or inﬂammation of
the delicate mucosa of the larynx, trachea, or bronchi. The
second is by reﬂex-mediated changes in function. Both mechanisms may operate in some patients.

Establishing a Diagnosis

Several studies have investigated the usefulness of empirical
trials of acid-suppressive therapy with proton pump inhibitors
(Table 1.3).

treatment is discontinued conﬁrm the diagnosis and suggest
the need for a long-term management strategy. However, even
in these patients, the speciﬁcity of a response to potent acid
suppression is not speciﬁc for GERD because other acid peptic
disorders respond to acid-suppressive therapy. If symptomatic improvement is limited, either an increase in dose or
additional diagnostic testing is needed. If there is little or no
symptomatic improvement with acid-suppressive therapy,
further investigation is indicated.
Atypical Symptoms of Gastroesophageal
Reﬂux Disease

GERD may cause or contribute to many different clinical syndromes. The more common or dangerous causes of these syndromes should be evaluated ﬁrst. For example, patients with
chronic cough or hoarseness should be evaluated for asthma or
laryngeal neoplasm, respectively. If GERD is a possible cause, a
therapeutic trial of acid suppression may be attempted. For
esophageal symptoms such as chest pain, a 2-week trial of therapy usually is sufﬁcient. For extraesophageal symptoms, a more
prolonged therapeutic trial (2-3 months) may be necessary.
The acid-suppression test uses a potent regimen of acid
suppression, for example, proton pump inhibitors (omeprazole, 40 mg in the morning and 20 mg in the evening). If the
symptoms resolve, the patient should receive long-term treatment, with an attempt at dose reduction or cessation. For atypical symptoms, it is important to consider that they may have
had alternative causes that resolved spontaneously. However,
if there are reversible factors that are altered and if GERD is
the major cause, the symptoms are likely to recur when therapy

10

Section I Esophagus

is discontinued. If the symptoms do not resolve completely,
further evaluation with upper endoscopy or 24-hour ambulatory esophageal pH monitoring with symptom-reﬂux correlation (or both) is indicated. Ideally, the test should be conducted
when the patient is not taking a proton pump inhibitor.
If GERD is conﬁrmed, long-term acid-suppressive therapy
is indicated. If symptoms persist, ambulatory esophageal pH
monitoring may be repeated to document that the esophagus
is no longer exposed to acid.

Diagnostic Tests for Gastroesophageal
Reﬂux Disease

Diagnostic tests are unnecessary for most persons with GERD.
Investigations should be conducted in patients who have alarm
symptoms, equivocal results on a treatment trial, or atypical
symptoms of sufﬁcient importance to warrant conﬁrmation of
GERD and in those undergoing surgical or endoscopic therapy
for GERD. For most patients, the endoscopic demonstration
of esophagitis is sufﬁcient proof of GERD and further investigation is unnecessary. However, more than 50% of patients
with symptoms typical of GERD have normal endoscopic
ﬁndings, and additional tests are required to identify increased
esophageal exposure to acid. This is done either directly with
ambulatory pH monitoring or indirectly by showing the reﬂux
of a detectable material such as barium or a radiolabeled compound during a provocative maneuver or by reproducing
symptoms through the instillation of acid (Table 1.4).
Endoscopic Examination

Endoscopic examination allows direct visualization of the
esophageal mucosa. In reﬂux esophagitis, the characteristic

ﬁnding is linear erosions in the distal esophagus. These usually
start at the esophagogastric junction and extend for various
distances. The degree of severity varies. By their appearance
alone, these erosions usually are readily differentiated from
rarer infectious, allergic (eosinophilic), or corrosive causes of
inﬂammation. If the diagnosis is in question, biopsy specimens should be obtained, not primarily to conﬁrm reﬂux but
to identify alternative pathologic conditions.
Several grading schemes, generally based on the extent of
involvement, have been used. The Los Angeles classiﬁcation
system is the one used most commonly worldwide (Fig. 1.11).
Erythema and increased vascularity are nonspeciﬁc features,
and a break in the mucosa is required to make the diagnosis of
reﬂux esophagitis. Careful scrutiny of the esophagogastric junction with adequate air insufﬂation is needed to examine the
mucosa in its entirety. Endoscopy identiﬁes the esophageal complications of GERD, including esophageal ulceration and stricture, Barrett’s esophagus, and esophageal adenocarcinoma.
Alarm symptoms that suggest these complications include long
duration (>10 years) of typical symptoms, dysphagia, hematemesis or melena, and weight loss. The presence of these symptoms
is a strong indication for diagnostic testing, especially endoscopy.
Male sex, middle age, and nocturnal heartburn may be associated with a higher risk of esophagitis and its complications.
Barium Upper Gastrointestinal Tract Series

Although the barium contrast study is a readily available test,
it is of limited usefulness in the evaluation of patients with
GERD. Its major usefulness in GERD is in identifying strictures and large hiatal hernias. It is insensitive for detecting
erosions or superﬁcial mucosal changes. The ability to reﬂux
barium while at rest or in response to a provocative maneuver
or postural change is not a sensitive test for GERD because
most patients have a normal-pressure lower esophageal
sphincter. In patients with extraesophageal symptoms, reﬂux
of barium to or above the level of the aortic arch suggests the
possibility of proximal reﬂux. The contrast study has limited
value in detecting mucosal changes other than the most pronounced inﬂammation, which requires a double contrast
study. The sensitivity for GERD is only 20%. When provocative maneuvers are added, the sensitivity increases but at great
cost to speciﬁcity. A barium contrast study may be useful in
delineating postoperative anatomical relationships and the
intactness of an antireﬂux repair. Its use is discouraged in the
evaluation of uncomplicated GERD.
Prolonged Ambulatory Esophageal pH
Monitoring Studies

Ambulatory pH monitoring of the esophageal lumen, a wellestablished test, was introduced in the early 1970s. It provides
objective evidence of the degree of GERD and its timing. For
most patients with symptoms of GERD and for whom the diagnosis is not in doubt, this test is not needed. The indications for
ambulatory esophageal pH monitoring are listed in Table 1.5.

Done on acid blockade.

The test is performed with a probe that has a pH sensor at its
tip. The tip is placed 5 cm above the proximal border of the
lower esophageal sphincter. Accurate location of this sphincter is critical because normal values for acid exposure apply
only if the distance between the pH probe and the sphincter is
5 cm. The position of the lower esophageal sphincter usually is
determined manometrically with a standard stationary esophageal manometry study or with a combined single waterperfused pressure transducer with a pH probe that can locate
accurately the proximal border of the sphincter and requires
only a single intubation. Other methods such as endoscopic
measurement and pH step-up on withdrawal are not sufﬁciently accurate for the placement of the nasoesophageal
probe. The pH is recorded by a small portable recorder. A
newer method uses a tubeless pH capsule that is pinned to the
distal esophagus 6 cm above the endoscopically determined
squamocolumnar junction. It transmits the pH measurements
to a recorder worn on the chest. Its advantages are that it can
record for prolonged periods and patients may eat more normally, without the discomfort of the nasal tube. The patient
should maintain his or her usual diet, activity, and habits
during the study to allow the assessment of ﬁndings relative to
the patient’s normal lifestyle. The recorders have a patientactivated event button (or buttons) to indicate meals, changes
in posture, and symptom events. The duration of the recording

must be long enough to reﬂect all periods of the day, especially
postprandial periods. Ideally, 20 hours or more of analyzable
recordings are made.
The recordings are analyzed initially by visual inspection of
the graphs and then by computer-assisted quantitative analysis
of the number and duration of reﬂux episodes and the relation
to any symptoms the patient may have recorded (Fig. 1.12).
Reﬂux of acid is deﬁned as a sudden decrease in intraesophageal
pH <4.0 that lasts longer than 5 seconds. The six most commonly reported measurements are 1) the percentage of total
time that pH is <4.0, 2) the percentage of upright time that pH
is <4.0, 3) the percentage of recumbent time that pH is <4.0, 4)
the total number of reﬂux events, 5) the number of reﬂux episodes that last longer than 5 minutes, and 6) the longest episode of reﬂux (in minutes). The ﬁrst three measurements of
acid exposure are used most frequently in everyday practice,
and combined, they have a reported sensitivity of 85% and a
speciﬁcity greater than 95% for diagnosing GERD associated
with esophagitis. Another important strength of ambulatory
esophageal pH monitoring is its ability to determine whether a
temporal relation exists between the patient’s recorded symptoms and acid reﬂux. This determination is made initially by
examining the tracing on which the symptom events have been
marked and then performing a semiquantitative analysis.
Several measures have been used to calculate the correlation between symptoms and reﬂux, including the symptom
index (ie, the percentage of symptom events that occur at the
time of an acid reﬂux event). A symptom index greater than
50% usually is regarded as signiﬁcant. The symptom sensitivity
index is the percentage of reﬂux events associated with symptoms. A symptom sensitivity index greater than 5% usually is
regarded to indicate an association between symptoms and
acid reﬂux. More recently, the symptom association probability has been used as a more robust test for association. The
ability to determine whether a temporal association exists

depends on the number of symptom events and the amount of
reﬂux that occurs. The patient must record his or her symptoms diligently and accurately during the study. If the symptoms occur once a week, there is little use in performing pH
testing.
The 24-hour ambulatory esophageal pH monitoring test
has limitations. Absolute values for sensitivity and speciﬁcity
have been estimated because no standards exist for comparison with prolonged ambulatory pH monitoring. Also, pH
monitoring may give false-negative results in 17% of patients
with proven erosive esophagitis. This may reﬂect day-to-day
variability in reﬂux or patients may have limited their diet or
activities that would lead to reﬂux. Even simultaneous recording of pH from adjacent sensors may give different results in
20% of subjects. Some patients have a physiologic degree of
acid reﬂux but have a strong correlation between the shortlived reﬂux events and symptoms. This may be due to a hypersensitive esophagus. Patients who frequently have symptoms
of heartburn but no corresponding reﬂux may have what is
termed functional heartburn.
Generally, pH monitoring is performed when the patient is
not taking any acid-suppressive medication. However, occasionally and for speciﬁc indications, pH monitoring may be
performed when a patient is taking these medications. These
indications include frequent typical reﬂux symptoms that
are refractory to what should be adequate acid-suppressive

therapy with usual doses of proton pump inhibitors. Another
indication is persistent extraesophageal symptoms despite
high-dose proton pump inhibitor therapy in patients with
conﬁrmed reﬂux disease. Usually, a prerequisite for performing the test while the patient is receiving treatment is that the
diagnosis of GERD is fairly certain and the intent is to verify
that the suppression of acid reﬂux is complete.
Establishing a temporal correlation between symptoms
and acid reﬂux events may be a secondary aim of the study.
However, heartburn and regurgitation may occur in the
absence of acid reﬂux. This may be due to nonacid reﬂux,
gastric dyspepsia, rumination, or an unrelated process. A
newer technique that measures both pH and intraluminal
impedance may be able to detect nonacid reﬂux, but its role is
not fully accepted and its clinical usefulness has not been demonstrated. Often, gastric pH is measured simultaneously to
assess the degree of gastric acid suppression. Approximately
one-third of patients receiving regular doses of proton pump
inhibitors have marked production of acid in the stomach at
night, but this breakthrough acid production does not always
produce symptoms or actual esophageal acid reﬂux.
Gastroesophageal Scintigraphy

Gastroesophageal scintigraphy is used rarely to demonstrate
gastroesophageal reﬂux or aspiration. The technique involves

1 Gastroesophageal Reﬂux Disease

feeding the patient a technetium 99m sulfur colloid-labeled
meal and obtaining postprandial images with a gamma camera.
Delayed images obtained the following morning may show
scintigraphic activity within the lung ﬁelds, demonstrating
aspiration (usually, gross aspiration is needed). The test may
be more useful in patients who have concomitant symptoms
of delayed gastric emptying.
Bernstein Test

The Bernstein test is a provocative test in which acid (0.1N
HCl) and water are infused alternately through a nasoesophageal tube into the midesophagus, with the patient unaware of
the order of infusion. Of patients with GERD, 70% complain
of heartburn within a few minutes after the start of the infusion of acid. Ideally, the symptom is relieved promptly
when water is instilled. Because of low sensitivity and poor
tolerance of the infusion, this test is not performed frequently.
Great care must be taken to ensure that the tube is not in the
airway, because instillation of acid into the lungs may have
severe consequences.

Treatment

Patient- or physician-initiated empirical treatment for presumed GERD has become commonplace. Indeed, guidelines
for primary care have supported this approach for patients
who do not have alarm symptoms. Treatment options for
GERD are summarized in Table 1.6. Potent acid suppression
with proton pump inhibitors is effective and heals reﬂux
esophagitis after only a few weeks of therapy. This has resulted

in a shift in the disease as it appears to endoscopists. It is rare
to ﬁnd severe disease in patients who have been treated with
proton pump inhibitors. This practice poses a problem when
symptoms do not resolve as expected. Perhaps there is partial
improvement in symptoms. Although the diagnosis of GERD
was suggested at the time of presentation and initiation of
proton pump inhibitor therapy, the disease cannot be conﬁrmed by the usual method without stopping the medications
for a substantial time, and this may not be acceptable to
patients in whom proton pump inhibitors have healed the
esophagitis. A careful reexamination of the pretreatment
symptoms may show that what the patient thought was GERD
may have been something else, for example, dyspepsia.
Acid-suppressive therapy is the cornerstone of the treatment of GERD. It provides excellent healing and relief of
symptoms in patients with esophagitis or classic heartburn.
The relief appears to be related directly to the degree of acid
suppression achieved.
Long-term maintenance therapy is needed for most
patients. Lifestyle modiﬁcations alone may produce remission
in 25% of patients with symptoms, but only a few patients are
compliant with the restrictions. The same principles that apply
to short-term therapy apply also to long-term therapy. Less
acid equals less recurrence.
Histamine2 Receptor Blockers

Histamine2 (H2) receptor blockers act by blocking the
histamine-induced stimulation of gastric parietal cells. H2
blockers provide moderate beneﬁt when given in moderate
doses (cimetidine 400 mg twice daily, famotidine 20 mg twice
daily, nizatidine 150 mg twice daily, ranitidine 150 mg twice
daily) and heal esophagitis in 50% of patients. Higher doses
suppress acid more rapidly. Lower doses are less effective, and
nighttime-only dosing misses all the daytime reﬂux that predominates. A particular role for H2 blockers may be to augment proton pump inhibitors when given at night to block
nocturnal acid breakthrough; however, nocturnal H2 blockade
does not produce sustained nocturnal acid suppression,
because of tachyphylaxis.
Proton Pump Inhibitors

Proton pump inhibitors are absorbed rapidly and taken up
and concentrated preferentially in parietal cells. They irreversibly complex with the H+, K+-ATPase pump, which is the
ﬁnal step in acid production. To produce acid, parietal cells
must form new pumps, a process that takes many hours.
Proton pump inhibitors are more potent than H2 blockers as
suppressors of acid reﬂux. The healing of esophagitis and the
relief of symptoms are more rapid with proton pump inhibitors than with H2 blockers. With proton pump inhibitor therapy, esophagitis heals within 4 weeks in more than 80% of
patients and in virtually 100% by 8 weeks. However, the
rate of complete relief from symptoms is less than the rate of
healing.

14

Section I Esophagus

Whether a proton pump inhibitor should be given as initial
therapy and then replaced with H2 blocker therapy or whether
H2 blocker therapy should precede proton pump inhibitor
therapy is debated. Economic analysis, which takes into
account the patient’s quality of life, suggests that the latter
approach is preferred. It is well established that therapy sometimes can be “stepped down” successfully after treatment with
a proton pump inhibitor or switched to on-demand therapy,
although this is rarely suitable for patients with substantial
complications of GERD. This approach is not recommended
unless cost considerations are paramount.
Although routine doses of proton pump inhibitors (esomeprazole 40 mg/day, lansoprazole 30 mg/day, omeprazole
20 mg/day, pantoprazole 40 mg/day, rabeprazole 20 mg/day)
are adequate for most patients with GERD, some may require
higher or more frequent dosing to suppress GERD completely.
Data have demonstrated that proton pump inhibitors are not
entirely effective in blocking nocturnal production of acid in
the stomach. Complete acid blockade can be achieved by dose
escalation or by adding a nocturnal H2 blocker. However, the
latter strategy does not have a sustained effect, nor is it clear
that complete suppression of gastric acid is desirable.
Incomplete blockade may be the result of differences in
metabolism or bioavailability. Omeprazole is absorbed more
readily on an empty stomach and is most effective if the stomach parietal cells are stimulated. This is achieved by having
patients eat within an hour after taking the medication.
With maintenance proton pump inhibitor therapy, the rate
of relapse of esophagitis is 20% or less, which is lower than for
H2 blockers (Fig. 1.13). A slight escalation in dose may be
needed with long-term therapy. Also, maintenance proton
pump inhibitor therapy is more effective than H2 blockers in

reducing the need for redilatation in patients with reﬂux-associated benign strictures.
Proton pump inhibitor therapy causes a clinically insigniﬁcant increase in the serum level of gastrin. Although this has
caused concern about a theoretical risk of carcinoid, the risk
has not been realized after more than 10 years of long-term
use of these agents. The increase in serum levels of gastrin and
parietal cell mass may lead to rebound acid secretion after the
therapy is stopped. The same effect also occurs, but for a
shorter time, after H2 blocker therapy is stopped. Epidemiologic studies have raised also the possibility of an association
between proton pump inhibitor therapy and hip fractures.
Prokinetics

The idea that a motility disorder is the genesis of GERD made
a prokinetic approach intellectually enticing. Drugs such as
metoclopramide and, formerly, cisapride, which increase the
tone of the lower esophageal sphincter and esophageal clearance and accelerate gastric emptying, have been used to treat
reﬂux. However, the healing rate and safety of these drugs
have been questioned. Cisapride has been effectively withdrawn from use in the United States, and the long-term use of
metoclopramide is associated with so many adverse effects
that it is rarely prescribed for GERD unless that is incidental to
its use for gastroparesis. Several prokinetic agents are being
studied for the treatment of GERD, but the lower efﬁcacy of
prokinetics compared with that of proton pump inhibitors
limits their potential usefulness. Drugs that target the TLESRs
also have been used, including baclofen, which probably
can reduce reﬂux but is not approved or widely used for that
indication.

Refractory Reﬂux

Surgical and Endoscopic Antireﬂux Procedures

Refractory reﬂux disease can be deﬁned as symptoms of GERD
that are refractory to treatment with regular dosages of proton
pump inhibitors. The many common causes of refractory
reﬂux symptoms are listed in Table 1.7.

What is the role of laparoscopic and endoscopic methods of
therapy? Medical therapy has been reduced to acid neutralization or suppression of acid production. Surgeons and endoscopists have focused on the role of the mechanical or functional
failure of the antireﬂux barrier, and this has become the prime
target of various approaches for preventing the reﬂux of gastric contents into the esophagus.
For many years, antireﬂux surgery was performed through
a transabdominal or transthoracic approach, with considerable morbidity. Surgical treatment was reserved for intractable
reﬂux that the available weak medical therapy failed to cure.
With the advent of proton pump inhibitors, even severe
degrees of reﬂux came to be well controlled, although the
therapy is expensive. With the advent of minimally invasive
surgery, surgical treatment has had a renaissance. The laparoscopic antireﬂux procedure has become a staple of the community surgeon. Its outcomes are similar to those of the open
approach. With well-chosen patients and experienced surgeons, an 80% to 90% success rate is expected. The success
rate decreases remarkably if the patients have symptoms
refractory to proton pump inhibitor therapy or poorly documented reﬂux disease and if the procedure is performed by
less experienced surgeons. A substantial number of these
patients resume taking acid-blocking medications, often for
unclear reasons.
Preoperatively, it is important to verify that the patient’s
symptoms are due in fact to reﬂux. This is accomplished by
documenting reﬂux esophagitis and a response to proton
pump inhibitor therapy or by conﬁrming the pathologic
degree of reﬂux with a 24-hour pH assessment while the
patient is not receiving therapy. If the patient belches frequently, he or she should be informed that belching may
not be possible after the operation and gas bloat may result.
Preoperative esophageal manometry has been widely recommended. It identiﬁes a severe motility disturbance such
as achalasia or connective tissue disease, and some surgeons
want conﬁrmation of a weak lower esophageal sphincter (if
present).
Postoperatively, 20% of patients have some dysphagia, but
this persists in only 5%. Gas bloat, diarrhea, and dyspepsia
may occur or become more evident postoperatively and may
be troubling to patients. As many as one-third of the patients
may still require proton pump inhibitor therapy postoperatively for persistent reﬂux or dyspepsia. Patients who have
respiratory symptoms, free regurgitation, or simple but severe
heartburn without gastric symptoms seem to have the best
response to antireﬂux surgery. Female sex, lack of objective
evidence of pathologic reﬂux, and failure to respond to proton
pump inhibitor therapy all predict a poor response to surgery.
Patient selection and operator experience seem to be the main
determinants of a favorable surgical outcome. Reﬂux surgery
is superior to long-term treatment with H2 blockers to maintain the healing of GERD; however, follow-up for more
than 10 years has shown an unexplained increase in mortality,

Functional Chest Pain

Many patients who complain the most bitterly of severe reﬂux
often have very little reﬂux on 24-hour pH monitoring and
have no endoscopic features of reﬂux. This condition has been
termed nonerosive reﬂux disease. As with other functional gastrointestinal tract problems, females are overrepresented.
Features of anxiety, panic, hyperventilation, and somatization
may be clues to the diagnosis. Antacid therapies may help
reduce the frequency of the symptoms, but they rarely relieve
them completely. Therapies aimed at decreasing visceral
hypersensitivity may be helpful, for example, a low dose of an
antidepressant.

group.
Who Not to Send to Surgery

It would be prudent to reconsider carefully the wisdom of sending to surgery a patient who has symptoms that are refractory
to proton pump inhibitors. A hypersensitive esophagus or gastric dysmotility may be worse after fundoplication. Also, symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome may worsen postoperatively.
Endoscopic Methods of Therapy

Several endoscopic methods have been tried or are in development for the treatment of GERD. Endoscopic methods to alter
the shape or to tighten the esophagogastric junction are in
various stages of development. These consist of inserting
sutures or other devices into the gastric wall to generate a
mechanical barrier or “speed bump” to reﬂux. Although some
of these methods have been in clinical use, evidence for longterm efﬁcacy is lacking.
Eosinophilic Esophagitis

The most common cause of esophagitis has been acid reﬂux
disease; however, over the last 10 years, a truly emerging disorder, eosinophilic esophagitis, has come to the fore. This typically occurs in adults with dysphagia and a history of food
impaction. It occurs in young adults and children and more
frequently in men than in women. In children, symptoms
typically are vomiting and regurgitation in addition to dysphagia. Most patients with this disorder have a history of atopy
or a family history of atopy. Many have other atopic illnesses,
including allergic rhinitis and asthma. Many patients have
identiﬁed reactions to foods, although this is documented
better in children than in adults. In addition to the classic history of episodic dysphagia or food impaction, adults who
present with eosinophilic esophagitis may or may not have
symptoms suggestive of reﬂux disease.

Treatment

Treatment is largely symptomatic. The use of topical corticosteroids appears to be ﬁrst-line therapy, at least for adults. In
children, food avoidance strategies, including elimination
diets or the “six allergen”-reduced diet, have been used with
some beneﬁt. The use of intermittent dilatation has also been
supported, particularly in adults, although many physicians
would restrict the use of dilatation to dominant strictures that
have resisted or have not responded to treatment with topical
corticosteroids. Other agents have been tried, including experimental biologic therapies, to decrease the inﬁltration of
eosinophils.
Most patients have a response to topical corticosteroid
treatment and some have a response to food manipulation,
but the long-term outcome is uncertain. Concerns about the
possibility of scarring and stricturing that require dilatation
have been raised. Occasionally, airway strictures have been
described in patients with eosinophilic esophagitis.
The potential overlap between eosinophilic esophagitis and
reﬂux esophagitis is signiﬁcant. Reﬂux esophagitis can be
associated with occasional inﬁltration of eosinophils in the
esophagus. In contrast, eosinophilic esophagitis is associated
usually with at least 15 eosinophils per high-powered ﬁeld.
Although the appropriate threshold for making the diagnosis
of eosinophilic esophagitis is debated, several eosinophils in
biopsy samples, especially in samples from the middle and
proximal esophagus, should strongly suggest the possibility of
eosinophilic esophagitis. Sampling variation may also be a
consideration because in some patients only speciﬁc locations
are involved by eosinophilic inﬁltration.
For the board review examination, it is most important to
be able to recognize the clinical scenario: for example, a history

Diagnosis

The diagnosis can be suspected endoscopically by ﬁnding concentric rings, linear ﬁssuring, or white plaque in the esophagus. These may occur in the proximal, middle, or distal
esophagus. Occasionally, abrupt ﬁssuring or cracking of the
esophageal mucosa is reported during endoscopy. Although
this can be alarming, it rarely is associated with true esophageal perforation. Rare cases have been reported of Boorhave’s
syndrome (spontaneous esophageal rupture) or dilatationinduced perforation. Radiographic ﬁndings also can include
concentric rings or so-called feline esophagus or tapered narrowing. The diagnosis is conﬁrmed by examination of four or
ﬁve biopsy samples from the esophagus. An increased number
of eosinophils (>15/high-powered ﬁeld) in the esophagus is
required for diagnosis.

Barrett’s Esophagus and Esophageal Cancer
Ganapathy A. Prasad, MD, MS

Deﬁnitionsa

Pathophysiology

Barrett’s esophagus is an acquired condition characterized by
the replacement of the squamous epithelium lining the esophagus by partially intestinalized columnar epithelium. It is
thought to be a complication of gastroesophageal reﬂux and
may reﬂect an adaptive response to reﬂux of gastric contents
into the esophagus. It is the strongest known risk factor for
esophageal adenocarcinoma, increasing the risk for this adenocarcinoma by 30- to 50-fold. Endoscopic and pathologic
criteria need to be met to make the diagnosis of Barrett’s
esophagus. Endoscopy must demonstrate columnar-appearing
mucosa in the tubular esophagus (Fig. 2.1), and biopsy specimens must show intestinal metaplasia with goblet cells (specialized intestinal metaplasia) (Fig. 2.2). This is based on
evidence that columnar metaplasia with goblet cells in the
esophagus is associated with an increased risk of progression
to esophageal adenocarcinoma.
Barrett’s esophagus is characterized by proximal displacement of the squamocolumnar junction in the esophagus and
has been classiﬁed into long-segment Barrett’s esophagus (visible
columnar mucosa in the esophagus of 3 cm or more) and shortsegment Barrett’s esophagus (visible columnar mucosa in the
esophagus less than 3 cm in length). Intestinal metaplasia of the
cardia refers to the histologic ﬁnding of intestinal metaplasia
with goblet cells at a normally located and normal-appearing
squamocolumnar junction (Fig. 2.3). This distinction is crucial
because intestinal metaplasia of the cardia or the gastroesophageal junction probably is not associated with an increased risk
for the development of esophageal adenocarcinoma. Given this
distinction, it is recommended that a normal-appearing and
normally located squamocolumnar junction not be biopsied.

Barrett’s esophagus is thought to be a consequence of chronic
reﬂux of gastric contents into the distal esophagus. From 5%
to 15% of subjects with chronic gastroesophageal reﬂux symptoms have evidence of Barrett’s esophagus on endoscopy.
Patients with Barrett’s esophagus have longer durations of
esophageal acid exposure, larger hiatal hernias, decreased
lower esophageal sphincter pressures, evidence of decreased
esophageal motility, and decreased esophageal sensitivity to
acid reﬂux compared with subjects without gastroesophageal
reﬂux and those with gastroesophageal reﬂux but without
Barrett’s esophagus. Control of acid reﬂux (when documented
with ambulatory pH studies) in patients with Barrett’s esophagus is more difﬁcult than in patients without Barrett’s esophagus. Resolution of symptoms (of acid reﬂux) correlates
poorly with control of acid reﬂux in patients with Barrett’s
esophagus. Persistent acid reﬂux (documented with 24-hour
pH studies) has been shown in 26% to 40% of patients with
Barrett’s esophagus who are asymptomatic while receiving
proton pump inhibitor therapy. Predictors of persistent acid
reﬂux despite symptom control in patients with Barrett’s
esophagus are not known.

Epidemiology

An autopsy study from Olmsted County, Minnesota, published in 1990 documented that the prevalence of longsegment Barrett’s esophagus in Olmsted County was
376 cases per 100,000 population. This study also highlighted
that the prevalence of long-segment Barrett’s esophagus
when assessed by autopsy was almost 20-fold the prevalence
when assessed by clinically indicated endoscopy (22 cases
per 100,000 population), indicating that perhaps a large
majority of cases of Barrett’s esophagus in the community
remain undiagnosed.

metaplasia) was reported in 16, a prevalence of 1.6%. Of note,
the prevalence of Barrett’s esophagus in those with (2.3%) and
without symptomatic reﬂux (1.8%) was not statistically different. In a second study performed in Italy, 1,033 subjects with
and without reﬂux symptoms had endoscopy and 1.3% were
found to have Barrett’s esophagus. The generalizability of
these study estimates to the United States is not clear. The two
studies may have underestimated the prevalence of Barrett’s
esophagus, because of the low rate of conﬁrmation of intestinal metaplasia in patients with endoscopically suspected Barrett’s esophagus; this may have been due to differences in the
number and size of biopsy specimens taken. In addition, the
threshold of the length of suspected Barrett’s esophagus for
biopsy acquisition was not speciﬁed. The population studied
was younger, with a higher prevalence of Helicobacter pylori
infection (37%) and a lower prevalence of obesity (only 16%
had a body mass index >30), than the US population.
The incidence of the diagnosis of Barrett’s esophagus has
been reported by different studies to be increasing. Whether
this is due to increasing endoscopy volume is a matter of
debate. A study from Olmsted County, Minnesota, showed a
parallel increase in the volume of endoscopies being performed (Fig. 2.4), whereas a study from Europe showed that
the increase in the incidence persisted even after adjusting for
endoscopy volume.

Risk Factors
Age

Data from two recent population-based studies from
Europe have shed additional light on the population prevalence of Barrett’s esophagus. In a Swedish study, endoscopy
was performed on 1,000 subjects living in two counties and

Barrett’s esophagus is an acquired disorder. The prevalence of
long-segment Barrett’s esophagus increases with age, particularly so after the ﬁfth decade. The mean age at the time of
clinical diagnosis was 63 years in one population-based study.
Long-segment Barrett’s esophagus is rare in children.

Male Sex

Barrett’s esophagus is more prevalent among males than
females. In a Mayo Clinic study of patients who had endoscopy between 1976 and 1989, long-segment Barrett’s esophagus was twice as common in males as in females. This has been

corroborated in other studies as well. In a large multicenter
Italian study (patients enrolled from 1987 to 1989), Barrett’s
esophagus was 2.6 times more common in males than in
females. In the 2005 Swedish population-based study, the
male-to-female ratio of biopsy-proven Barrett’s esophagus
was 1.5:1.

22

Section I Esophagus

Geography and Ethnicity

Barrett’s esophagus has been described frequently in Western
countries (North America, Europe, and Australia) but appears
to be less common in other countries, such as Japan. However,
recent reports from China, Singapore, and other Asian countries have appeared. In a recent single-center US retrospective
cross-sectional cohort study of 2,100 people (37.7% white,
11.8% black, 22.2% Hispanic) who had endoscopy from 2005
to 2006, whites (6.1%) were more likely to have Barrett’s
esophagus of any length than blacks (1.6%, P=.004) or
Hispanics (1.7%, P=.0002).
Reﬂux Symptoms

Barrett’s esophagus has been described in 2% to 20% of subjects with symptoms of gastroesophageal reﬂux (higher estimates in referral center studies and lower estimates in
population-based studies). The duration of reﬂux symptoms
(more than 5–10 years compared with shorter durations)
appears to predict the presence of Barrett’s esophagus better
than the severity or frequency of symptoms. Short-segment
Barrett’s esophagus is twice as prevalent as long-segment
Barrett’s esophagus in subjects with reﬂux symptoms.
However, it is important to note that a substantial proportion
of subjects with Barrett’s esophagus (as many as 40%–50%)
do not have frequent symptoms of gastroesophageal reﬂux.
Obesity

The association of body mass index with Barrett’s esophagus
has been investigated by multiple authors, but the results have
been conﬂicting (some studies have shown an association with
increased body mass index and others have not). A systematic
review clariﬁed this: body mass index was not signiﬁcantly different between patients with Barrett’s esophagus and those
with gastroesophageal reﬂux disease controls, but it was higher
in subjects with Barrett’s esophagus than in normal controls.
This led the authors to conclude that increased body mass
index may contribute to an increased risk of Barrett’s esophagus by causing increased gastroesophageal reﬂux, but may not
increase the risk of Barrett’s esophagus in subjects with gastroesophageal reﬂux disease. In addition, the strong male and
white predominance of Barrett’s esophagus and esophageal
carcinoma is not explained by increasing obesity (as measured
by the body mass index), which afﬂicts both sexes and all
ethnic groups.
Visceral adiposity (in contrast to body mass index as
a measure of overall adiposity) may provide a better explanation for the male and white predilection of Barrett’s esophagus. The distribution of body fat is more visceral than truncal
in high-risk groups (males and whites) for Barrett’s esophagus, as compared with females and African-Americans. Also,
abdominal diameter (independent of body mass index)
is associated with symptoms of gastroesophageal reﬂux in
whites but not in African-Americans or Asians. Multiple groups

of authors have reported an association between visceral adiposity (measured by waist circumference) and Barrett’s esophagus. A population-based case control study found an
association between increased waist circumference and the
diagnosis of Barrett’s esophagus, independent of body mass
index (odds ratio 2.24) when compared with population controls. This study reported a threshold of more than 80 cm of
waist circumference for the increased risk. The study did not
ﬁnd any association between body mass index and Barrett’s
esophagus. Another clinic-based case control study reported
that increased waist-hip ratio, a measure of central adiposity,
was associated with the diagnosis of Barrett’s esophagus (odds
ratio 2.8). The association between body mass index and Barrett’s esophagus was attenuated when both waist-hip ratio and
body mass index were modelled together. This association is
strengthened further by studies that found abdominal obesity
(measured by waist circumference) is associated with increased
postprandial intragastric pressure, disruption of the gastroesophageal junction (leading to the formation of hiatal hernia),
and increased transient lower esophageal sphincter relaxations
in the postprandial state.
Family History

Familial aggregation of Barrett’s esophagus and esophageal
adenocarcinoma has been reported in multiple studies. Studies
have reported the presence of conﬁrmed Barrett’s esophagus
or esophageal adenocarcinoma in ﬁrst- or second-degree relatives in 7% of probands with Barrett’s esophagus or esophageal adenocarcinoma. Increased prevalence of reﬂux symptoms
in relatives of probands with Barrett’s esophagus or esophageal adenocarcinoma has been reported, although data on
increased risk of Barrett’s esophagus in relatives of probands
with Barrett’s esophagus is not deﬁnitive. It is likely that
Barrett’s esophagus is a complex genetic disease inﬂuenced by
environmental factors. Research into identifying gene loci that
may inﬂuence the risk of the development of Barrett’s esophagus is continuing.

Intestinal Metaplasia of the Cardia or
Gastroesophageal Junction

The prevalence of intestinal metaplasia of the gastroesophageal junction has been reported in different studies to range
from 6% to 10%. The demographic characteristics of this
group of subjects appears to be different from the group with
Barrett’s esophagus, with a lower prevalence of reﬂux symptoms, no evidence of male predominance, and a higher prevalence of H pylori infection. Also, the prevalence of dysplasia
among subjects with intestinal metaplasia of the gastroesophageal junction has been reported to be lower than that among
subjects with Barrett’s esophagus. The natural history of
subjects with intestinal metaplasia of the gastroesophageal
junction is not well studied, but a small single-center study
showed no progression to high-grade dysplasia or esophageal

2 Barrett’s Esophagus and Esophageal Cancer

adenocarcinoma. However, because intestinal metaplasia is
more common than Barrett’s esophagus, it is likely that the
rate of progression to esophageal adenocarcinoma would be
much lower than for subjects with Barrett’s esophagus.

Cancer Risk

Multiple recent meta-analyses have shown consistently that
the rate of progression to esophageal adenocarcinoma in the
absence of prevalent dysplasia is low (5–6 cases/1,000 patientyears of follow-up). Data from these studies are summarized
in Table 2.1. The risk of progression in subjects with low-grade
dysplasia is debated, with estimates ranging from 0.6% to
1.2% per year. A recent meta-analysis reported that the rate of
progression to esophageal adenocarcinoma in subjects with
low-grade dysplasia was 16.98/1,000 person-years compared
with 5.98/1,000 person-years for subjects with no dysplasia,
although there was signiﬁcant heterogeneity between the
studies. The rate of progression in subjects with high-grade
dysplasia is the highest, with estimates of 65.8/1,000 patientyears of follow-up.

diagnosed after the onset of symptoms. However, arguments
against screening include the poor accuracy of symptomatic
gastroesophageal reﬂux in predicting or excluding the absence
of Barrett’s esophagus on endoscopy, the challenges with surveillance, and the lack of strong prospective evidence that
screening and surveillance may improve survival of subjects
with esophageal adenocarcinoma. Endoscopic evaluation of
subjects thought to be at high risk for Barrett’s esophagus may
be considered on an individual basis after discussing the pros
and cons with the patient.

Surveillance

In contrast to screening, surveillance of subjects with known
Barrett’s esophagus is endorsed by all major gastrointestinal
societies. The goal of surveillance is the early detection of progression so that therapeutic intervention may be applied to
improve patient outcomes. Surveillance has a number of limitations that include, but are not limited to, the following:
1. Poor interobserver agreement between pathologists on
identifying the grade of dysplasia (particularly low-grade
dysplasia).
2. Variable natural predictive value of dysplasia, with variable progression rates reported by different cohorts for
the same grade of dysplasia.
3. The patchy distribution of advanced dysplasia, making
sampling error likely during surveillance.

Screening

Screening for Barrett’s esophagus in subjects with symptomatic gastroesophageal reﬂux or in the general population is a
matter of controversy with lukewarm support from major gastrointestinal societies. Arguments in favor of screening include
the large number of cases of Barrett’s esophagus in the community that are undiagnosed and the progression of Barrett’s
esophagus from gastroesophageal reﬂux to metaplasia, dysplasia, and adenocarcinoma (which can be detected at an early
stage with a screening and surveillance program). Furthermore,
retrospective studies have found that adenocarcinomas diagnosed in surveillance programs were earlier stage and associated with improved survival compared with adenocarcinomas

23

Despite these limitations, the grade of dysplasia (no dysplasia, low-grade dysplasia, or high-grade dysplasia) is the primary clinical risk stratiﬁcation tool. Subjects with long-segment
Barrett’s esophagus and those with short-segment Barrett’s
esophagus both are recommended to undergo similar surveillance because the primary predictor of progression is the grade
of dysplasia and there is no deﬁnitive evidence that the length
of the segment of Barrett’s esophagus is an independent predictor of progression.

Section I Esophagus

Before surveillance is undertaken, the pros and cons of
surveillance should be discussed with the patient. Surveillance
should be offered to patients with reasonable life expectancy
so that therapy for progression (if detected) may be tolerated
and would beneﬁt the patient. Optimization of the acidsuppressive regimen titrated to control symptoms and to heal
esophagitis should be undertaken to minimize confounding
the interpretation of dysplasia grade by reactive atypia (which
can occur from inﬂammation caused by uncontrolled reﬂux).
Low-grade dysplasia and high-grade dysplasia should be
conﬁrmed by gastrointestinal pathologists, because there is
discrepancy between community and academic pathologists
in grading dysplasia and there is evidence that the risk of
progression in those with conﬁrmed low-grade dysplasia (by
expert pathologists) may be higher.
It is recommended that surveillance biopsies be performed
after careful inspection of the segment of Barrett’s esophagus
with high-resolution endoscopy to identify any visible lesions
that may indicate a higher grade of dysplasia. The use of
narrow-band imaging or other imaging techniques that
enhance superﬁcial mucosal and vascular patterns (Fig. 2.1B)
may improve detection rates of focal abnormalities (such as
nodules and ulcers) and advanced dysplasia. These areas
should be biopsied separately and sent for histopathology
study in speciﬁcally labeled bottles. The remaining Barrett’s
mucosa should be biopsied in a 4-quadrant manner every
2 cm, with tissue being submitted in separate bottles at each
2-cm level. For patients with high-grade dysplasia, surveillance should be performed every 1 cm in a 4-quadrant fashion
to exclude prevalent carcinoma.
No Dysplasia and Low-Grade Dysplasia

Patients with no dysplasia should be reevaluated within
12 months to exclude prevalent dysplasia and subsequently
assessed every 3 to 5 years. Patients with low-grade dysplasia
(Fig. 2.5) should be reassessed within 6 months to exclude
prevalent dysplasia, followed by annual surveillance. If no dysplasia is detected in two successive years, the surveillance
schedule can be changed to follow the “no dysplasia” intervals.
The natural history of subjects who have low-grade dysplasia
is characterized, in the majority of them, by reversion to no
dysplasia or stability at low-grade dysplasia.
High-Grade Dysplasia

If high-grade dysplasia (Fig. 2.6) is detected, it should be conﬁrmed by an expert gastrointestinal pathologist because therapeutic decisions may need to be made on the basis of the
conﬁrmation. Of note, in a multicenter randomized study for
photodynamic therapy, the diagnosis of high-grade dysplasia
made by a community pathologist was overruled by an expert
pathologist in two-thirds of cases.
Diagnosis should be followed in 3 months by careful
endoscopic evaluation, with the use of high-resolution or
high-deﬁnition endoscopes (with dye-based or virtual chro-

moendoscopy, using techniques such as narrow-band imaging), to assess for the presence of any visual abnormality. Also,
endoscopic ultrasonography usually is performed to exclude
the presence of a coexisting invasive neoplasm (which may be
present in 10% to 12% of patients treated with esophagectomy). Any visible lesion should be removed by endoscopic
mucosal resection (EMR).
With EMR, a submucosal injection is used to lift a mucosal
lesion that is then resected by using either a plastic cap with a
snare (EMR-cap) or with band ligation followed by snare excision (EMR-ligation). The technique allows precise staging of
the depth of invasion into the mucosa or submucosa (with
better interobserver agreement between pathologists in grading dysplasia than biopsies) and the assessment of margins,
and it may be therapeutic if lateral and deep margins are clear
(Fig. 2.7). Studies have shown that EMR of visible lesions may

show that the grade of dysplasia is higher in as many as 30% of
patients with high-grade dysplasia.
Options for the management of high-grade dysplasia can
be divided into three approaches:

Figure 2.7 Endoscopic mucosal resection specimen. This technique

enables visualization of the mucosa, lamina propria, muscularis
mucosa, and submucosa, thus allowing an accurate determination
of the depth of invasion of malignant lesions. (Hematoxylin-eosin;
original magniﬁcation, ×12.5.)

1. Esophagectomy: This involves removing the segment of
the esophagus involved by Barrett’s esophagus and performing an esophagogastric anastomosis. It is associated
with a 30-day mortality rate of 2% to 5% in high-volume
centers (higher rates in lower volume centers) and morbidity rates of 30% to 50% (including postoperative complications, eg, cardiac and pulmonary complications).
2. Endoscopic therapy: Options include additional EMR to
remove any visible lesions, followed by ablation of the
remaining segment of Barrett’s esophagus. Ablation is
based on the concept that destruction of the metaplastic
mucosa, followed by control of reﬂux, leads to regrowth
of squamous epithelium.
Other treatment options include the following:
a. Photodynamic therapy has been shown in a randomized controlled trial to be superior to surveillance in

Section I Esophagus

eradicating high-grade dysplasia and decreasing the
risk of progression to adenocarcinoma. The 5-year
overall survival rate of patients receiving photodynamic therapy and those undergoing esophagectomy
was shown in a nonrandomized study to be comparable. Photodynamic therapy makes the patients
intensely photosensitive and is associated with a high
rate (36%) of stricture formation.
b. Radiofrequency ablation: This involves the use of
heat energy that is delivered with balloon-based catheters to destroy nondysplastic and dysplastic mucosa
of Barrett’s esophagus. In a randomized controlled
trial, radiofrequency ablation was found to be superior to sham ablation in eliminating dysplasia and
metaplasia at 1 year. The technique is associated with
a lower stricture rate and decreased postprocedure
morbidity than with photodynamic therapy. Longterm data on durability of response are awaited.
Other techniques such as cryotherapy, which
involves the use of cryogens (liquid nitrogen and
carbon dioxide) to damage the metaplastic mucosa,
are being studied as alternatives.
3. Endoscopic surveillance: This involves careful endoscopic evaluation every 3 months, with surveillance
biopsy samples taken at every centimeter along the segment of Barrett’s esophagus, with additional endoscopic
mucosal resection if a focal abnormality is visualized.
The choice of treatment of high-grade dysplasia depends
on the expertise available at the treatment center: endoscopic
vs surgical, the choice of the patient, balancing the fear of
cancer being missed or recurring (favoring surgery) vs the fear
of morbid surgery affecting the quality of life (favoring endoscopic therapy), the ability to adhere to a long schedule of frequent endoscopic assessment in endoscopic therapy, and the
overall comorbid status and life expectancy of the patient
(high vs low comorbid score).

Esophageal Cancer
Epidemiology

Squamous cell carcinoma (Fig. 2.8A) and adenocarcinoma
(Fig. 2.8B) are the most common types of esophageal cancer.
Esophageal carcinoma is the seventh leading cause of death in
the world. Throughout the world, squamous cell carcinoma
accounts for most cases of esophageal cancer and is more
common in Asia and the developing world, with esophageal
adenocarcinoma being more common in the Western world.
In the United States, approximately 16,000 cases of esophageal carcinoma are diagnosed annually, with the proportion of
esophageal adenocarcinoma increasing to more than 50%
over the last decade. The incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma in the United States has been increasing exponentially
over the past 3 decades (1.0 new case/100,000 persons per year

in the 1970s to 5.69 new cases/100,000 persons per year in
2004 for white males and from 0.17 new case/100,000 persons
per year in the 1970s to 0.70 new case/100,000 persons per
year in 2004 for white females). However, the incidence of
squamous cell carcinoma in the United States has decreased
from 3.8 new cases/100,000 persons per year in the 1970s
to 1.90 new cases/100,000 persons per year in 2004 for white
males, with a similar trend for white females. In contrast,
in certain regions of China and Iran, squamous cell carcinoma
is exceedingly common, occurring in 132/100,000 persons
per year.
Overall, neoplasms of the esophagus carry a poor prognosis, particularly if diagnosed after the onset of symptoms. In
the United States, the number of deaths from esophageal carcinoma closely approximates the number for new cases per
year and the overall 5-year survival rate is less than 20%.

2 Barrett’s Esophagus and Esophageal Cancer

Risk Factors for Squamous Cell Carcinoma

Geographic—The incidence rates for squamous cell carcinoma
in the United States are higher in urban areas and areas with
lower socioeconomic development. As mentioned above, incidence rates are higher in parts of Asia (China, India, and Iran).
This may be inﬂuenced by dietary and environmental issues.
Dietary—Foods with N-nitroso compounds (which can
cause DNA damage); Betel nut chewing; selenium, zinc, vitamin C, and folate deﬁciency; and intake of hot liquids are
known risk factors.
Preexisting esophageal diseases—Lye-induced strictures
and achalasia are recognized risk factors.
Other systemic diseases—Tylosis
Smoking and alcohol consumption—The risk for squamous
cell carcinoma increases with increasing use of tobacco and
alcohol.
Risk Factors for Adenocarcinoma

The risk factors for esophageal adenocarcinoma mirror the
risk factors for Barrett’s esophagus, and Barrett’s esophagus is
the strongest risk factor for esophageal adenocarcinoma.
Established risk factors for esophageal adenocarcinoma are
advancing age, male sex, chronic reﬂux of gastric contents,
white ethnicity, and obesity (particularly central or male pattern obesity). Heartburn and acid regurgitation, especially if
present for more than 12 years, are also risk factors. It is
important to note that as many as 40% to 50% of patients who
have esophageal adenocarcinoma say they do not have symptoms of frequent gastroesophageal reﬂux. Debate continues
on the role of H pylori infection in the increasing incidence of
esophageal adenocarcinoma. Some reports suggest an inverse
correlation (based on atrophic gastritis from H pylori infection decreasing gastric acid output and, hence, decreasing
reﬂux of gastric contents and protecting against esophageal
adenocarcinoma) and other studies do not.

conﬁrm a diagnosis is obtained best from endoscopy. After
histologic conﬁrmation of the diagnosis, attention should be
directed at staging.
The goal of staging is to classify the tumor as early or localized to the esophagus, locally advanced, or metastatic. Tools
available for staging include positron emission tomography
(PET), which is best suited and most sensitive for detecting
distant metastatic disease. It has greater sensitivity than computed tomography (CT), detecting unsuspected metastatic
disease in 10% to 15% of cases considered negative on CT
study. The use of PET has been shown to lead to a change in
management in 10% to 20% of patients. However, PET is
expensive and may not be widely available. CT usually is performed ﬁrst to exclude metastatic disease, followed by PET (if
available) to exclude any metastatic lesions missed with CT.
Endoscopic ultrasonography is used to perform locoregional
staging: assessing the T (tumor) stage (invasion into the
esophageal wall) and the N (nodal) stage. Endoscopic ultrasonography is most sensitive for staging locally advanced
(T2-3) disease, with modest accuracy for staging early (mucosal
or submucosal) disease, and for establishing the N stage (particularly with the use of ﬁne-needle aspiration of enlarged
lymph nodes). Metastatic involvement of celiac lymph nodes
is detected best with endoscopic ultrasonography. The current
TNM staging criteria for esophageal adenocarcinoma are
listed in Table 2.2.

Signs and Symptoms

The symptoms of esophageal cancer include progressive solid
food dysphagia that progresses to dysphagia to soft solids and
then liquids. Unintentional weight loss is commonly reported
with later-stage disease. Other than the skin changes of tylosis
or lichen planus in patients with squamous cell carcinoma,
there are no speciﬁc signs of esophageal cancer. In most
patients, the physical examination ﬁndings are normal. With
late-stage disease or disease of the proximal esophagus, supraclavicular lymphadenopathy or hepatomegaly can be palpated,
indicating the possibility of metastatic disease.
Diagnosis and Staging

Diagnosis of esophageal carcinoma requires endoscopy with
biopsy. Although the diagnosis may be suspected from the
results of a barium study or other imaging tests, tissue to

Section I Esophagus

In early stage disease (T1 N0 M0), endoscopic mucosal
resection is an accurate tool to distinguish between mucosally
conﬁned disease (T1a) and submucosally invasive disease
(T1b). This is an important distinction because endoscopic
therapy may be considered for T1a disease, given the low risk
of metastatic lymphadenopathy (<5%) as compared with submucosal disease, for which the risk of metastatic lymphadenopathy is 20% to 30% and the therapy of choice is
esophagectomy (which allows lymph node dissection and
removal).
Treatment options depend on the stage of the disease.
Endoscopic therapy (with endoscopic mucosal resection and
additional ablative techniques) may be considered for T1a disease; recent reports have documented excellent overall survival outcomes, in comparison with surgery, at 5 years. More
invasive disease is treated by esophagectomy with lymph node
dissection (T2 or N0 disease) or preoperative chemoradiotherapy, followed by restaging and esophagectomy (for T3 or
N1 disease). This treatment strategy is based on limited data
reporting a modest survival advantage with neoadjuvant
chemoradiotherapy in some studies comparing neoadjuvant
chemoradiotherapy followed by surgery to surgery alone.
Metastatic disease can be managed with a combination of palliative chemoradiotherapy, esophageal stent placement, and
nutritional support (administered orally with supplements or
with percutaneously placed enteric tubes).

Normal and Abnormal Esophageal Motilitya
Dawn L. Francis, MD, MHS

The esophagus has two major functions: to propel food boluses
downward to the stomach and to keep stomach contents from
reﬂuxing upward. The esophagus accomplishes these functions by its tubular anatomy and motility that involves the
contraction and relaxation of sphincter muscles and precisely
timed peristaltic waves. When these functions go awry, the
most common symptoms are dysphagia and gastroesophageal
reﬂux disease. This chapter focuses primarily on how the food
bolus is handled by the esophagus.

Anatomya

The upper esophagus is shaped like a cone, in which the
elastic pharynx joins the mouth to the esophagus and trachea.
The upper one-third of the esophagus has a squamous cell
mucosa. Its muscular layer is striated muscle. At the entry of
the esophagus from the posterior pharynx is a sphincter, the
upper esophageal sphincter (UES), consisting of the cricopharyngeus muscle (predominately), the cervical esophagus, and
the inferior pharyngeal constrictor. At rest, the UES is constricted, keeping esophageal contents from coming up into the
posterior oropharynx, mouth, and airway.
The esophagus is a neuromuscular tube with an inner circular layer of muscle and an outer longitudinal layer of muscle.
At the level of the aortic arch, approximately one-third the
way down the esophagus, the striated muscle transitions to
smooth muscle. This is known as the transition zone. The lower
one-half of the esophagus consists entirely of smooth muscle.
At the esophagogastric junction is a ring of thickened smooth

esophageal sphincter; UES, upper esophageal sphincter

muscle, the lower esophageal sphincter (LES). Like the UES, the
LES is contracted at rest, keeping gastric contents from reﬂuxing into the esophagus.
Normal Swallowing

This initial process of swallowing is under voluntary control.
A swallow is initiated by the lips closing, the teeth clenching,
and the tongue being elevated against the palate, forcing the
bolus to the pharynx. Entry of the bolus into the pharynx triggers the involuntary swallowing reﬂex. This reﬂex involves
elevation of the soft palate against the posterior pharyngeal
wall to seal the oropharynx and nasopharynx and elevation of
the larynx to close the laryngeal inlet and prevent aspiration.
The long axis of the pharynx shortens, removing the recesses
formed by the piriform sinuses, valleculae, and laryngeal
vestibule. Passage of the bolus stimulates peristaltic contraction of the pharyngeal muscles. As the peristaltic contraction
approaches the cricopharyngeus muscle, the muscle relaxes
and the larynx is elevated, actively pulling open the UES. As
the contraction passes, the UES closes tightly. As the UES
opens, a peristaltic wave in the esophageal body pushes the
food bolus forward. The LES relaxes when the UES opens and
remains relaxed until the bolus has entered the stomach.
Relaxation of the LES occurs through the release of nitric
oxide from myenteric neurons that innervate the LES. Myenteric neurons are important also in maintaining the resting
basal tone of the upper esophagus. Peristaltic contractions are
under local control of the myenteric plexus. In this process,
acetylcholine has an excitatory effect and nitric oxide has an
inhibitory effect.
The smooth muscle of the esophagus is innervated by axons
of cranial nerve X (the vagus nerve) that originate in the dorsal
motor nucleus of the vagus and synapse on myenteric plexus
neurons in the esophagus. The striated muscle of the pharynx,
the UES, and striated muscle in the proximal esophagus are
29

innervated by cranial nerves IX (glossopharyngeal nerve)
and X.

Swallowing Dysfunction
Oropharyngeal Swallowing Disorders

Oropharyngeal dysphagia is often characterized by the complaint of difﬁculty initiating a swallow, transitioning the food
bolus or liquid into the esophagus, meal-induced coughing or
“choking,” or of food “getting stuck” in the voluntary phase of
swallowing. The patient often localizes the sensation to the
cervical esophagus above the suprasternal notch.
Many disorders cause oropharyngeal dysphagia (Table 3.1).
Generally, these include neuromuscular diseases, systemic diseases, and mechanical obstruction. When neuromuscular diseases cause oropharyngeal dysphagia, other neurologic or
muscular symptoms may be present, including recurrent
bouts of aspiration pneumonia from inadequate airway protection, hoarseness, dysarthria, or pharyngonasal regurgitation. Oropharyngeal dysphagia can be caused also by
mechanical or anatomical abnormalities such as cervical
osteophytes, thyromegaly, pharyngeal tonsillar enlargement,
a cricopharyngeal bar (also known as hypertensive UES),
or Zenker’s diverticulum.
The best investigation to evaluate oropharyngeal dysphagia
is a videoﬂuoroscopic swallowing study in the presence of a
swallowing expert. This test allows thorough evaluation of the
ﬁrst portion of a swallow. It also can determine whether the

problem is functional or anatomical and can target treatment.
Speciﬁcally, the following functions are evaluated:
Tongue coordination—An uncoordinated tongue impairs
transmission of the bolus.
Soft palate elevation—Dysfunction of the soft palate can
lead to nasopharyngeal regurgitation.
Laryngeal closure—Failure of laryngeal closure can lead to
aspiration.
Pharyngeal peristalsis—Poor pharyngeal peristalsis results
in residue in the valleculae or piriform sinuses.
The primary treatment for oropharyngeal dysphagia is
swallowing rehabilitation by a swallowing professional (in
most cases, a speech pathologist). Swallowing rehabilitation
beneﬁts most patients who have oropharyngeal dysphagia. In
addition to swallowing rehabilitation, any patient with
oropharyngeal dysphagia should be cautioned to chew food
thoroughly and slowly and to avoid alcohol during meals.
Consuming food quickly and without focused attention can
easily lead to aspiration, the most important risk of oropharyngeal dysphagia.
There are a number of maneuvers performed during swallowing that may reduce oropharyngeal dysphagia, and these
can be tailored to target a speciﬁc defect. Some authors think
that swallowing rehabilitation can improve oropharyngeal
dysphagia even when it is caused by an anatomical abnormality. This has been demonstrated in patients with defects due to
surgical resection of oropharyngeal tissue or caustic injury.
Patients who have oropharyngeal dysphagia due to an
anatomical abnormality such as Zenker’s diverticulum or cricopharyngeal bar typically require endoscopic or surgical
intervention. Bougie dilation has been used successfully in
some patients with oropharyngeal dysphagia caused by a
cricopharyngeal bar, hypertensive UES, or primary cricopharyngeal dysfunction. Injection of botulinum toxin at the
UES also has been effective for hypertensive UES or Zenker’s
diverticulum.
Patients with inadequate pharyngeal contraction or lack of
coordination between the hypopharynx and the UES, cricopharyngeal bar, hypertensive UES, or Zenker’s diverticulum
may be candidates for cricopharyngeal myotomy. The success
of myotomy depends on the patient having adequate neuromuscular function and radiographic evidence of obstruction
to bolus ﬂow at the level of the cricopharyngeus muscle or
manometric evidence of increased UES pressure, in comparison with that of the pharynx.
Pharmacologic intervention is available for patients with
oropharyngeal dysphagia caused by an underlying neurologic
disease that has effective medical therapy, such as myasthenia
gravis or Parkinson’s disease. However, many patients with
oropharyngeal dysphagia have an underlying disease that is
progressive and does not have any effective treatment option.
For these patients, swallowing rehabilitation may prolong the
time they can meet their nutritional needs orally, but ultimately many require nonoral feeding to prevent aspiration,
for example, with a percutaneous gastrostomy tube.

3 Normal and Abnormal Esophageal Motility

Esophageal Body Disorders

Patients with an esophageal body or LES disorder describe
“esophageal dysphagia” characterized by the onset of symptoms moments after the initiation of a swallow. They usually
can sense that the food or liquid bolus has traversed the oral
cavity and has entered the esophagus. They complain of food
feeling “stuck” or “hung up” in transition to the stomach.
They may feel symptoms are in the retrosternal area or near
the suprasternal notch. Retrosternal dysphagia usually corresponds to the location of the lesion, whereas suprasternal dysphagia is referred from below as much as 80% of the time.
Occasionally, esophageal dysphagia can be so profound that
patients describe dysphagia in addition to regurgitation
during, or just after, a meal.
Esophageal dysphagia can be caused by several diseases but
is most often the result of a mechanical obstruction or one of a
small number of motility disorders. Esophageal dysphagia
caused by a motility disorder is commonly characterized by
dysphagia to both solids and liquids. Dysphagia associated with
only solid foods is more likely due to a mechanical obstruction,
although a mechanical obstruction may progress to the extent
that there is dysphagia for both solids and liquids.
Episodic and nonprogressive dysphagia without weight
loss usually is due to an esophageal web or distal esophageal
ring. If solid food dysphagia is progressive, the problem may
be an esophageal stricture, carcinoma of the esophagus, or
achalasia. When weight loss is present with solid food dysphagia, the most important concern is esophageal carcinoma.
Esophageal dysphagia is an alarm symptom and merits
investigation of the cause. A small number of tests are available to evaluate esophageal dysphagia: upper intestinal endoscopy, barium esophagram, and esophageal manometry. The
goal of testing is to identify structural or mucosal abnormalities that require intervention, to detect underlying systemic
disease, and to deﬁne functional disorders.
The choice of an initial test is based on the clinical presentation and the expertise available. Typically, a barium esophagram or upper endoscopy is the ﬁrst test. Barium esophagram
can be helpful to plan endoscopic therapy, if appropriate. For
example, if a Schatzki’s ring is identiﬁed, a plan can be made
for endoscopy with dilation. Many experts recommend that if
patients with esophageal dysphagia have no endoscopic evidence of mechanical obstruction, then esophageal biopsy
specimens should be obtained to rule out eosinophilic
esophagitis. If testing for eosinophilic esophagitis is negative,
most experts recommend proceeding to stationary esophageal
manometry (Fig. 3.1).

the LES. The LES is tonically closed at rest, with a normal mean
pressure between 10 and 45 mm Hg. At relaxation, the normal
residual pressure of the LES is less than 8 mm Hg. The normal
average amplitude of the distal wave is 30 to 220 mm Hg.
Classiﬁcation of Esophageal
Motility Disorders

Esophageal motility disorders generally are classiﬁed as achalasia or nonspeciﬁc esophageal dysmotility. The three subtypes
of nonspeciﬁc esophageal dysmotility are hypercontractile and
hypotensive esophagus disorders and discoordinated motility.
Nutcracker esophagus and hypertensive LES are within the
category of hypercontractile esophagus disorder, whereas ineffective esophageal motility and hypotensive LES are in the
hypotensive esophagus disorder category. Diffuse esophageal
spasm is a discoordinated motility disorder. All these esophageal motility disorders have diagnostic criteria (Table 3.2).
Achalasia

Esophageal Motility Disorders

Disorders of esophageal motility are diagnosed with stationary
esophageal manometry. An example of a normal manometric
recording of primary peristalsis is shown in Figure 3.2. With a
liquid bolus, the esophageal body peristaltic wave moves at a
rate of 2 to 8 cm per second, followed by complete relaxation of

Of all esophageal motility disorders, achalasia is the most
important to diagnose and treat because failure to do so can
result in signiﬁcant patient morbidity. Achalasia is loss of peristalsis of the esophageal body and failure of relaxation of the
LES. Achalasia is rare, with most studies reporting an incidence of 1/100,000 persons and prevalence of 10/100,000.

Medications are typically ineffective and poorly tolerated in achalasia. Most authors do not recommend medical treatment for achalasia.

Increased resting pressure is not required for diagnosis of achalasia; as many as 50% of patients have normal resting pressure. Absence of peristalsis and poorly relaxing LES are
required for diagnosis.

There is no gender or race predominance, and the disease can
occur at any age. The diagnosis of achalasia made before the
second decade is rare. The incidence increases with age, with
the highest incidence in the seventh decade.
Achalasia is best described as primary or secondary. Secondary achalasia has a cause that can be identiﬁed, but shares
many of the clinical features of primary achalasia. The most
common cause of secondary achalasia worldwide is an infection by Trypanosoma cruzi (a species found in Central and
South America) known as Chagas’ disease. This infection also
affects other organs and can cause megacolon, heart disease,
and neurologic disorders.
Other causes of secondary achalasia are inﬁltration or
obstruction of the LES by systemic disease or direct invasion
by tumor, amyloid, peripheral neuropathy, or central nervous
system disorders. Secondary achalasia can be iatrogenic, most
commonly from incorrectly constructed fundoplication
during antireﬂux procedures. Secondary achalasia has been
reported also with laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding.
Pathology

The most striking pathologic characteristic of achalasia is the
degeneration of ganglion cells in the myenteric plexus of the
esophageal body and LES. Immunohistochemical techniques
show that the loss of ganglion cells is in association with lymphocytic inﬁltration, which has led to the proposition that the
cause of the condition is autoimmune or viral immune.
The cause of ganglion cell degeneration in achalasia has
been investigated, but a clear etiology has not been deﬁned.
An inﬂammatory reaction induced by viral infection has been
studied with measles, herpesvirus, varicella zoster, poliovirus,
and human papillomavirus, with inconsistent results among
studies. The role of an autoimmune process has been studied
as a potential cause. Most investigators have focused on the
association of speciﬁc HLA classes with achalasia. Potential
associations have been shown with class II HLA DQw1. There
is evidence of myenteric antiplexus antibodies with speciﬁc
HLA genotypes. Of note, a recent case-control study examined the serum from 70 patients with primary achalasia and
found a higher prevalence of neural autoantibodies in patients
than in controls. Because the study of the role of autoimmunity in gastrointestinal motility disease is recent, it is possible
that an autoantibody which causes primary achalasia has yet
to be discovered.
Diagnosis

Patients who have a symptom complex that suggests achalasia
typically require at least two, and sometimes three, studies for
diagnosis. Barium esophagram is often the ﬁrst study performed
for patients with dysphagia. In achalasia, this study shows a
dilated esophagus, absence of peristalsis, and narrowing of the
distal esophagus in a typical bird’s beak appearance (Fig. 3.3).
Endoscopic evaluation of the esophagus and stomach is
recommended for every patient with achalasia to ensure that

radiographic or manometric ﬁndings are due to achalasia
rather than to an obstructive disorder that can have a similar
manometric or radiographic appearance, most importantly, a
tumor of the distal esophagus. Normal esophagogastroduodenoscopic (EGD) results should not dissuade a clinician from
making the diagnosis of achalasia, because up to 40% of
patients with this disease have normal ﬁndings on endoscopy.
Esophageal manometry is considered the “gold standard”
test for achalasia. Classic achalasia is deﬁned by the absence of
peristalsis in the esophageal body, a hypertensive LES (resting
pressure >45 mm Hg), and a poorly relaxing LES, with a residual pressure more than 8 mm Hg. However, it is well understood that as many as 50% of patients with the clinical
diagnosis of achalasia do not have a hypertensive LES; however, the diagnosis does require aperistalsis and a poorly relaxing LES (Fig. 3.4). Recent studies have attempted to subclassify
achalasia on the basis of ﬁndings of high-resolution manometry. It is unclear whether these proposed classiﬁcations are

relevant to clinical response; as yet, they have not been adopted
widely in clinical practice.
Treatment

Treatment of achalasia aims at relaxation or mechanical disruption of the LES. Because of the rarity of achalasia, few randomized controlled trials have deﬁned the best treatment
strategy. Several medications have been used in the treatment
of achalasia, including nitrates, calcium channel blockers, and
nitric oxide donors (sildenaﬁl), in an attempt to either facilitate LES relaxation or augment esophageal peristalsis (or
both). Adverse effects and lack of efﬁcacy have limited the
common use of these medications for achalasia.
Injection of botulinum toxin into the LES is an appealing
strategy because it is safe and noninvasive. Studies have shown
this treatment to provide excellent short-term symptomatic
improvement. However, repeated injections are usually
required because of the short-term activity of botulinum
toxin. This is complicated further by the development of antibodies that makes repeated injections increasingly ineffective.
Also, there is evidence that injection of botulinum toxin into
the LES is associated with increased difﬁculty in performing
esophagomyotomy at a later time. For this reason, many clinicians reserve the use of botulinum toxin for patients who are
of extreme advanced age or who have severe comorbidities
that preclude treatment with pneumatic balloon dilation or
esophagomyotomy because of the associated risks.
Dilation of the LES in patients with achalasia should be
directed at fracturing the muscularis propria. Bougienage or

standard balloon dilation typically is ineffective for achalasia,
but pneumatic balloon dilation with a rigid balloon across the
LES has been shown to be effective and inexpensive. The
primary drawbacks of pneumatic dilation are the risk of
esophageal perforation (between 2% and 6%) and lack of
durability, as compared with surgical treatment, according to
most studies.
Esophagomyotomy or Heller myotomy cuts the LES
directly. A longitudinal incision is initiated on the gastric side
approximately 2 cm distal to the gastroesophageal junction
and extended proximally 7 cm above the junction. Over the
past 20 years, this procedure has been performed safely and
successfully with laparoscopy. Long-term studies (10 years of
follow-up) have shown that surgical myotomy produces
symptomatic relief in 80% to 85% of patients.
Nearly 50% of patients who have a modiﬁed Heller myotomy develop gastroesophageal reﬂux disease, with some
developing erosive esophagitis, stricture, and Barrett’s esophagus. A prospective randomized clinical trial of myotomy with
and without Dor (or anterior) fundoplication showed that
patients with the Dor procedure had much less gastroesophageal reﬂux, as assessed with 24-hour esophageal pH testing,
than those without fundoplication (9% vs 48%). This has
led to the common practice in most centers of coupling the
modiﬁed Heller myotomy with fundoplication.
The role of pneumatic dilation in comparison with surgery
is still being evaluated. Only a single randomized prospective
trial has compared esophagomyotomy with pneumatic dilation. This study showed that the two treatments initially were
equally effective in relieving symptoms, but at follow-up,

3 Normal and Abnormal Esophageal Motility

patients who had esophagomyotomy had fewer recurrent
symptoms than those who had pneumatic dilation.
Several studies have reported long-term outcomes of
patients with achalasia. Overall, there is no difference in life
expectancy or mortality for patients with treated achalasia
than for the general population. However, there is clear evidence that patients with achalasia (treated or untreated) are at
increased risk for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. There
is no consensus about screening; however, most experts recommend endoscopy at least once in the decade following the
diagnosis of achalasia. Of importance, if new or worsening
dysphagia develops in a patient with achalasia, upper endoscopy should be performed.
Nonspeciﬁc Esophageal Dysmotility

explains why nitrates often provide beneﬁt in the treatment of
diffuse esophageal spasm.
The hallmark of diffuse esophageal spasm is the presence of
simultaneous contractions in more than 20% of swallows. There
must be at least one swallow with peristalsis (in distinction from
achalasia). Often, contractions are repetitive (≥3 peaks) and the
distal peristaltic duration is increased (>6 seconds) (Fig. 3.5).
Barium esophagram ﬁndings are variable in diffuse esophageal
spasm. Classically, severe tertiary contractions can produce a
“corkscrew” esophagus (Fig. 3.6). However, because the results
of radiographic studies may be normal in diffuse esophageal
spasm, a normal study does not rule out the diagnosis. The
diagnosis is made on the basis of clinical symptoms and manometric ﬁndings.
Nutcracker Esophagus

Hypercontractile Esophageal Disorders
Diffuse Esophageal Spasm

Diffuse esophageal spasm is likely a rare disease. The true prevalence is uncertain because it can be difﬁcult to diagnose. The
typical symptom complex for this condition is intermittent
chest pain (it may radiate to the back or throat) associated with
dysphagia. Nearly 10% of patients with noncardiac chest pain
or unexplained dysphagia have diffuse esophageal spasm. The
pathophysiology of the condition is poorly understood. Over
the past several decades, it has become clear that diffuse esophageal spasm is a misnomer, because the spastic component
affects only the smooth muscle in the distal two-thirds of the
esophagus. A small study of patients with diffuse esophageal
spasm has suggested there may be dysfunction in the endogenous synthesis or degradation of nitric oxide. This ﬁnding

The term nutcracker esophagus is used to describe the manometric ﬁnding of high-pressure peristaltic contractions in the
distal esophagus, with an average amplitude of pressure higher
than 220 mm Hg on 10 or more liquid swallows, with otherwise normal peristalsis. Nutcracker esophagus was ﬁrst
described more than 3 decades ago, and since that time, there
has been considerable controversy about the association of
this manometric ﬁnding with symptoms. In a study that examined the manometric ﬁndings from patients with unexplained
chest pain, nutcracker esophagus was the most common
abnormal ﬁnding, occurring in 12% of patients. Many patients
with the manometric ﬁnding of nutcracker esophagus do not
have chest pain. In an unpublished study at Mayo Clinic, 15%
of asymptomatic patients who received esophageal manometry before having 24-hour impedance pH testing met the
manometric criteria for nutcracker esophagus.

A study with 24-hour ambulatory esophageal manometry
found that patients who had nutcracker esophagus or diffuse
esophageal spasm according to stationary manometry frequently switch patterns over 24 hours, suggesting that nutcracker esophagus may be a marker for esophageal spasm.
With the use of high-frequency intraluminal ultrasonography
to examine patients who have nutcracker esophagus, asynchrony was found in the contractions of the circular and longitudinal muscle layers of the esophagus, and this was reversed
with atropine, suggesting that the manometric abnormality
may be due to a hypercholinergic state.
Hypertensive Lower Esophageal Sphincter

The manometric ﬁnding of a hypertensive LES (>45 mm Hg,
LES resting pressure) without other abnormalities denotes a
primary esophageal motility disorder of the hypercontractile
subtype. Some patients with a hypertensive LES also have a
poorly relaxing LES. As many as 50% of patients with a hypertensive LES also have high-amplitude distal esophageal peristalsis consistent with nutcracker esophagus.
Treatment

Because the pathophysiology of discoordinated and hypercontractile esophageal motility disorders is poorly understood
and the association with symptoms is unclear, only a few
appropriately designed and powered studies have evaluated
therapy for these disorders. Generally, the medications that
have been used with success have been used to treat all these
disorders (ie, diffuse esophageal spasm, nutcracker esophagus,
and hypertensive LES).

Nitrates and calcium channel blockers both have some
effect. Diltiazem was studied in a randomized, double-blind
crossover study (60–90 mg 4 times daily), and it relieved chest
pain, compared with placebo, in patients with nutcracker
esophagus. There have been anecdotal reports of the usefulness of nitrates and anticholinergic agents, but these have not
been studied in a controlled trial.
Gastroesophageal reﬂux disease has been suggested to have
a role in spastic disorders of the esophagus, and some small
studies have shown symptomatic improvement with proton
pump inhibitor therapy.
Trazodone (100–150 mg/day) and imipramine (50 mg/day)
have been shown to be effective in improving chest pain of
patients with esophageal motility disorders, likely by modifying visceral sensation. Sildenaﬁl inactivates nitric oxidestimulated cyclic guanosine monophosphate and, as a result,
can cause the LES to relax. Several investigators have studied
the effect of sildenaﬁl, at a dose of 50 mg, on the LES and have
found that it relieved symptoms in a group of 11 patients who
had nutcracker esophagus or diffuse esophageal spasm.
Injection of botulinum toxin also has been studied in this
group of patients. The largest series included 29 patients who
had chest pain or dysphagia and the diagnosis of a spastic
esophageal motility disorder (diffuse esophageal spasm,
hypertensive LES, or nutcracker esophagus). The patients
received 100 units of botulinum toxin injected at the Z-line
(given as ﬁve circumferential injections of a 20 units/mL injection), and 70% of the patients had some improvement and
nearly 50% had complete relief.
Patients who have profound symptoms (eg, severe dysphagia associated with weight loss or aspiration associated
with severe dysphagia) refractory to other treatments may
beneﬁt from long esophageal myotomy.
Hypocontractile Disorders

Hypocontractile esophagus disorders are characterized by either
hypotensive LES alone or in combination with increased lowamplitude peristalsis (>50% wet swallows and low mean distal
peristaltic amplitude [<30 mm Hg]). It is of utmost importance
that hypocontractile esophagus not be confused with achalasia:
both may have aperistalsis (this is uncommon), but achalasia
also has a poorly relaxing LES; in hypocontractile esophagus,
the LES relaxes normally or is hypotensive at rest (Fig. 3.7).
The most common causes of hypocontractile disorders of
the esophagus are systemic disorders such as amyloidosis,
connective tissue diseases (eg, scleroderma, CREST syndrome,
and mixed connective tissue disease). Muscular dystrophies
and familial visceral myopathies also can be associated with
ineffective motility.
Patients often present with dysphagia but also may have
symptoms typical of gastroesophageal reﬂux disease. The
hypotensive LES promotes gastroesophageal reﬂux disease,
and dysphagia in these patients may be due to the underlying
motility disorder, although it may be due also to peptic stricture.
If a patient has a known hypomotility disorder and presents

with worsening dysphagia, the esophagus should be assessed
endoscopically.
Little can be done to treat hypocontractile esophageal disorders. Most patients require acid-suppressing medications
for gastroesophageal reﬂux disease and its complications.
Otherwise, the recommendation of good swallowing technique (small bites, well-chewed food, sipping liquid after bites,
and focused swallowing) is the only useful intervention.

Indications for Esophageal Manometry

Clear indications for esophageal manometry
Manometry is indicated to establish the diagnosis of dysphagia
when a mechanical obstruction cannot be found on endoscopy
or barium esophagram
Manometric techniques are indicated for placement of
intraluminal devices (eg, pH probes) when positioning is
dependent on the relationship to functional landmarks, such as
the lower esophageal sphincter
Manometry is indicated for the preoperative assessment of
patients being considered for antireﬂux surgery if there is any
question of an alternative diagnosis, especially achalasia
Possible indications for esophageal manometry
Manometry is possibly indicated for the preoperative assessment
of peristaltic function in patients being considered for
antireﬂux surgery
Manometry is possibly indicated to assess symptoms of dysphagia
in patients who have undergone either antireﬂux surgery or
treatment for achalasia
Esophageal manometry not indicated
Manometry is not indicated for making or conﬁrming a suspected
diagnosis of gastroesophageal reﬂux disease
Manometry should not be routinely used as the initial test for
chest pain or other esophageal symptoms, because of the low
speciﬁcity of the ﬁndings and the low likelihood of detecting a
clinically signiﬁcant motility disorder

Esophageal manometry can be a very useful diagnostic tool in
the right patient setting. It is important, however, to recognize

Postfundoplication Motor Disorders

Several abnormalities are detected with esophageal manometry after fundoplication. The resting LES pressure may be
higher than normal or the LES may not relax normally in
response to swallowing. In severe cases, the manometric ﬁndings can appear similar to those of achalasia, with aperistalsis
and a hypertensive, poorly relaxing LES. For patients with dysphagia and these ﬁndings, dilatation of the distal esophagus is
sometimes helpful. If not and dysphagia is profound, takedown of the fundoplication may be warranted. In most
patients who have esophageal body motility changes with a
tight fundoplication, abnormalities are reversed after the fundoplication has been taken down.

its appropriate use. The American Gastroenterology Association has provided guidelines for the indications of esophageal
manometry in clinical practice (Table 3.3).

Summary

The normal function of the esophagus is to transfer food and
liquid boluses from the mouth to the stomach and to prevent
stomach contents from reﬂuxing upward. Normal esophageal
motility is required for these functions. Motility disorders of
the UES produce oropharyngeal dysphagia, a symptom complex clinically distinct from esophageal dysphagia. Of the different esophageal motility disorders, achalasia is the one best
established, with clearly deﬁned and effective treatments. Most
other esophageal motility disorders have questionable associations with clinical symptoms and few effective treatment
options.

Answers

I.1. Answer c.
GERD can cause all the conditions or symptoms listed.
However, bad breath, or halitosis, is caused more commonly by oral disorders.
I.2. Answer c.
Endoscopy is not indicated for the initial management
of GERD in this young man who has a short history of
typical heartburn symptoms and no alarm symptoms.
The other options are all reasonable parts of the management strategy for GERD.
I.3. Answer c.
Eosinophilic esophagitis is the most likely diagnosis for
recurrent food impaction. The diagnosis is made best
with biopsy specimens from the esophagus. The pain he
experienced after disimpaction was likely due to the
mucosal tearing to which eosinophilic esophagitis is
prone.
I.4. Answer e.
This patient has recurrent reﬂux-associated stricture.
Long-term acid blockade with a PPI is necessary to prevent recurrence. Nighttime dosing is not effective.
I.5. Answer d.
Topical corticosteroids have been shown to improve the
symptoms of patients with eosinophilic esophagitis. The
other therapies listed are either not effective or not practical for an adult (eg, elemental diet). Although immunotherapy can be helpful in treating allergies, it has not been
studied in the treatment of eosinophilic esophagitis.
I.6. Answer d.
Central obesity (as determined by waist circumference
more than 80 cm), male gender, white ethnicity, and
chronic reﬂux symptoms (more than 5-10 years) are
predictive of increased risk of Barrett’s esophagus being
found on endoscopic evaluation. Currently, screening

42

for Barrett’s esophagus in the general population is not
recommended by any national gastrointestinal society.
For patients with chronic reﬂux symptoms, screening
may be considered on an individual basis, according to
the 2008 guidelines of the American College of
Gastroenterology (ACG) and the American Society of
Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE). This lack of enthusiasm for screening is based on the absence of evidence
from prospective studies that demonstrates survival
beneﬁt from screening, the relatively poor sensitivity
and speciﬁcity of reﬂux symptoms (or their absence) in
predicting or excluding the presence of Barrett’s esophagus, the absence of widely applicable tools for screening,
and the current limitations of surveillance. Only 10% of
patients with chronic reﬂux have Barrett’s esophagus
found at endoscopy, and as many as 40% to 50% of
patients who have Barrett’s esophagus (and esophageal
adenocarcinoma) do not experience frequent reﬂux
symptoms. Modelling studies (based on assumptions)
have shown that screening, followed by surveillance, in
subjects with dysplasia may be cost-effective. However,
surveillance for subjects without dysplasia is prohibitively expensive.
I. 7. Answer a.
For the diagnosis of Barrett’s esophagus without dysplasia, the current recommendation is for repeat endoscopy
within 12 months to exclude prevalent dysplasia that
may have been missed on initial endoscopy, followed
by surveillance every 3 to 5 years. The risk of progression
in patients with Barrett’s esophagus who undergo fundoplication to control reﬂux is not lower than for those
who receive medical therapy with PPIs to control reﬂux.
This was shown in a robust meta-analysis. The current
goal of therapy with PPIs in patients with Barrett’s
esophagus is symptom control. If patients have adequate
symptom control with once-a-day therapy, there is no

Questions and Answers

indication to increase dosage to twice a day. Currently,
endoscopic ablative therapy is not recommended for
patients without dysplasia. Repeat endoscopy with additional biopsies and endoscopic ultrasonography would
be appropriate for patients with high-grade dysplasia.
I.8. Answer a.
Endoscopic mucosal resection allows precise staging of
nodular lesions in Barrett’s esophagus by providing both
the mucosa and submucosa for histopathologic study.
Endoscopic mucosal resection is known to increase the
grade of dysplasia (from high-grade dysplasia to carcinoma) in up to 40% of patients referred for endoscopic
therapy and allows mucosal and submucosal invasion to
be distinguished. Margins of endoscopic mucosal resection specimens can be assessed; they correlate well with
esophagectomy pathology ﬁndings. Surgical mortality
correlates well with hospital and surgical volume, with
higher volumes associated with lower mortality rates. A
retrospective cohort study showed that overall 5-year
survival of patients with high-grade dysplasia treated
with endoscopic therapy was comparable to that of those
treated surgically. Unlike esophagectomy, endoscopic
therapy requires multiple procedures to achieve remission or eradication of dysplasia and intestinal metaplasia, followed by endoscopic surveillance to detect and
treat recurrences. Recurrence of dysplasia has been
reported in 17% to 21% of patients. Most of these are
treatable endoscopically if follow-up is appropriate.
I.9. Answer c.
The diagnosis of low-grade dysplasia should be conﬁrmed by a gastrointestinal pathologist (given the poor
interobserver agreement between community and academic pathologists in the diagnosis of dysplasia arising in
Barrett’s esophagus), followed by repeat endoscopy with
four-quadrant surveillance biopsies every 2 cm within
6 months to exclude advanced prevalent dysplasia.
In a multicenter cohort of subjects with low-grade
dysplasia followed over 3 years, the natural history of
low-grade dysplasia was characterized by reversion to
no dysplasia in the majority of subjects, stability at lowgrade dysplasia in one-third, and progression to highgrade dysplasia or adenocarcinoma in 10%. A recent
meta-analysis estimated the rate of progression in lowgrade dysplasia at 16/1,000 patient-years of follow-up,
compared with 6/1,000 patient-years of follow-up in
nondysplastic Barrett’s esophagus, and 66/1,000 patientyears of follow-up in high-grade dysplasia. Currently,
endoscopic surveillance is recommended for patients
with low-grade dysplasia: ablation, if considered, should
be in research protocols. Esophagectomy is not recommended for patients with low-grade dysplasia (but is a
treatment option for those with high-grade dysplasia).
Currently, chemoprevention for Barrett’s esophagus is
not standard clinical practice.

43

I.10. Answer c.
Preoperative chemoradiotherapy, followed by esophagectomy, has been shown to confer a modest survival
beneﬁt for patients with locally advanced esophageal
adenocarcinoma (T3 and/or N1), in comparison with
esophagectomy alone. The presence of dysphagia usually indicates invasive disease that is not amenable to
local endoscopic therapy (which, thus, is appropriate
for only mucosally conﬁned disease, given the low risk
of metastatic lymph node involvement). With the
absence of metastatic disease and the stability of the
patient’s weight, esophageal stent placement is not
indicated at this time, as would be placement of a PEG
tube, which could be indicated for malnourished
patients (>10% loss of body weight) with severe limitation in caloric intake.
I.11. Answer c.
Patients with esophageal dysphagia require a complete
evaluation to rule out anatomical and motility disorders. That this patient has had to modify her diet,
has lost weight, and has regurgitation suggests achalasia. Normal ﬁndings on EGD should not dissuade
clinicians from the diagnosis of achalasia. The “gold
standard” test for achalasia is stationary esophageal
manometry, but endoscopic evaluation also is
required for evidence of anatomical obstruction that
could appear similar to achalasia on manometry
(ie, pseudoachalasia). In this patient, a pH study may
be positive for pathologic amounts of acid exposure in
the esophagus, but it would not rule out achalasia,
because patients with achalasia often have food and
liquids stuck in the esophagus that ferment and become
acidic. Ambulatory manometry has no role in evaluating this patient; this test is used primarily in research
settings and typically does not have a role in clinical
practice.
I.12. Answer b.
This patient likely has scleroderma or CREST syndrome. The most common manometric ﬁndings in
these patients are in the category of hypocontractile
esophageal motility disorders; thus, choices a, c, and d
are incorrect. Although a complete absence of peristalsis is possible in these patients, this is much less
common than the ﬁnding of a normally relaxing but
hypotensive lower esophageal sphincter.
I.13. Answer e.
The patient has symptoms of diffuse esophageal spasm
characterized by intermittent chest pain associated
with dysphagia. Although these symptoms could be
due to several motility disorders, the “corkscrew”
esophagram is suggestive of diffuse esophageal spasm.
The manometric ﬁndings of diffuse esophageal spasm
include simultaneous contractions in 20% or more of

44

Section I Esophagus

swallows, multipeaked contractions, prolonged duration of contractions (>6 seconds), and intermittent
peristalsis. One would not expect to see an absence of
peristalsis; low distal peristaltic amplitude; a hypertensive, poorly relaxing lower esophageal sphincter; or a
hypotensive lower esophageal sphincter.
I.14. Answer e.
Patients who have oropharyngeal dysphagia and clear
evidence of a cricopharyngeal bar that obstructs easy
passage of the food bolus are treated best with cricopharyngeal myotomy, although bougie dilation can
be tried initially. For this young patient, endoscopic
cricopharyngeal myotomy would not be the best choice
because of the relative lack of published experience
with this technique. Medications have little role in the
treatment of cricopharyngeal bar. Heller myotomy is
reserved for the treatment of achalasia.

I.15. Answer d.
Recent data suggest that the most durable treatment of
achalasia with the fewest complications in young patients
who are good surgical candidates is laparoscopic Heller
myotomy with Dor fundoplication. If a dilation is to be
performed, it should be with a rigid pneumatic balloon,
not a bougie dilator. Injection of botulinum toxin into
the lower esophageal sphincter works well and has few
risks but is short-lived, with a limit on the effectiveness
of repeated dilations. Thus, it would be inappropriate
for this young patient. There is good evidence that the
combination of myotomy with partial fundoplication
(eg, Dor fundoplication) is better than myotomy alone
because it prevents most complications of reﬂux disease
that previously were commonplace when only myotomy
was performed. Esophagectomy is reserved for patients
who have a very dilated esophagus and for whom myotomy alone failed.

Peptic Ulcer Disease
Stephen C. Hauser, MD

A peptic ulcer is a persistent 5 mm or larger break in the gastrointestinal mucosa of the stomach or duodenum that penetrates
through the muscularis mucosa. At endoscopy, an ulcer should
be readily apparent with perceivable depth. Smaller and
more shallow mucosal breaks represent erosions. Most ulcers
are due to infection with Helicobacter pylori (HP) or the
administration of nonsteroidal antiinﬂammatory drugs
(NSAIDs). The term peptic ulcer disease (PUD) refers to ulceration that depends in part on the acid and peptic (pepsins)
activity of gastric juice. Gastric malignancy is an example of
ulceration that may occur in the absence of acid and peptic
activity. Most PUD involves the stomach or duodenal bulb.
Ulceration distal to the duodenal bulb should suggest
Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, Crohn’s disease, ischemia, or
malignancy.
Epidemiologya

The lifetime prevalence of PUD in the United States may be as
high as 10% among the general population and up to 20% for
persons infected with HP. The incidence of duodenal ulcers in
the United States increased during the twentieth century until
the 1960s and since then has decreased steadily, as has the incidence of HP infection. The frequency of gastrointestinal tract
hemorrhage due to PUD is decreasing among younger persons but increasing among the elderly.
Pathophysiology

Peptic ulcers occur when there is an imbalance between processes
that damage the gastrointestinal mucosa and mechanisms that
Abbreviations: COX-2, cyclooxygenase-2; ECL, enterochromafﬁnlike; HP, Helicobacter pylori; MALToma, mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma; NSAID, nonsteroidal antiinﬂammatory
drug; PPI, proton pump inhibitor; PUD, peptic ulcer disease

protect it. Mucosal defense mechanisms include the surface
mucus layer; the secretion of bicarbonate, mucus, and phospholipid by gastroduodenal epithelial surface mucus cells; the
epithelial barrier; mucosal blood ﬂow; epithelial cell restitution; and epithelial cell renewal (Fig. 4.1). Many of these
defense mechanisms are prostaglandin-dependent. Processes
that can be injurious to the gastrointestinal mucosa include
ischemia (shock, cardiovascular disease, and vasoconstrictive
agents such as cocaine), infection (HP, cytomegalovirus, and
syphilis), drugs (NSAIDs, aspirin, antiplatelet drugs, sirolimus, and bisphosphonates), chemotherapy, radiation, gastricoutlet obstruction and other acid-hypersecretory states
(Zollinger-Ellison syndrome and systemic mastocytosis), inﬁltrative disorders (Crohn’s disease, sarcoidosis, and malignancy), cigarette smoking, and vasculitis. Both cirrhosis and
chronic obstructive lung disease are associated with PUD, but
the pathophysiologic mechanisms are unclear. Ulceration may
occur in critically ill patients (stress-related PUD); this usually
involves the stomach, with ischemia being the most likely
mechanism.
Helicobacter pylori Infection

Worldwide, HP infection is the major cause of both duodenal
and gastric ulcers. More than one-half of all persons in the
world are infected with HP, and 5% to 20% of them have
ulcers. In developing countries, the majority of children
(>70%) are infected with HP before the age of 10 years, and
more than 90% of adults by age 50. In the United States, HP
infection is uncommon in persons born after 1945. Improved
sanitation and the increasing use of antibiotics during childhood may be largely responsible for this. Persons born before
1945 are more likely to have been infected with HP (60% of
them by age 60). Lower socioeconomic status and household
crowding (including children sharing beds) are risk factors for
HP infection. It is likely that the transmission of HP is from
person to person, through oral-oral and fecal-oral routes.

HP is a gram-negative, spiral-shaped microaerophilic bacterium with multiple ﬂagella. The organisms exist as dormant
coccoid forms in culture. HP survives only on gastric-type
mucosa in the stomach or metaplastic gastric-type epithelium
in the duodenum, esophagus (Barrett’s epithelium), or small
bowel (Meckel’s diverticulum). In the stomach, HP lives within
the mucus layer, surviving the acid pH of the stomach in part by
its urease activity, which converts urea (ubiquitous) to ammonia, and by its motility, its ability to adhere to epithelial cells, its
microaerophilic properties, and its proteases, which may digest
mucus (Fig. 4.2). HP does not often survive in an alkaline environment in the stomach (eg, after gastroenterostomy).
HP damages gastric-type mucosa through its production of
ammonia, proteases, lipases, phospholipases, and mucinases

Pathology; 2000.)

and by its induction of a local immune response (chemotactic
factors for neutrophils and monocytes, as well as a host T-cell
response). HP-speciﬁc virulence factors associated with ulcer
disease include a cag pathogenicity island whose product
(CagA) enters host epithelial cells, and certain vacA loci that
encode a bacterial toxin (VacA). Many persons infected with
HP have higher than normal levels of gastrin because of antralpredominate active chronic gastritis that decreases the number
of antral D cells and the level of somatostatin, thus resulting in
a slightly increased rate of gastric acid secretion and the greater
likelihood of a duodenal ulcer developing. Higher than normal
levels of gastric acid secretion may damage the duodenum and
result in gastric metaplasia, allowing HP to colonize the duodenum. This pattern appears to be more common in persons
who are infected with HP later in life. In contrast, other persons infected with HP, more often early in life, have a more
multifocal and pangastric gastritis, with parietal cell damage,
decreased production of acid, and a greater likelihood of a gastric ulcer developing.

4 Peptic Ulcer Disease

Eradication of HP in infected patients with PUD both
eliminates gastric and duodenal ulcers (along with antisecretory therapy) and prevents recurrence. Currently, in the
United States, recurrent infection with HP is less than 3% per
year.
Nonsteroidal Antiinﬂammatory Drugs

Nearly 20 million persons in the United States take NSAIDs
daily, and up to 200,000 of these will develop serious complications such as gastrointestinal tract bleeding, perforation, or
death (about 16,000 each year). Between 5% and 30% of persons who ingest full-dose NSAIDs long term have an ulcer
found on endoscopy, often without symptoms. NSAIDs and
aspirin can directly damage the gastric epithelium upon oral
ingestion (topical effects) and can systemically, when present
in the blood, inhibit the production of prostaglandins by gastroduodenal epithelial cells, thus adversely affecting multiple
defense mechanisms. Risk factors for NSAID-related gastrointestinal ulceration and its complications include age (older
than 60–70 years); pervious history of PUD (especially if complicated); the ﬁrst 30 to 90 days of therapy; high-dose NSAIDs;
simultaneous use of multiple NSAIDs; concomitant use of
corticosteroids, aspirin, other antiplatelet drugs, alendronate,
or anticoagulants; history of comorbid conditions; and HP
infection.
Speciﬁc Agents

The risk of injury to the gastroduodenal mucosa by aspirin is
dose-related and can occur even with administration of lowdose aspirin. Because of the antiplatelet effects of aspirin and
other NSAIDs, complications such as ulceration with bleeding
or perforation can occur throughout the gastrointestinal tract.
Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) selective inhibitors have been
associated with a decreased risk of clinically apparent PUD,
including complications, but similar to nonselective NSAIDs,
there are concerns about cardiovascular risks. Up to 5% of
patients who take COX-2 inhibitors may develop PUD, and
ulceration in persons who subsequently ingest COX-2 inhibitors may be slow to heal. COX-2 activity appears to be important for ulcer healing. Persons who take both low-dose aspirin
and a COX-2 inhibitor are at increased risk for PUD and its
complications compared with those who take either drug
alone. Antiplatelet agents such as clopidogrel have been linked
to a high rate of complications such as gastrointestinal tract
bleeding, particularly in patients who previously have had gastrointestinal complications, whether taken alone or with
NSAIDs. Platelets, similar to COX-2 activity, appear to be
important for ulcer healing.

have increased levels of gastric acid secretion and those who
have active or subclinical PUD are likely to be at increased
risk for PUD and its complications after initiation of NSAID
therapy. Two controlled trials have shown that eradication of
HP infection before treatment with NSAIDs decreases these
risks. In contrast, persons who take NSAIDs long term
and who have a history of complicated PUD and also are
infected with HP are not protected from additional PUD complications after eradication of HP infection. On-going ingestion of NSAIDs perpetuates the increased risk for additional
complications.
Gastric Acid

The presence of acid in the upper gastrointestinal tract along
with proteolytic pepsins is necessary for the development of
PUD. Indeed, partial inhibition of gastric acid secretion can
heal ulcers, albeit temporarily, in persons infected with HP.
Acid secretion occurs through gastric proton pumps (hydrogen, potassium-ATPase) located in parietal cells. At rest, these
pumps are located intracellularly. With stimulation of parietal
cells by the vagus nerve (acetylcholine, a neurocrine mediator), gastrin (from antral G cells, an endocrine mediator), and
histamine (from enterochromafﬁn-like, or ECL, cells, a paracrine mediator), the proton pumps are translocated to the
apical secretory canalicular (luminal) membrane, where they
become functional (Fig. 4.3). During the cephalic phase of
meal-stimulated acid secretion, vagal activity stimulates ECL
cells, G cells, and parietal cells. During the gastric phase, distention of the stomach augments vagal output and short peptides, amino acids, and calcium, as well as alkaline pH,
stimulate gastrin release by G cells. Gastrin release is inhibited
by a gastric pH less than 3. Acid pH also stimulates
somatostatin-producing D cells in the antrum and body of the
stomach, with somatostatin (as a paracrine mediator) inhibiting gastrin release from G cells and acid secretion from parietal
cells.

Section II Stomach

Hypersecretion of Gastric Acid

Infection and Miscellaneous Conditions

Mild hypersecretion of gastric acid occurs in many but not all
patients with PUD who are infected with HP, especially in
those with duodenal ulcers. Zollinger-Ellison syndrome is a
rare cause of excessive hypersecretion of gastric acid. Most
of these patients develop ulceration of the upper gastrointestinal tract, often involving the esophagus, stomach, and
duodenum, including ulceration of the duodenum beyond
the duodenal bulb. Gastric acid hypersecretion with PUD is
found in about one-third of patients who have systemic
mastocytosis because of the increased release of histamine
by mast cells. Increased release of histamine, acid hypersecretion, and PUD have been identiﬁed also in patients
who have basophilic leukemia and chronic myelogenous
leukemia with basophilia. Uncommonly, PUD patients with
gastric acid hypersecretion due to hypergastrinemia who
do not have Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (negative secretin
test) have been found to have antral G-cell hyperplasia.
Many, but not all, of these patients also are infected with
HP, and their PUD and gastric acid hypersecretion resolve
with eradication of HP. Gastric outlet or duodenal obstruction due to various causes produces gastric distention,
hypergastrinemia, hypersecretion of acid, and ulceration
proximal to the obstruction. Severe PUD, hypersecretion of
gastric acid, and hypergastrinemia are common in the few
patients who have retained antrum syndrome after a Billroth
II operation, when a small cuff of gastric antrum is left as part
of the afferent limb (Fig. 4.4). Finally, patients who undergo
substantial small-bowel resection can develop hypergastrinemia, hypersecretion of gastric acid, and severe PUD postoperatively because of the sudden loss of inhibitors of gastrin and
acid secretion.

Ulceration of the gastroduodenal area rarely occurs with
infections other than HP. In immunocompromised patients,
cytomegalovirus infection is a not uncommon cause of ulceration, often producing large, deep, and multiple ulcers and
frequently complicated by bleeding, perforation, or obstruction. Rarely, ulceration can occur from infections such as
syphilis or tuberculosis (often antral) and from postradiation
therapy, sarcoidosis, Crohn’s disease, vasculitis, and ischemia
(rare in the unoperated stomach). Ulceration can be due to
malignancy, usually in the stomach, including gastric adenocarcinoma, lymphoma, sarcoma (gastrointestinal stromal
tumors), and metastatic malignancies.
PUD is more common in persons who smoke cigarettes
and is more likely to be complicated, to require surgery, to be
slow to heal, and to recur than in nonsmokers. Although alcohol can directly damage the gastroduodenal mucosa and stimulate acid secretion, there is no evidence that alcohol is a risk
factor for PUD. Similarly, there is no clear link between either
diet or psychologic factors and ulcer disease.

Clinical Features

PUD often is asymptomatic, particularly in patients with
PUD due to NSAIDs or aspirin. Symptoms of a duodenal
ulcer include dyspepsia, which is an epigastric burning or
hunger-like sensation, especially 1 to 3 hours after a meal or
during the night, that improves after the ingestion of food,
antacids, or antisecretory agents. Thus, these patients tend
to gain weight. In comparison, persons with gastric ulcers
are more likely to experience discomfort after eating and
may have weight loss. Patients who have nonulcer dyspepsia
can have the same symptoms as those with PUD, and
many persons with PUD have atypical symptoms. Also,
the overlap of symptoms between patients with gastroesophageal reﬂux disease and those with PUD is considerable. PUD
usually is diagnosed with endoscopy, which in contrast
to upper gastrointestinal tract radiography, allows for biopsy
of gastric ulcers to exclude malignancy and to diagnose HP
infection.

Many diagnostic tests are available for making the diagnosis of
HP infection (Table 4.1). In patients who have PUD but no
obvious cause of disease (eg, NSAID use), a negative test for
HP should be conﬁrmed with a second independent diagnostic test, because false-negative results are not uncommon.
Many tests (culture, histology, breath and stool antigen tests,
and urease testing) depend on the number of organisms, and
false-negative results are frequent if the patient has been
exposed recently to antibiotics, bismuth, or a proton pump
inhibitor (PPI). Patients should not receive treatment with

(H2-receptor blockers can be taken) before testing. Testing
can be divided into noninvasive tests and invasive (requiring
endoscopy) tests.
Noninvasive Tests
Serology

Serologic tests for antibodies against HP are noninvasive,
rapid, simple, and inexpensive. Serum-based tests are more
accurate than whole-blood tests. Tests that measure antibody
levels in saliva are not as reliable. Serologic testing is as good as
any other test for the initial diagnosis of HP infection in
untested persons. However, because antibody levels may
remain positive indeﬁnitely in some patients after successful
treatment, serologic testing is not useful after treatment.
Ofﬁce-based serologic testing is less sensitive and speciﬁc than
laboratory-based testing.

Culture

HP culture after endoscopic biopsy is not widely available, is
not rapid, and is less sensitive than noninvasive tests and histologic examination. However, with culture, antimicrobial
sensitivity can be determined in infected persons with HP
infection resistant to therapy or who have recurrent relapse of
disease after treatment.
Rapid Urease Tests

Biopsy specimens obtained during endoscopy can be tested
for urease with rapid urease testing. These tests are rapid,
highly sensitive, highly speciﬁc, and inexpensive. Bacterial
overgrowth can produce false-positive results (ureaseproducing Proteus), as can non-HP Helicobacter species.
Gastrointestinal tract bleeding can increase false-negative
results.
Histology

Histologic examination is highly sensitive and highly speciﬁc,
but expensive and invasive. Biopsy specimens (5 or 6) should
be taken from the greater and lesser curvatures of the antrum
and fundus as well as from the incisura. Silver staining is recommended to facilitate the detection of HP. Endoscopy also
allows additional evaluation of PUD (eg, biopsy of gastric
ulceration to exclude malignancy or to detect gastric metaplasia or dysplasia).
Treatment

The HP stool antigen test is noninvasive, rapid, highly sensitive and highly speciﬁc, but relatively expensive. In contrast to
serologic testing, it can be used to evaluate active infection as
well as response to therapy; thus, it is cost-effective.

The treatment of PUD depends on the underlying pathogenesis. Speciﬁc treatment is available for PUD in patients
infected with HP or cytomegalovirus or who have syphilis or
tuberculosis. Patients with gastroduodenal ulceration due to
Crohn’s disease, vasculitis, ischemia, gastroduodenal obstruction, other acid hypersecretory states, or malignancy require
speciﬁc therapy directed at the underlying condition.
Treatment of drug-induced gastroduodenal ulceration is nonspeciﬁc, usually consisting of acid-suppressive medication and
often withdrawal of use of the offending drug. Elimination of
cigarette smoking will help all PUD patients.

Urease Breath Test

Treatment of Helicobacter pylori Infection

Because HP is practically the only infectious organism in the
upper gastrointestinal tract capable of producing urea via
urease, carbon 13- or carbon 14-labeled urea can be administered as a breath test. The urease breath test is relatively noninvasive, rapid, highly sensitive, and highly speciﬁc, but
expensive. Like stool antigen testing, it is highly reliable after
treatment to conﬁrm eradication of HP.

Virtually all persons with a history of PUD and all those with
active PUD who also are infected with HP should be given
therapy to eradicate HP. Therapy also is indicated for
HP-infected patients with gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma (MALTomas) or gastric adenocarcinoma. Also, HP-infected ﬁrst-degree relatives of patients with
gastric adenocarcinoma should receive treatment. Some HP

Stool Antigen

Section II Stomach

infected patients with nonulcer dyspepsia, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, or anticipated prolonged treatment
with NSAIDs may beneﬁt from eradication of HP. Indeed,
because HP is classiﬁed as a carcinogen, one could consider
treating all those with documented HP infection.
First-line therapy for eradication of HP requires 10 to
14 days of combination therapy, or triple therapy, including a
PPI plus two antibiotics, preferably clarithromycin and amoxicillin, with metronidazole in place of amoxicillin for patients
allergic to penicillin (Table 4.2). In areas where clarithromycin
resistance is high (>15%-20%), the effectiveness of this triple
combination therapy is less than 70%. If this is known, metronidazole should be given in place of clarithromycin.
Although metronidazole resistance is not uncommon, giving
it in combination with other agents (PPI, bismuth, or tetracycline) besides clarithromycin and prescribing a higher dose
(500 mg twice daily) can diminish the rate of treatment failure. Second-line therapy, or quadruple therapy, for those
whom ﬁrst-line therapy failed or as an alternative ﬁrst-line
therapy for those in areas where clarithromycin resistance is
high includes PPI, bismuth, metronidazole, and tetracycline.
Resistance to amoxicillin, tetracycline, or bismuth, is rare.
Third-line therapy can be designed on the basis of results of

specimens, if available, or the more recently proposed (but
not completely validated) triple combination of PPI, amoxicillin, and levoﬂoxacin (or furazolidone). So-called sequential
therapy has not been tested adequately in the United States.
After treatment, eradication of HP should be conﬁrmed.
Antisecretory Treatment

Treatment with antisecretory agents not only can heal gastroduodenal ulceration but also can decrease recurrent ulceration and diminish the risk of complications. Even malignant
ulcers of the stomach can decrease in size or even heal temporarily with the administration of acid-reducing agents. Antacids
and sucralfate are used rarely to treat PUD. An exception is
PUD in pregnant women, because magnesium-containing
antacids (except when given near delivery) and sucralfate are
safe to administer during pregnancy. For most patients,
sodium-containing antacids should be avoided (because of salt
load and systemic alkalosis), as should calcium-containing
antacids (because of systemic alkalosis, hypercalcemia, and
rebound acid hypersecretion). Magnesium-containing antacids may cause diarrhea and should be avoided for persons with
renal dysfunction. Aluminum-containing antacids and sucralfate may cause constipation. Prostaglandin analogues (misoprostol), which are antisecretory at pharmacologic doses, are
used rarely to treat PUD. Adverse effects, including diarrhea,
headache, and abdominal pain, are particularly common and
troublesome. These agents are uterotropic and thus contraindicated for potentially fecund women.
H2-Receptor Antagonists

Four H2-receptor antagonists (cimetidine, ranitidine, nizatidine, and famotidine) are available. All of them are highly
effective for the treatment of PUD. Cimetidine rarely is prescribed, because of its short half-life, several drug-drug interactions, which are due to its binding to cytochrome P450
(decreased metabolism of warfarin, lidocaine, theophylline,
and phenytoin), and adverse effects (eg, dose-dependent gynecomastia and breast tenderness). Ranitidine and nizatidine are
longer acting, and famotidine has the longest duration of
action. However, healing of ulceration can be accomplished
with an 8-week regimen of single bedtime dosing with any H2
blocker. H2-receptor blockers do not have anti-HP activity.
Proton Pump Inhibitors

PPIs are the most potent antisecretory agents available. They
are enteric coated or combined with sodium bicarbonate to
protect them from acid inactivation. After being absorbed in
the upper small bowel, PPIs are taken up by parietal cells and
secreted into the canalicular (luminal) space, where they are
converted to a metabolite that binds covalently with proton
pumps and irreversibly inactivates them. These proton pumps
must be active, and the parietal cells must be stimulated for the

4 Peptic Ulcer Disease

PPI-proton pump interaction to occur. Thus, PPIs should be
taken 15 to 30 minutes before a meal. They are not as effective
if administered while acid secretion is being inhibited by
H2-receptor blockers. Several PPIs are available, including
omeprazole, lansoprazole, pantoprazole, rabeprazole, and
esomeprazole. All PPIs are capable of healing duodenal ulcers
in 4 weeks. Gastric ulcers, depending on size, may require a
considerably longer duration of treatment.

Follow-up and Maintenance Therapy

Patients who have uncomplicated duodenal ulcers without HP
infection do not require follow-up endoscopy after therapy if
they do not have recurrent or persistent symptoms. If duodenal
ulcer is due to the use of an NSAID, discontinuation or reduction in the dose of the NSAID is recommended. If this is not
possible (eg, treatment with aspirin or other antiplatelet agents
in patients with cardiovascular disorders), on-going prophylactic use of a PPI may be required after treatment. Generally,
follow-up endoscopy is recommended for all patients with gastric ulcers, to exclude malignancy. However, about 95% of gastric cancers associated with gastric ulceration can be diagnosed
at initial endoscopy when an adequate number of biopsy specimens are obtained from the edge (at least four) and base
(at least one) of the ulcer. Patients at high risk for gastric cancer
(eg, born in an endemic area with a high prevalence of gastric
adenocarcinoma or ﬁrst-degree relative with gastric adenocarcinoma) or gastric ulcers with worrisome features at endoscopy
(eg, ulceration within a mass lesion or distortion of the adjacent normal fold pattern) should have follow-up endoscopy to
document complete healing of the ulcer.
Persons with gastric or duodenal ulcers who are not infected
with HP or do not take NSAIDs (idiopathic ulcers) may beneﬁt from maintenance PPI therapy to prevent ulcer relapse.
Similarly, patients with large (>2 cm in diameter) ulcers or
ulcers complicated by ﬁbrosis or hemorrhage may beneﬁt
from prolonged antisecretory therapy. Also, patients who have
HP infection and complicated PUD (eg, hemorrhage) should
receive maintenance acid-suppressive therapy after eradication of HP and healing of the ulceration.

53

Prevention of Peptic Ulcer Disease

Persons about to be prescribed aspirin or NSAIDs for longterm therapy should be tested for HP and treated if infected. If
they are at high risk for PUD (see above), prophylactic therapy
with misoprostol or a PPI should be considered. H2-receptor
blockers have not been useful for these patients. Patients at
highest risk are those with a previous history of ulcer disease;
the very elderly; patients also receiving treatment with warfarin, corticosteroids, or other antiplatelet agents; and those
with clinically important comorbid conditions.

Gastritis
Stephen C. Hauser, MD

Inﬂammation of the stomach can manifest itself as gastritis or
gastropathy. Gastritis refers to inﬂammatory processes of the
stomach in which inﬂammation is the predominant feature.
In comparison, gastropathy refers to epithelial damage with
little or no inﬂammation. Gastritis may or may not have identiﬁable endoscopic ﬁndings or clinical symptoms.
There are several classiﬁcations of gastritis and gastropathy.
Most of them distinguish between acute and chronic disease
in terms of duration (short term vs long term) and the predominant inﬂammatory inﬁltrate seen in biopsy specimens
(neutrophilic vs mononuclear cell inﬁltration). The etiology
of the gastritis or gastropathy (not always known) also may be
an important factor in the classiﬁcation, as may the topography or speciﬁc areas of involvement in the stomach.
The Sydney System (Table 5.1) often is used to classify chronic
gastritis. It requires two biopsy specimens from the antrum
(greater and lesser curvatures) and the body (greater and
lesser curvatures) of the stomach and 1 or 2 biopsy specimens
from the incisura (Fig. 5.1). In some cases, duodenal biopsies
may assist in the overall diagnosis, for example, celiac disease
in patients with lymphocytic gastritis, Crohn’s disease in
patients with granulomatous gastritis, and eosinophilic gastroenteritis in patients with eosinophilic inﬁltration of the
antrum.

Acute Gastritis

By deﬁnition, acute gastritis is an acute inﬂammatory process
that involves the stomach, with a predominate neutrophilic inﬁltrate, with or without intramucosal hemorrhage or superﬁcial

mucosal sloughing (erosion) or both. Most often, acute gastritis is related to a toxic substance (aspirin and nonsteroidal
antiinﬂammatory drugs [NSAIDs], excess alcohol intake,
uremic toxins, heavy tobacco use, or cancer chemotherapeutic
drugs), ischemia (severe stress, trauma, shock, sepsis, burns,
hypothermia, or radiation), or infection (Helicobacter pylori
[HP], cytomegalovirus [CMV], phlegmonous gastritis [multiple bacteria], or anisakiasis).
Acute gastritis due to HP infection is identiﬁed rarely. A
few patients may develop abdominal pain, nausea, or vomiting. Endoscopic ﬁndings are nonspeciﬁc (erythema and erosion) or absent. Biopsy specimens show mucosal neutrophilic
inﬁltration in the antrum, with or without desquamation and
erosions. The great majority of persons acutely infected with
HP go on to develop an active chronic gastritis.
Aspirin and NSAIDs can produce an acute injury to the
gastric mucosa, with little to no inﬂammation (gastropathy).
Hemorrhagic and erosive changes can be seen in biopsy specimens, with or without endoscopic ﬁndings (petechial hemorrhage or erosions) or clinical symptoms (abdominal pain,
nausea, vomiting, or gastrointestinal tract bleeding). Similar
ﬁndings occur after the ingestion of large amounts of alcohol
and other toxic substances and after ischemia (Fig. 5.2). All
these insults impair mucosal barrier function by affecting
prostaglandin synthesis (NSAIDs) or mucosal blood ﬂow
(alcohol or ischemia) or by direct injury to the surface mucosal
cells (NSAIDs, other drugs, or infection). Treatment for acute
gastritis includes management of the underlying condition,
withdrawal of any offending drug or toxin, and acidsuppression therapy with a proton pump inhibitor.

and gastropathy. Mucosal injury occurs in all forms of chronic
gastritis. The atrophy in the atrophic forms of chronic gastritis
can be autoimmune or multifocal, and, subsequently, metaplasia, dysplasia, and carcinoma may develop in some cases.
Nonatrophic Chronic Gastritis

This type of chronic gastritis is typical in HP-infected persons
with acute gastritis who do not clear the infection (Fig. 5.3). It
usually is most evident in the antrum. The inﬂammatory inﬁltrate includes acute inﬂammatory cells (neutrophils) and chronic
inﬂammatory cells (lymphocytes, plasma cells, and eosinophils).
Lymphoid aggregates or germinal centers may be seen. Gastric
atrophy, metaplasia, and dysplasia are not seen. Persons with
this antral-predominate, active chronic gastritis due to HP infection are at increased risk for duodenal ulcer disease.
Multifocal Atrophic Gastritis

Multifocal atrophic gastritis may develop in persons infected
with HP. This type of active chronic gastritis includes the loss
of glands and metaplastic change, principally involving the
body and antrum of the stomach (Fig. 5.4). Inﬂammation
consists of both acute and chronic inﬂammatory cells. These
patients are at increased risk for gastric ulcer disease and
gastric adenocarcinoma.

Chronic Gastritis

Autoimmune Atrophic Gastritis

Chronic gastritis is classiﬁed by the Sydney System as nonatrophic or atrophic, together with special forms of gastritis

This type of chronic atrophic gastritis is much less common
than other forms of chronic gastritis (Fig. 5.5). Autoantibodies

to parietal cells, intrinsic factor, and H+, K+-ATPase result in
mucosal and glandular atrophy, which is severe and involves
the body and fundus of the stomach. Diffuse inﬁltration of
lymphoplasmacytic cells, enterochromafﬁn-like cell hyperplasia, metaplasia, and in some patients, microcarcinoids, and
gastric adenocarcinoma may be seen. Hypochlorhydria, achlorhydria, iron deﬁciency, hypergastrinemia, or pernicious
anemia may develop in some but not all patients. Patients or
their relatives may have other autoimmune disorders including Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, Graves’ disease, Addison’s disease, diabetes mellitus, and vitiligo. There is an association
with HLA-B8 and HLA-DR3. On endoscopy, the loss of gastric folds and prominent submucosal vasculature may be
apparent in the body and fundus of the stomach.

58

Section II Stomach

Special Forms of Gastritis

A

Chemical Gastropathy

Long-term exposure to substances that can damage the gastric
mucosa can result in chronic gastropathy. Biopsy specimens
show inﬂammation (little in contrast to the active chronic gastritis with HP infection), edema, foveolar hyperplasia with loss
of mucin and glandular regenerative changes, proliferation
of lamina propria smooth muscle, and vascular congestion.
These histologic changes are most prominent in the antrum.
Common causes of this chronic chemical or reactive gastropathy include NSAIDs, bile salts, and alcohol. Endoscopic
ﬁndings include edema, erythema, vascular congestion, erosions, and, less often, ulceration (especially with NSAIDs).
Bile Reﬂux Gastropathy

Bile reﬂux gastropathy is usually due to surgical intervention
(gastroenterostomy) but can occur in persons with gastric
emptying disorders or in stomachs that have not had a surgical
procedure. Symptoms such as epigastric discomfort, nausea,
and vomiting do not correlate well with endoscopic or histologic ﬁndings. Treatment with cholestyramine, sucralfate, and
aluminum-containing antacids has, by and large, been unsuccessful. Ursodiol has been shown to decrease symptoms without improving histologic ﬁndings. Surgical Roux-en-Y revision
to divert bile from the stomach in patients with previous gastroenterostomy and symptomatic bile reﬂux gastropathy has
been found to reduce symptoms in 50% to 90% of these
patients.

B

Infectious Gastritis

Infection with bacteria is usually due to HP (see Chapter 4).
Phlegmonous gastritis is a rare, life-threatening condition
associated with full-thickness purulent necrosis of the gastric
wall. Multiple bacteria are responsible, and it usually occurs in
immunocompromised patients, including alcoholics and
patients with diabetes mellitus. Invasive procedures may trigger the onset, with fever, chills, abdominal pain, and hypotension being common. If gas-forming organisms are involved,
emphysematous changes may be apparent on imaging studies.
Mortality is substantial, and surgery may be required to
remove the necrotic portion of the stomach. Syphilis (secondary or tertiary) and mycobacteria can involve the stomach,
especially the antrum. Biopsy specimens from ulcerated or
nodular areas, with special studies (dark-ﬁeld examination for
syphilis and acid-fast stains for mycobacteria), can be used to
diagnose these infections.
The most commonly recognized viral infection of the stomach is due to CMV (Fig. 5.6). This infection may or may not
have endoscopic ﬁndings (edema, erythema, erosions, or
ulcers). Patients with CMV infection of the stomach may or
may not have symptoms, such as fever, abdominal pain, nausea,
vomiting, or bleeding, and they usually are immunosuppressed.

(From Emory TS, Carpenter HA, Gostout CJ, Sobin LH. Atlas of
gastrointestinal endoscopy & endoscopic biopsies. Washington, DC:
Armed Forces Institute of Pathology, American Registry of
Pathology; 2000. p. 123.)

Biopsy specimens from macroscopically involved and apparently normal areas may show typical cytomegalic cells and
inclusions. In the case of ulceration, biopsy specimens from the
center of the ulcer (vascular endothelial involvement) are more
likely to be diagnostic than specimens from the edge. In cases
in which the diagnosis is in doubt, immunohistochemistry
enhances the diagnostic yield. Fungal and parasitic infections
of the stomach are uncommon. In immunosuppressed patients,
gastric infections may be caused by Histoplasma, Cryptococcus,
Torulopsis, or mucormycosis. Ingestion of raw ﬁsh can result in
anisakiasis. Cryptosporidium and Strongyloides infections do
not commonly involve the stomach, especially in immunosuppressed patients.

5 Gastritis

59

Noninfectious Granulomatous Gastritis

Granulomatous gastritis (Fig. 5.7) in the absence of infection
occurs most commonly with Crohn’s disease. An inﬂammatory inﬁltrate may be found, most often in the antrum, in
patients with Crohn’s disease. Granulomatous gastritis also
occurs in some patients with sarcoidosis, collagen vascular
disease, vasculitis, drug reactions, gastric foreign bodies
(eg, sutures), or gastric malignancies. Many patients with
granulomatous gastritis are asymptomatic. In a few patients,
particularly those with Crohn’s disease or sarcoidosis, symptoms of gastric outlet obstruction due to ulceration and scarring of the antrum and pylorus can develop. Nonspeciﬁc
treatment (acid-reduction therapy) or therapy directed toward
the underlying disorder usually is indicated.
Lymphocytic Gastritis

B

Lymphocytic gastritis often is asymptomatic. On endoscopy,
edema, erythema, or erosions are seen in some patients.
Histologically, there is active chronic pangastritis with epithelial inﬁltration by mature lymphocytes, usually T lymphocytes
(Fig. 5.8). Most often, lymphocytic gastritis is found in patients
with celiac disease (more antral predominant), but it also can
occur in patients with HP infection (more body predominant
and often with polymorphonuclear cells), microscopic colitis,
or Ménétrier’s disease. Therapy is directed toward the underlying condition.
Eosinophilic Gastritis

A wide variety of disorders are associated with eosinophilic
inﬁltration of the stomach, which usually involves the mucosa
as well as deeper layers. Eosinophilic gastroenteritis, also called
allergic gastroenteritis, often includes peripheral eosinophilia
and increased serum levels of immunoglobulin E. In the most

common mucosa-predominant form (vs the serosa- and
muscularis-predominant forms), biopsy specimens typically
show patchy but dense eosinophilic inﬁltration (Fig. 5.9).
Mucosal eosinophilic involvement of the stomach also can
occur with collagen vascular disease, drug or food reactions,

vasculitis, or Anisakis infection or in patients with other causes
of substantial peripheral eosinophilia (hypereosinophilic
syndrome).

Gastropathy

A

B

Vascular Gastropathies

Vascular gastropathies are deﬁned as abnormalities of the gastric vasculature affecting mucosal blood vessels, with little or
no inﬂammation. Typical examples include congestive gastropathy from congestive heart failure, portal hypertensive
gastropathy, and gastric antral vascular ectasia (GAVE), also
known as watermelon stomach.
In patients with portal hypertension, dilatation and sclerosis of small mucosal and submucosal venules and capillaries
can produce an endoscopically recognizable mucosal mosaic
pattern, usually most prominent in the fundus and body of the
stomach (Fig. 5.10). Nodularity and punctate erythema also
may be seen. Clinically, some patients with portal hypertensive
gastropathy may have iron deﬁciency anemia or melena.
Treatment involves attempts to lower portal pressure; endoscopic therapy is not effective (Chapter 26).
Patients with GAVE develop vascular ectasias, often with
occlusion by ﬁbromuscular hyperplasia (not seen in portal
hypertensive gastropathy). Endoscopic ﬁndings typically
include linear or nodular erythematous streaks in the antrum,
without a mosaic pattern, usually not involving the body or
fundus of the stomach (Fig. 5.11). GAVE tends to occur in
patients who have an array of underlying conditions, including pernicious anemia, collagen vascular disease, cirrhosis,
renal failure, bone marrow transplantation, and antral mucosal
trauma (as in pyloric prolapse). Similar to patients with portal
hypertensive gastropathy, some patients with GAVE have iron
deﬁciency anemia or melena. Endoscopic therapy with argon
plasma coagulation can diminish blood loss in patients with
anemia (Chapter 11). Of note, liver transplantation can beneﬁt
patients with GAVE who have cirrhosis, but transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunts are not helpful (Chapter 26).
Hypertrophic Gastropathy

inﬁltration. A, High-power and, B, low-power views. (From Emory
TS, Carpenter HA, Gostout CJ, Sobin LH. Atlas of gastrointestinal
endoscopy & endoscopic biopsies. Washington, DC: Armed Forces
Institute of Pathology, American Registry of Pathology; 2000. p. 97.)

Hypertrophic gastropathy refers to a group of conditions with
giant enlargement of the rugal folds. This includes some cases
of chronic gastritis (HP infection and lymphocytic gastritis),
Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, inﬁltrative disorders (sarcoidosis
and malignancy), and Ménétrier’s disease. Patients with
Ménétrier’s disease often have such symptoms as epigastric
pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, edema, and weight loss. Many
patients have evidence of a protein-losing enteropathy (low
serum level of albumin and increased stool clearance of alpha1antitrypsin). A full-thickness gastric biopsy specimen or endoscopic snare biopsy specimen from an enlarged fold usually is
necessary to make the diagnosis, which often is suggested by the
presence of giant gastric rugal folds (often sparing the antrum)

with a cobblestone pattern seen on endoscopy. Histologic
examination shows extreme surface mucous cell hyperplasia
with deeper glandular atrophy. Often, gastric hypochlorhydria
or achlorhydria is present together with excessive secretion of
mucus. Increased levels of transforming growth factor-alpha
may be responsible for the histologic changes. Improvement in
symptoms after the subcutaneous administration of octreotide
has been inconsistent. In addition to gastric resection, treatment with investigational agents to counteract the effects of
transforming growth factor-alpha has been successful. It is
unclear if patients with Ménétrier’s disease have an increased
risk of gastric adenocarcinoma.

Gastric Neoplasms and Gastroenteropancreatic
Neuroendocrine Tumorsa
Mark V. Larson, MD

Gastric neoplasms are an important contributor to cancerrelated mortality. Of the various neoplasms that can affect the
stomach, adenocarcinoma is the most common and accounts
for up to 95% of all gastric neoplasms. Less common are
gastric lymphomas, gastrointestinal stromal tumors, neuroendocrine tumors, and metastatic disease involving the stomach
(Table 6.1). This chapter considers the epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical presentation, diagnostic evaluation, treatment, and prognosis of these neoplastic diseases.

Epidemiologya

The ﬁrst statistical description of cancer incidence and mortality, from the late 1700s, showed that gastric cancer was the
most common and most lethal of malignancies. Currently,
gastric adenocarcinoma is the second most common cancer
worldwide, with approximately 870,000 new cases and 650,000
deaths per year. Gastric cancer mortality rates have remained

relatively stable for the past 30 years, but gastric cancer continues to be one of the leading causes of cancer-related death.
Gastric cancer is rare in persons younger than 40 years, but its
incidence increases steadily thereafter, peaking in the seventh
decade of life.
The incidence of gastric cancer varies by geographic
location. Sixty percent of gastric cancers occur in the developing world. The highest incidence rates are in eastern Asia, the
mountainous regions of South America, and eastern Europe.
The lowest incidence rates are primarily in the industrialized
nations: North America, northern Europe, and southeastern
Asia. Regardless of region, gastric cancer is more common in
men than in women.
Although gastric cancer is relatively infrequent in North
America, its contribution to the burden of cancer deaths is
substantial: it is the third most common gastrointestinal
malignancy, after colorectal and pancreatic cancer, and the
third most lethal neoplasm overall.
The worldwide incidence of gastric cancer has decreased
over the last few decades. Gastric cancer was the leading cause
of cancer mortality in the world until it was surpassed by lung
63

Section II Stomach

cancer in the 1980s. Part of the decrease in gastric cancer in the
United States may be due to the recognition and alteration of
certain risk factors, such as the identiﬁcation and treatment of
Helicobacter pylori infection and changes in diet trends. The
increasingly widespread use of refrigerators was likely the initial
turning point for the decrease in the incidence of gastric cancer.
Refrigeration decreased bacterial and fungal contamination of
food, increased the availability of fresh fruits and vegetables
(which provide protective antioxidants), and lessened the need
for salt-based preservation—all of which may have reduced
some of the most signiﬁcant risk factors for gastric cancer.
Although the incidence of gastric cancer overall is decreasing,
the absolute number of new cases per year is increasing because
of an increased and aging world population. Consequently,
gastric cancer will continue to be an important cause of cancer
and cancer-related mortality for the foreseeable future.
Pathogenesis

Much effort has been made to understand the etiology of gastric adenocarcinoma. It is widely held that there is no single
cause but rather multiple causative factors, including diet,
exogenous substances, infectious agents, and genetic factors.
Gastric adenocarcinoma has two separate forms: intestinal
(or well-differentiated) and diffuse (or undifferentiated). They
have distinct histologic appearances and molecular genetic
proﬁles and appear to follow separate pathogenetic pathways.
A key difference is the presence or absence of intercellular
adhesion molecules produced when there is expression of the
cell adhesion protein E-cadherin or CDH1 gene. In diffuse
tumors, one of the initial carcinogenic events is the loss of
expression of E-cadherin, which is critical for establishing
intercellular connections and maintaining the organization of
epithelial tissues. Without this protein, individual tumor cells
tend to invade surrounding tissues without forming typical
epithelial glands. Diffuse type gastric cancers have a tendency
to invade and then broadly extend along the gastric wall.
Occasionally, the stomach is inﬁltrated extensively, giving it a
rigid, ﬁxed appearance, a condition known as linitis plastica.
Diffuse type tumors are highly metastatic and characterized by
rapid disease progression and generally a poor prognosis.
In contrast, intercellular adhesion molecules are well preserved in intestinal-type gastric adenocarcinomas, and the
tumor cells tend to occur in tubular or glandular formations,
similar in appearance to adenocarcinomas in the colorectum
and small intestine. The pathogenesis appears to follow a multistep progression that usually results from H pylori infection.
The ﬁrst stage is chronic gastritis, during which there are ﬂuctuating periods of greater or lesser inﬂammatory inﬁltrates. In
some patients, this process results in atrophic gastritis, which
is the multifocal disappearance of gastric glands within the
epithelium. Multifocal atrophy may be followed by the appearance of glands that mimic intestinal epithelium glands. This
represents intestinal metaplasia. The larger the atrophic and
metaplastic areas, the greater the chance that dysplastic cells will
develop within these areas. Dysplastic cells are precancerous.

Because these cells demonstrate increasing degrees of nuclear
atypia and cellular disorganization, evolving from low-grade
to high-grade dysplasia, the greater the chance they will
develop into an invasive, intestinal-type adenocarcinoma.
Risk Factors
Diet

Epidemiologic studies have documented an association
between diet and gastric cancer. Although dietary factors have
been shown to inﬂuence the development of gastric cancer,
speciﬁc substances have not been isolated. The most consistent association is the ingestion of nitroso compounds. Nitroso
compounds are formed from nitrates, which are found naturally in foods such as vegetables and potatoes but are also used
as preservatives for meats, cheeses, and pickled foods. These
preservatives were used commonly before the era of refrigerators. Regions that use nitrate-based fertilizers also have a
higher incidence of gastric cancer.
Diets high in salt also have been linked with an increased
incidence of gastric cancer. In animal models, high salt intake
has been associated with atrophic gastritis. Diets low in
uncooked fruits (particularly citrus fruits) and vegetables and
high in processed meat, fried food, and alcohol are associated
with an increased risk of gastric cancer. The protective effect
provided by fruits and vegetables is thought to be due to their
vitamin C content, which may decrease the formation of
nitroso compounds inside the stomach.
Tobacco Use

Smoking increases the risk of gastric cancer, especially in men,
at least 1.5-fold. This risk decreases after 10 years of smoking
cessation. Socioeconomic status also affects the risk of gastric
cancer. Distal cancer is twofold higher among patients of low
socioeconomic status, and proximal gastric cancer is more
likely among those of higher socioeconomic status.
Gastric Surgery

Patients who have had gastric surgery are at higher risk for
the development of gastric cancer. This risk is greatest 15 to
20 years after the operation. Billroth II surgery carries a higher
risk than Billroth I surgery, likely because Billroth II surgery
increases the reﬂux of bile and pancreatic juices into the stomach, which is thought to be instrumental in the development of
gastric cancer. Because this risk is low, patients who have had a
partial gastric resection do not warrant endoscopic screening.
Infection

The two infections that have been associated with an increased
risk of the development of gastric cancer are Epstein-Barr
virus infection and H pylori infection. Epstein-Barr virus
infection has been associated with various malignancies, the

6 Gastric Neoplasms and Gastroenteropancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors

most common being nasopharyngeal carcinoma. It has been
estimated that 5% to 10% of gastric cancers are associated
with Epstein-Barr virus infection.
H pylori infection of the human stomach is the most important risk factor for the development of gastric cancer. Although
persistent viral infection leads to several cancers, H pylori was
the ﬁrst bacteria linked to a human cancer. H pylori has been
classiﬁed as a group 1, or deﬁnite, carcinogen by the World
Health Organization. As reviewed above, H pylori infection
likely triggers inﬂammation that results in atrophy and may
progress to intestinal metaplasia, dysplasia, and cancer.
Although few patients with H pylori infection develop gastric
cancer, 90% of those with gastric cancer have evidence of
H pylori infection.
The precise mechanism by which H pylori infection leads to
gastric cancer is not understood clearly. It is well established
that H pylori infection leads to chronic gastritis. The inﬂammation associated with chronic gastritis reduces the mucus layer
overlying mucosal cells and exposes these cells to mutagenic
compounds (eg, nitroso compounds and free radicals). Chronic
infection with H pylori can result in the destruction of the gastric mucosa, leading to atrophic gastritis. H pylori infection has
been associated most strongly with cancers in the distal portion
of the stomach and does not seem to be associated with cancers
involving the gastroesophageal junction and cardia regions. All
ﬁrst-degree relatives of persons with gastric cancer should be
tested for H pylori infection and should be treated if infected.
Genetics

Genetic predisposition to the development of gastric cancer
has been identiﬁed. First-degree relatives of patients with gastric cancer have at least a twofold greater incidence of this
cancer than the general population. Gastric cancer occasionally develops in families with germline mutations in the p53
gene (Li-Fraumeni syndrome) and BRCA2. In 1% of gastric
cancers, germline mutations in CDH1, the gene encoding
E-cadherin, leads to an autosomal dominant predisposition
to gastric carcinoma, referred to as hereditary diffuse gastric
cancer, that has a penetrance of approximately 70%. It has
been suggested that identiﬁcation of the E-cadherin mutation
should prompt prophylactic gastrectomy in affected kindreds.
Also, certain cancer syndromes have been associated with
gastric cancer, including familial adenomatous polyposis,
hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer, and Peutz-Jeghers
syndrome.
Blood group A appears to confer an increased risk of gastric
cancer. Possibly, however, the increased risk is not associated
with the blood group antigens themselves but rather with the
effects of the genes associated with them.
Gastric Disorders

Pernicious anemia is an autoimmune-type atrophic gastritis.
Patients with this condition are at increased risk for the development of gastric cancer. Gastric polyps also may increase the

65

risk of gastric cancer. These polyps are usually asymptomatic
and found incidentally. Most gastric polyps are hyperplastic,
without malignant potential. Adenomatous polyps are less
common but may give rise to or coexist with gastric adenocarcinoma. Adenomatous polyps usually occur in areas of chronic
atrophic gastritis. Because of their malignant potential, they
should be removed under most circumstances.
Hypertrophic gastropathy (Ménétrier’s disease) is a rare,
idiopathic condition characterized by rugal fold hypertrophy,
hypochlorhydria, and protein-losing enteropathy. Gastric
cancer reportedly occurs in up to 10% of patients with this
disease.
Clinical Features

The clinical features of gastric cancer are vague. Patients often
complain of epigastric pain, early satiety, abdominal bloating,
or meal-induced dyspepsia. Weight loss, nausea, and anorexia
are common with advanced lesions. Patients with cancer
involving the distal antrum or pylorus may have vomiting due
to gastric outlet obstruction. Occult or overt bleeding may
occur in early- or late-stage cancers. Dysphagia is a prominent
symptom in lesions of the gastric cardia or gastroesophageal
junction.
Gastric cancer spreads by direct extension through the
stomach wall to perigastric tissue, and it invades adjacent
structures, including the pancreas, colon, spleen, kidney, or
liver. Lymphatic metastases occur early, and local and regional
nodes are the ﬁrst to be involved. The disease then spreads to
more distant intra-abdominal lymph nodes as well as to the
supraclavicular region (Virchow’s node), periumbilical area
(Sister Mary Joseph’s nodule), or left axilla (Irish node) or it
may result in peritoneal carcinomatosis with malignant ascites.
The liver is the most common site of hematogenous spread,
followed by the lungs, bones, and brain.
Patients with gastric cancer occasionally present with paraneoplastic syndromes such as acanthosis nigricans, the sign of
Lesar-Trélat (sudden onset of diffuse seborrheic keratoses on
the trunk), venous thromboses, or dermatomyositis.
Tumor Features
Location

Endoscopically, gastric adenocarcinoma may appear as an
exophytic, polypoid mass or as an irregular, inﬁltrating lesion
with surface nodularity or ulceration. The location of the primary tumor in the stomach has etiologic and prognostic signiﬁcance. Proximal lesions are biologically more aggressive
and have a worse prognosis, stage for stage, than distal
cancers—a ﬁnding that suggests the pathogenesis differs from
that of cancers arising in other parts of the stomach. Distal
cancers may be related closely to chronic H pylori infection,
whereas cardia and gastroesophageal junction cancers may
have a different cause, such as chronic gastroesophageal reﬂux.
A contributing factor to the persistently high mortality rate of

66

Section II Stomach

gastric cancer may be the change during the past 20 years in the
distribution of cancers from the body and antrum to the proximal stomach. Cancers involving the proximal stomach and
gastroesophageal junction have increased steadily at a rate
exceeding that of any other cancer, except melanoma and lung
cancer. The reasons for this are unclear. Distal cancers (in the
gastric body or antrum) are more common in areas with a high
incidence of gastric cancer, whereas cardia cancers are more
prevalent in populations with a low incidence of gastric cancer.
Inﬁltration

Linitis plastica, a diffuse inﬁltrating form of gastric malignancy, occurs in up to 10% of gastric adenocarcinomas. The
presence of this lesion at the time of diagnosis is usually associated with locally advanced or metastatic disease and portends a worse prognosis.
Histology

The most widely used histologic classiﬁcation of gastric adenocarcinoma divides these tumors into two types: intestinal
and diffuse. The intestinal type of adenocarcinoma has epithelial cells that form discrete glands, microscopically resembling
colonic adenocarcinoma. Typically, the intestinal type is better
circumscribed than the diffuse type, and it may be polypoid or
ulcerated or both. The intestinal type is the more frequent
variety in countries with a high incidence of gastric adenocarcinoma. It often arises within an area of intestinal metaplasia.
This pathologic variant generally has a better prognosis than
the diffuse type.
The diffuse type of gastric adenocarcinoma is characterized
by sheets of epithelial cells. Glandular structure is rarely present. The diffuse type extends widely, with no distinct margins.
Mucus-producing signet ring cells are often present (Fig. 6.1).

The diffuse type occurs more commonly in younger persons,
is less likely to be associated with intestinal metaplasia, and
tends to be inﬁltrating, poorly differentiated, and generally
has a poor prognosis.
Staging

At presentation, 65% of gastric cancers in the United States
are at an advanced stage. The most important aspect of staging
is determining whether the cancer is resectable. Staging is both
clinical and pathologic. Clinical stage is determined preoperatively, whereas pathologic staging is based on ﬁndings made
during surgical exploration and examination of the pathology
specimen. The TNM staging system of the American Joint
Committee on Cancer is used most frequently (Table 6.2). It
was updated in 2010. An important change in the most recent
version of the gastric cancer staging system is that tumors arising at the esophagogastric junction and those that arise in the
cardia of the stomach and extend proximally into the esophagogastric junction are now staged using the TNM system for
esophageal, rather than gastric, cancer.
Preoperative staging of patients with gastric cancer includes
physical examination and computed tomography (CT) of the
chest (for proximal lesions), abdomen, and pelvis. CT is best
for evaluating widely metastatic disease, especially hepatic
involvement. There are no sensitive or speciﬁc serologic markers for gastric cancer.
CT is limited in its ability to determine the depth of tumor
invasion. Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) is the best nonsurgical modality available to estimate accurately the depth of
invasion. Thus, it is most useful in assessing patients who have
early-stage gastric cancer. Positron emission tomography

(PET) or combined PET/CT appears to be more sensitive than
CT alone for the detection of distant metastases; however, its
sensitivity for detecting peritoneal carcinomatosis appears to
be limited.
Treatment

Surgery is the mainstay of treatment for gastric cancer.
Complete surgical removal of a gastric tumor, with resection
of the adjacent lymph nodes, is the only chance for cure.
However, two-thirds of patients present with advanced disease that is incurable by surgery alone. This problem is complicated further by a recurrence rate of 40% to 65% in patients
who had resection with curative intent.
Controversy persists about what is considered optimal
surgical resection, with many different opinions on the extent
of resection necessary for cancer found in different parts of
the stomach and the extent of lymph node dissection. In
practice, the extent of dissection is determined primarily by
tumor location, preoperative staging, and the condition of the
patient. Proximal gastric tumors require a more extensive
resection than those in the distal stomach. Palliative rather
than curative surgery may still be considered in certain circumstances, for example, for tumor obstruction, perforation,
and bleeding.
Gastric adenocarcinoma is relatively resistant to radiotherapy, which generally is administered only to palliate symptoms
and not to improve survival. Chemotherapeutic regimens
have shown only modest results, with a decrease in measurable tumor mass in about 15% of patients and only minimal
effect on prolonging survival.
Prognosis

Even with more advanced surgical techniques and chemotherapeutic agents, the prognosis for gastric adenocarcinoma
remains grim for all but those who are candidates for surgical
resection. Prognosis after resection varies according to the
pathologic extent of disease and the population studied. In
general, 5-year survival rates can be approximated as follows:
stage IA, 80%–95%; IB, 60%–85%; II, 30%–50%; IIIA,
20%–40%; IIIB, 10%; and IV, 7%.
Gastric Lymphoma

67

incidence of primary gastric lymphoma appears to be increasing, especially among elderly patients.
In the stomach, the most frequent lymphomas are lowgrade extranodal marginal zone B-cell lymphomas (ENMZLs)
(formerly known as mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue
[MALT] lymphomas) and diffuse large B-cell lymphomas
(DLBCLs).
Risk Factors

There are several risk factors for the development of gastric
lymphoma. They include H pylori-associated chronic gastritis,
autoimmune diseases, immunodeﬁciency syndromes, and
long-term immunosuppressive therapy.
Clinical Features

The clinical features of gastric lymphoma are nonspeciﬁc and
frequently include abdominal discomfort, anorexia, early satiety, and weight loss as well as gastric outlet complaints due to
obstruction or impairment of gastric motility and anemia due
to blood loss from ulceration.
Diagnostic Evaluation

Endoscopically, gastric lymphoma has a broad range of
appearances—from large, ﬁrm rugal folds to eroded nodules
to exophytic ulcerated masses. Enlarged folds, if present,
are due to the subepithelial inﬁltrative growth pattern of
lymphomas.
When the disease is suspected, standard endoscopic biopsy
specimens may not be adequate or the histologic ﬁndings
equivocal, especially when the involvement is primarily submucosal. Deeper biopsy or snare biopsy specimens from a
polypoid mass or large rugal fold may be needed to make the
diagnosis.
CT of the abdomen and chest is useful in identifying
involvement of regional lymph nodes, extension of the tumor
into surrounding structures, and distant metastases. If there is
no evidence of metastatic disease, EUS is accurate for determining the extent of gastric wall inﬁltration and can provide
useful information for treatment planning. In addition, the
pattern seen on EUS may correlate with the type of lymphoma
present. In one small series, superﬁcial spreading or diffuse
inﬁltrating type lesions seen on EUS were due to ENMZLs and
mass-forming lesions were associated with DLBCLs.

Epidemiology

Primary gastric lymphoma accounts for up to 10% of lymphomas and up to 5% of gastric neoplasms. The stomach is the
most common extranodal site of lymphoma and accounts for
approximately 20% of all extranodal lymphomas. It is also the
most common site of gastrointestinal lymphoma. Gastric lymphoma reaches peak incidence between the ages of 50 and
60 years and, as with gastric adenocarcinoma, there is a slight
male predominance. Although these are rare tumors, the

Extranodal Marginal Zone B-Cell Lymphoma

ENMZLs of the MALT type, formerly known as MALT lymphoma, constitute a group of low-grade neoplasms that have
similar clinical, pathologic, immunologic, and molecular features and arise in the context of preexisting prolonged lymphoid proliferation in mucosal sites. Previously, this disease

68

Section II Stomach

was often called “pseudolymphoma,” but in recent years, it
has been classiﬁed as a speciﬁc subtype of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. MALT lymphomas occur most often in the gastrointestinal tract but have been described in various extranodal
sites, including the ocular adnexa, salivary glands, thyroid,
lungs, thymus, and breast.
Gastric ENMZLs are associated with H pylori infection in
as many as 90% of cases. This association has been examined
by several investigators, and the mechanism underlying this
association is becoming increasingly better understood. In
health, the stomach does not have much lymphoid tissue.
H pylori-induced gastritis leads to an aggregation of CD4+
lymphocytes and B cells in the gastric lamina propria. Antigen
presentation occurs, followed by T-cell activation, B-cell proliferation, and lymphoid follicle formation. As these follicles
become prominent, they develop B-cell monoclonal populations that appear to be sustained by stimuli that come from
H pylori-sensitized T cells. As the monoclonal B-cell populations proliferate, they begin to spill into the gastric epithelium.
In some instances, they evolve into malignant lymphoma cells
with uncontrolled growth.
The best evidence supporting the role for H pylori in
ENMZL in the stomach is remission of the tumor after eradication of H pylori infection with antibiotic therapy. Several
clinical studies have documented complete remission in
approximately 50% of patients with ENMZL and in 80% if the
tumor is in an early clinical stage.
Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma

DLBCL describes a heterogenous group of non-Hodgkin’s
lymphoma. DLBCL may occur de novo, but it also may occur
as a high-grade transformation from a low-grade B-cell lymphoma such as an ENMZL. Transformation from indolent
ENMZL to DLBCL has been described repeatedly in the course
of the disease, and some investigators believe that all DLBCLs
of the stomach are due to transformation of an ENMZL.
Staging

The staging systems for primary gastric lymphoma are complicated (a variant of the standard staging by lymph node
involvement [Fig. 6.2]). Generally, stage I disease is limited to
the stomach and stage II disease implies localized involvement
of the lymph nodes within the abdomen. In stage III disease,
lymph nodes on both the thoracic and abdominal sides of
the diaphragm are involved. Stage IV disease is disseminated
disease.
Treatment

First-line therapy with antibiotics alone is still considered
experimental for gastric ENMZL in patients infected with H
pylori and should be approached with caution. Most patients
who have a response to antibiotics have small ﬂat mucosal
lesions and localized disease without lymph node spread or

distant metastases. Not all patients are good candidates for
monotherapy directed at eradicating H pylori infection. Only
patients with localized, mucosal, or submucosal ﬂat lesions
and without metastatic disease, lymphadenopathy, or frank
DLBCL are candidates for antimicrobial therapy alone. For
patients who do not meet these criteria, therapy for H pylori
eradication should be administered in conjunction with conventional therapy.
Once treatment for H pylori infection has been administered, eradication of the organism must be proven. Histologic
regression requires several months after the infection has been
cured with antibiotics, and patients require endoscopic
follow-up at frequent intervals. If the response to antibiotics is
incomplete or the disease recurs, standard therapies for lymphoma, such as systemic chemotherapy, radiation, or surgery,
should be administered. Patients who do not initially have a
response to or who have disease relapse after anti-H pylori
therapy still have a high cure rate. For these patients, the 5-year
survival rate is as high as 90% after single-agent chemotherapy
or radiation. Generally, the standard of care for localized gastric ENMZL that does not respond to antibiotic therapy or is
H pylori-negative is radiotherapy, which has more than a 90%
survival rate at 5 years. Treatment failures or patients with
recurrent or extensive (stage III or IV) disease are treated with
multiagent chemotherapy, such as CHOP (cyclophosphamide,
doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone).
Conventional therapy for DLBCL depends primarily on
tumor stage. Exploratory laparotomy and partial gastrectomy
may be indicated when stage I disease is suspected. For stage
II, III, or IV disease, the primary therapy is systemic chemotherapy. Radiotherapy generally is used to reduce the size of
large lesions and to control localized disease.
Rituximab (a chimeric monoclonal antibody targeting the
CD20 epitope present on virtually all B cells) has demonstrated activity in various types of lymphoma and has been
given to patients with ENMZL or DLBCL. Promising results
have been reported for a randomized study that compared
rituximab plus CHOP (R-CHOP) with CHOP alone in
patients with nodal DLBCL. This study demonstrated

6 Gastric Neoplasms and Gastroenteropancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors

improved response rates and survival for the patients randomly assigned to the R-CHOP regimen.
Prognosis

The 5-year survival rate for all patients with gastric lymphoma
is 50%. Patients with stage I or II tumors less than 5 cm in
diameter have a 10-year survival rate greater than 80%.
Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors

Stromal tumors affecting the gastrointestinal tract are divided
into two groups: tumors identical to those that arise in soft
tissues throughout the rest of the body (lipomas, hemangiomas, schwannomas, leiomyomas, and leiomyosarcomas)
and tumors referred to as gastrointestinal stromal tumors
(GISTs).
Epidemiology

GISTs are the most common nonepithelial benign tumor
involving the gastrointestinal tract, but they still are rare
tumors. The true incidence and prevalence of GIST tumors
are unknown because most of them are found incidentally.
On the basis of trials of patients with GISTs, the annual
incidence of GIST in the United States is approximately 6,000
cases (10–20 cases per million population). In an autopsy series
of patients with gastric cancer, the frequency of incidental subcentimeter GISTs was much higher, which suggests that only a
few microscopic tumors grow into a clinically relevant size.
Pathogenesis

Originally, it was thought that GISTs arose solely from smooth
muscle. In the early 1990s, knowledge about GISTs increased
dramatically, and it was discovered that some of the tumors
classiﬁed as GISTs were truly myogenic, whereas others were
neural. Of importance, the almost universal expression of the
CD117 antigen by GISTs was identiﬁed. This allowed GISTs to
be differentiated from leiomyomas and other similar tumors
of the gastrointestinal tract.
The CD117 molecule is part of the c-kit receptor, a membrane tyrosine kinase that is a product of the c-kit or KIT
proto-oncogene. In 80% of cases, c-kit activation is the result
of an activating KIT mutation. It is now thought that the
majority of mesenchymal tumors arising within the gastrointestinal tract are GISTs.
Previously, GISTs were thought to be benign tumors. Their
behavior can be quite variable; however, long-term follow-up
studies of patients with GISTs have shown that all GISTs have
potential for malignant behavior.
Clinical Features

GISTs are often asymptomatic and are found incidentally
at endoscopy or at surgery. Patients with large GISTs may

69

present with vague symptoms, as with all cancers of the upper
gastrointestinal tract, or with gastrointestinal tract bleeding.
Cases have been reportedw of patients with GISTs who present with hypoglycemia due to paraneoplastic production of
insulin-like growth factor II by the tumor.
Tumor Features

GISTs can arise anywhere in the gastrointestinal tract, but they
are most common in the stomach and proximal small bowel.
It is uncommon (25% of cases) for them to occur elsewhere in
the gastrointestinal tract.
Criteria for distinguishing benign from malignant GISTs,
or at least for identifying the tumors most likely to metastasize, have been evaluated but have not been clearly deﬁned. It
is known that the larger the tumor, the more likely it will
behave in a malignant fashion. It also is understood that the
site of origin may predict malignant behavior, with tumors
arising from the stomach having less malignant potential than
those arising from other locations.
When GISTs metastasize, it usually is to the liver. In contrast to leiomyosarcomas, GISTs rarely spread to regional
lymph nodes and virtually never metastasize to distant locations such as the lungs, bones, or brain.
Staging

Staging of GISTs primarily involves endoscopy and imaging
studies. As mentioned above, most GISTs occur in the upper
gastrointestinal tract and most are discovered incidentally.
Endoscopic biopsy specimens obtained with standard techniques typically are not sufﬁcient for deﬁnite diagnosis.
Although EUS-guided biopsy may not yield enough tissue,
speciﬁc sonographic features may distinguish GIST from other
submucosal lesions (Fig. 6.3). CT is the imaging method of
choice to characterize large GISTs and to identify metastatic
disease. On CT, GISTs appear as a solid mass that enhances
brightly with intravenous contrast.
If noninvasive methods are unsuccessful for correctly
deﬁning a GIST when it is suspected, preoperative biopsy
may not be necessary if the tumor appears to be resectable
and the patient is otherwise a surgical candidate. However,
if metastatic disease is present, surgical biopsy may be
necessary to conﬁrm the diagnosis if chemotherapy is a
consideration.
Treatment

Before the year 2000, resection was the only therapy that could
be offered to patients with GISTs. The discovery of mutations
in the KIT gene and the increase in KIT protein function and
their association with the oncogenesis of most GISTs was ﬁrst
reported in 1998. Two years later, imatinib mesylate (Gleevec),
a potent inhibitor of KIT signaling, was ﬁrst used. The next 5
years established the safety and efﬁcacy of this drug and demonstrated its clinical impact.

to imatinib in advanced disease. Because this is a rare tumor
and treatment has evolved rapidly over the past decade, it is
difﬁcult to determine an accurate prognosis that would apply
to all patients with GIST. In recent reports, 5-year survival
rates have ranged from 30% to 100%, depending on the above
factors.

Neuroendocrine cells occur throughout the body, and gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GNETs) arise from
neuroendocrine cells in many locations. GNETs have variable
biologic behavior and are categorized as poorly differentiated
neuroendocrine tumors (such as small cell carcinoma of
the lung) and well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors.
The poorly differentiated tumors are high-grade malignancies
that usually do not occur in the gastrointestinal tract. The
well-differentiated tumors typically are indolent, and most
occur in the gastrointestinal tract. GNETs in the gastrointestinal tract include carcinoid tumors and pancreatic islet cell
tumors (gastrinoma, insulinoma, glucagonoma, VIPoma, and
somatostatinoma).

(black) and is deep mucosa. Layer 3 is hyerechoic and represents the
submucosa. Layer 4 is the muscularis propria. It is hypoechoic
(black) and is the layer of origin of most GISTs. (Courtesy of

Complete resection is possible for most localized GISTs,
but only 50% of patients will remain free of disease over
5 years. For patients with recurrent disease, locally advanced
disease, or metastatic disease, the response rate with imatinib
is approximately 80%. Imatinib is not a cytotoxic agent, but
rather oncostatic. GISTs usually stop growing with this therapy, but they rarely recede or disappear.
Prognosis

Prognosis is inﬂuenced by tumor site (small intestine worse
than stomach), tumor size (the larger, the worse the prognosis), the ability to resect the tumor completely, and the response

GNETs are uncommon. Of these tumors, carcinoid tumors
are the most common, with an annual incidence of 15 per
1,000,000 population. In the United States, all other GNETs
combined have a prevalence of 10 per 1,000,000 population.
Pathogenesis

GNETs may occur sporadically or as part of an autosomal
dominant inherited multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) syndrome. All gastrointestinal endocrine tumors can be associated with MEN type 1 (MEN 1). MEN 1 is characterized by
pituitary, parathyroid, and pancreatic hyperplasia or tumors.
Clinical Features

Because GNETs are of neuroendocrine origin, they may secrete
various peptides and hormones. Most of these tumors produce several hormones, but very few are associated with a
clinical syndrome. They also produce substances other than
peptides, for example, chromogranins, which can be localized
with immunochemical studies.
Carcinoid Tumors and Carcinoid Syndrome

Carcinoid tumors, the most common GNETs, are slow growing and can occur anywhere in the alimentary tract. The clinical presentation varies from an asymptomatic incidental
ﬁnding to symptomatic tumors, including the classic carcinoid syndrome.

6 Gastric Neoplasms and Gastroenteropancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors

Clinical and Tumor Features

Most carcinoid tumors are found incidentally; thus, at the
time of diagnosis, most patients are asymptomatic. If symptoms are present, they often are nonspeciﬁc and associated
with the location and extent of the tumor. Symptoms due to
the direct effects of a tumor in the gastrointestinal tract may be
abdominal pain, intestinal obstruction, nausea, weight loss, or
intestinal bleeding.
Carcinoid tumors are rare, and those that cause carcinoid
syndrome are even rarer. Only 5% of patients with carcinoid
tumors have carcinoid syndrome. When the syndrome is present, it is associated most commonly with tumors in the small
bowel that have metastasized to the liver.
Carcinoid syndrome is due to peptides released by the
tumor into the systemic circulation. As many as 40 secretory
products have been identiﬁed; the common ones are histamine, kallikrein, prostaglandins, serotonin, and tachykinins.
The liver often inactivates these peptides, which is the reason
patients have symptoms of carcinoid syndrome primarily in
association with liver metastases: the bioactive products are
secreted directly into the hepatic veins.
The most common symptoms of carcinoid syndrome are
diarrhea and facial ﬂushing. The most common physical ﬁnding is hepatomegaly. Intermittent facial ﬂushing occurs in up
to 85% of patients. The ﬂush usually starts acutely and can last
from 30 seconds to 30 minutes. The typical ﬂush is red or
violaceous and appears on the face, neck, and upper chest.
Flushes can be associated with hypotension and tachycardia.
Several inciting factors are known for the ﬂushing associated
with carcinoid syndrome: eating, alcohol ingestion, the Valsalva maneuver, increased emotional states, trauma or pressure on the liver (including on physical examination), and
anesthesia. Anesthesia can provoke long episodes of ﬂushing
that can result in life-threatening hypotension known as carcinoid crisis. Carcinoid crisis can be prevented by the administration of octreotide before anesthesia.
Diarrhea occurs in 80% of patients with carcinoid syndrome and can be quite severe. It is a secretory diarrhea, and
patients may pass as many as 30 stools per day. Although the
diarrhea usually is unrelated to the ﬂushing episodes, the associated dehydration can contribute to the hypotension from
ﬂushing.
Wheezing is a common component of carcinoid syndrome
and is due to bronchospasm and right-sided valvular heart
disease. Unlike diarrhea, wheezing and dyspnea are worse
during ﬂushing episodes. Of importance, wheezing associated
with carcinoid syndrome should not be treated like bronchial
asthma: treatment with β-agonists can incite prolonged vasodilation and severe hypotension. Hypertension usually is not
present in carcinoid syndrome but, as stated above, the
syndrome can cause paroxysmal and clinically important
hypotension.

of carcinoid tumors vary by the location of the primary tumor.
Characteristics of carcinoid tumors based on location are outlined in Table 6.3.
Stomach

Gastric carcinoid tumors tend to occur in the body of the
stomach. They may be single or multiple, and, to endoscopists, they may appear to be an ordinary ulcer, polyp, or tumor
mass. They are often round and gray or yellow.
Gastric carcinoid tumors occur more frequently in patients
who have a disease that causes hypergastrinemia, such as pernicious anemia or atrophic gastritis with achlorhydria. They
also appear to be more common in patients with ZollingerEllison syndrome. Any condition in which serum levels of gastrin are increased for a prolonged period should alert clinicians
that gastric carcinoid tumors may be present.
Gastric carcinoids have been divided into three separate
types, each of which has a different behavior and prognosis.
Type 1

Up to 80% of all gastric carcinoids are type 1. They are associated with pernicious anemia or chronic atrophic gastritis. The
tumors are derived from enterochromafﬁn-like cells and are
thought to develop from long-standing stimulation by
increased serum levels of gastrin. Type 1 carcinoids usually are
diagnosed in patients in their 60s and 70s. As with chronic
atrophic gastritis and pernicious anemia, type 1 carcinoids are
more common in women than in men. These tumors are usually small and multiple. Metastatic disease is rare and occurs in
fewer than 10% of tumors 2 cm or smaller but in as many as
20% of larger tumors. These tumors generally are indolent
and often are considered a benign condition.

72

Section II Stomach

Type 2

Carcinoid tumors of the stomach due to hypergastrinemia
from gastrinomas are classiﬁed as type 2 gastric carcinoids.
They are rare (<5% of gastric carcinoids) and, like type 1 gastric carcinoids, they are typically small, multiple, slow growing, and indolent and have little malignant potential.
For types 1 and 2 gastric carcinoids smaller than 1 cm,
endoscopic resection, if possible, is the treatment of choice.
Because these patients often have sustained hypergastrinemia,
endoscopic surveillance every 6 to 12 months has been recommended, but progression to malignant disease and death is
unusual.
For patients with multiple tumors or advanced disease that
is not appropriate for resection, antrectomy or medical therapy aimed at reducing serum levels of gastrin has been advocated. Antrectomy decreases hypergastrinemia by removing
much of the gastrin-producing cell mass in the stomach. In a
small controlled study, this was shown to lead to regression of
these tumors.
Type 3

Type 3 gastric carcinoids are sporadic and do not appear to be
associated with hypergastrinemia. Of all gastric carcinoids,
20% are type 3. They are the most aggressive of the gastric
carcinoids, and 65% of patients have local or liver metastases
at the time the tumor is discovered. Type 3 is the only type of
gastric carcinoid that is associated with carcinoid syndrome,
because these tumors often produce 5-hydroxytryptophan.
Because sporadic gastric carcinoids (type 3) are more aggressive, they usually are treated with partial or total gastrectomy
with local lymph node resection.
Overall, patients who have carcinoid tumors arising in the
stomach have a 5-year survival rate of 50% to 95%.

remaining small bowel. Resection may be required for palliation, even in patients with metastatic disease. The prognosis for
patients with small intestinal carcinoids varies with the stage of
disease. The 5-year survival rate ranges from 35% to 80%.
Appendix

Up to one-half of intestinal carcinoids are appendiceal tumors,
and carcinoid tumors are the most common neoplasms of the
appendix. They are almost always asymptomatic and typically
are discovered incidentally at appendectomy. Incidental carcinoids are found in 0.5% of appendectomy specimens.
Appendiceal carcinoids are often smaller than 1 cm. They usually are solitary and benign. Although local invasion by appendiceal carcinoids is common, metastatic disease is rare.
If symptoms are present, they usually are associated with
large tumors, tumors located at the base of the appendix, and
those that have associated metastatic disease. Approximately
10% of patients with appendiceal carcinoids have tumors at
the base of the appendix, where the tumor can cause obstruction that may result in appendicitis. Patients with appendiceal
carcinoids may present with carcinoid syndrome, but this is
almost always in the setting of liver metastases.
The prognosis of appendiceal carcinoids is determined by
the size of the tumor. Tumors smaller than 2 cm (most tumors)
are unlikely to have metastasized when diagnosed. Tumors
larger than 2 cm are uncommon, but when they are present,
up to 30% have metastasized at the time of diagnosis. Appendiceal tumors smaller than 2 cm can be treated with simple
appendectomy. However, for larger tumors, right hemicolectomy should be performed.
The overall 5-year survival rate of patients with appendiceal
carcinoids is 70% to 100%, but for patients with metastatic disease at the time of presentation, it ranges from 10% to 30%.
Colon

Small Intestinal Carcinoid Tumors

Small intestinal carcinoid tumors are the carcinoid tumors
most important clinically because patients are more likely to
present with intestinal symptoms and carcinoid syndrome,
which occurs in up to 10% of these patients. Abdominal pain
or bowel obstruction can be caused by the direct mechanical
effect of the tumor and an associated ﬁbroblastic reaction,
intussusception, or mesenteric ischemia due to tumorassociated ﬁbrosis or angiopathy.
Most small intestinal carcinoids occur in the ileum within
2 feet of the ileocecal valve. Carcinoids that occur in the small
intestine may be multicentric and have a higher likelihood
than carcinoids arising from other portions of the gastrointestinal tract to metastasize to regional lymph nodes and the liver.
Because small intestinal carcinoids, regardless of size, have the
potential to metastasize, they should be removed surgically,
with local lymph node resection. These are the patients most
at risk for synchronous lesions (present in 30% of cases), so at
the time of surgery, the surgeon should thoroughly inspect the

Carcinoid of the colon is rare. When it occurs, it is often
located on the right side of the colon. Unlike patients with carcinoid tumors in other locations, those with carcinoid of the
colon may present with symptoms, and when they do, they
often have locally advanced disease. Local resection of the
tumor has been reported to be effective in the early stages of
disease, but many patients require radical colectomy because
of advanced disease at the time of diagnosis. Patients with
colonic carcinoid tumors rarely have carcinoid syndrome. The
overall 5-year survival rate for patients with colonic carcinoid
tumors is 30% to 75%.
Rectum

Rectal carcinoids nearly always are asymptomatic and found
incidentally during proctosigmoidoscopy. They are not associated with carcinoid syndrome. Tumors smaller than 1 cm
can be treated with local excision. Radical excision is more
appropriate for tumors larger than 2 cm or for smaller tumors

6 Gastric Neoplasms and Gastroenteropancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors

73

that have invaded the muscularis propria. The overall 5-year
survival rate for patients with rectal carcinoid tumors ranges
from 75% to 100%.
Diagnosis of Carcinoid Tumors and Syndrome

Most carcinoid tumors are found incidentally on endoscopy
or imaging studies performed for other indications. If symptoms are present and are due to local effects of the tumor, they
usually are found on CT. If symptoms of carcinoid syndrome
are strongly suspected, the best initial evaluation is with urinary 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid. Carcinoid tumors lack
aromatic l-amino-acid decarboxylase; thus, urinary levels of
5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid are increased. Octreotide scintigraphy (Octreascan) identiﬁes the site of primary tumors and
metastatic disease in more than 80% of patients with carcinoid
syndrome. Magnetic resonance imaging and selective angiography are sensitive for detecting metastases to the liver.

90%
10%

occur inside this triangle.

A
Gastroenteropancreatic Neuroendocrine
Tumors of Pancreatic Origin
Gastrinoma

Gastrinomas produce the classic triad of symptoms called
Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. This syndrome consists of peptic
ulcer disease, gastric acid hypersecretion, and a gastrin-producing tumor. Gastrinomas are rare and occur in fewer than
1% of patients who have peptic ulcer disease. Gastrinomas are
associated frequently with MEN 1 syndrome.
Etiology and Pathogenesis

The majority of gastrinomas were thought to be nonislet cell
tumors of the pancreas. With advances in technology, we now
know that extrapancreatic gastrinomas are common. One-half
of gastrinomas occur in the duodenal wall; the pancreas is the
second most common site. However, more than 90% of gastrinomas occur in an anatomical area called the gastrinoma
triangle (Fig. 6.4).
Gastrinomas are slow growing, and it can be difﬁcult to differentiate benign tumors from malignant ones. Approximately
two-thirds of gastrinomas are malignant. The best indicator of
malignancy is the presence of metastases, which most often
affect the regional lymph nodes or the liver. It is important to
determine whether liver metastases are present. If they are, the
patient is not a candidate for surgical treatment.

B

Clinical Features

Peptic ulcer disease is the most common sign of gastrinoma and
occurs in more than 90% of patients. Traditionally, the ulcer
disease associated with gastrinomas has been characterized by
multiple duodenal ulcers (including postbulbar ulcers) and
esophagitis that is refractory to medical treatment (Fig. 6.5).

Figure 6.5 Endoscopic images of, A, multiple duodenal ulcers and,
B, severe esophagitis in a patient with metastatic gastrinoma who
receives proton pump inhibitor therapy.

74

Section II Stomach

However, the most common type of ulcer associated with gastrinoma is an ordinary ulcer in the duodenal bulb.
As many as 70% of patients with a gastrinoma have symptoms or endoscopic ﬁndings of severe gastroesophageal reﬂux,
which likely is caused by hypersecretion of gastric acid. Also,
50% of the patients have diarrhea due to the effect of acid
hypersecretion on the small bowel. Increased acid exposure to
the small bowel causes morphologic and inﬂammatory
changes that can result in malabsorption. In addition, the low
pH may inactivate pancreatic lipase and cause bile salts to precipitate, resulting in malabsorption of fat and steatorrhea.
If a patient has a duodenal ulcer that is not caused by either
H pylori infection or nonsteroidal antiinﬂammatory drugs or
if a patient has duodenal ulcer disease and diarrhea, the concurrent presence of gastrinoma should be considered.
Diagnostic Tests

For patients with the clinical manifestations of gastrinoma,
the ﬁrst screening test is measuring the serum level of gastrin.
This should be done after proton pump inhibitor therapy
has been withheld for at least 7 days. A serum gastrin level of
more than 1,000 pg/mL suggests the presence of a gastrinoma.

A level less than 1,000 pg/mL but more than 110 pg/mL
may be consistent with several conditions that cause hypergastrinemia. The most common cause of hypergastrinemia generally is achlorhydria. The most common cause of achlorhydria,
in turn, is atrophic gastritis. Other causes of hypergastrinemia
associated with achlorhydria include gastric ulcer, gastric carcinoma, vagotomy, and current proton pump inhibitor therapy. Also, some disorders cause hypergastrinemia with normal
or increased acid secretion. These are gastric outlet obstruction, retained gastric antrum in patients with previous gastric
surgery, and a rare hereditary condition called antral G-cell
hyperplasia.
A gastric pH probe can be used to determine whether acid
hypersecretion is present. For a patient who has not been
receiving proton pump inhibitor therapy for at least 7 days,
gastric pH <4 is consistent with a hypersecretory condition,
and this, in combination with a markedly increased gastrin
level, is highly suggestive of Zollinger-Ellison syndrome.
A secretin stimulation test is warranted for only a few clinical situations (Fig. 6.6). If a patient has pronounced hypergastrinemia and acid hypersecretion (not achlorhydria) but the
serum gastrin level is less than 1,000 pg/mL, an intravenous
secretin test is indicated. In patients with Zollinger-Ellison

syndrome, the serum level of gastrin increases at least 200 pg/mL
over the basal gastrin level. Patients with other causes of hypergastrinemic hyperchlorhydria have only a slight or no increase
in the serum level of gastrin.
Once there is biochemical evidence of gastrinoma, the
tumor should be localized. Most gastrinomas have somatostatin receptors. The radiolabeled somatostatin analogue
octreotide used with scintigraphy can localize 85% of gastrinomas. Because most gastrinomas occur in the gastrinoma
triangle, EUS is very sensitive in localizing the primary tumor
but is less helpful in evaluating metastatic disease. CT of
the abdomen detects approximately one-half of the tumors
and may be useful for directing biopsy of liver metastases, if
present.
Treatment

Surgical resection is the treatment of choice for patients with
resectable (ie, not metastatic or locally advanced) disease.
Patients with liver metastases or MEN 1 syndrome (with multifocal disease) may not be candidates for surgical treatment
because they may have multiple tumors.
If resection is not possible, the objective in treating
Zollinger-Ellison syndrome is to control gastric acid hypersecretion. Medical treatment to decrease gastric acid hypersecretion usually consists of high-dose proton pump inhibitors;
often a gradual dose reduction is possible. The administration
of octreotide, which inhibits the secretion of gastrin, often
produces an unpredictable clinical response and generally is
not considered ﬁrst-line therapy.

75

diagnosis, a 72-hour fast is required, with the serum levels of
glucose and insulin determined at regular intervals and when
the patient becomes symptomatic. With this fasting test,
symptoms develop in 75% of the patients with an insulinoma
within 24 hours, in 95% by 48 hours, and in virtually 100%
within 72 hours.
When there is biochemical evidence of an insulinoma,
localization of the tumor can be difﬁcult because most tumors
are small. Because it is less common for insulinomas than for
gastrinomas to have somatostatin receptors, radiolabeled octreotide with scintigraphy can localize only 50% of the tumors.
Also, CT of the abdomen detects only 50% of insulinomas
because of their small size. These tumors are almost exclusively in the pancreas, and EUS has become the imaging
modality of choice, detecting nearly 90% of pancreatic insulinomas. Metastatic insulinoma is evaluated best with magnetic
resonance imaging.
Treatment

As for any GNET, deﬁnitive treatment is surgical removal of
the tumor, and this is indicated for any patient in whom metastatic disease has not been identiﬁed. According to most
reports, 70% to 95% of all patients are cured with surgical
treatment.
Patients with metastatic disease and those with insulinomas that have not been removed by partial pancreatectomy
can be managed with hyperglycemic agents such as diazoxide
and octreotide. Also, patients with metastatic insulinoma may
receive chemotherapy. The most effective combination chemotherapy is streptozocin and doxorubicin.

Insulinoma
VIPoma

Insulinomas are insulin-secreting islet cell tumors that originate in the pancreas and cause symptoms of hypoglycemia.
They are usually solitary but, rarely, may be multiple.
Clinical Features

Most patients present with clinical manifestations of hypoglycemia: altered or loss of consciousness, confusion, dizziness,
and visual disturbances. Symptoms may result also from catecholamine release caused by hypoglycemia. These symptoms
are anxiety, weakness, fatigue, headache, palpitations, tremor,
and sweating. Typically, symptoms occur with fasting, when a
meal is delayed or missed, or during exercise. Patients may
learn to avoid symptoms by eating frequently; as a result, 40%
of patients have a history of weight gain from increased
eating.
Diagnosis

The presence of an insulinoma is determined by the combination of a low fasting blood glucose level and an inappropriately increased plasma level of insulin. This combination is
identiﬁed in 65% of patients with insulinoma. For a deﬁnitive

VIPoma syndrome is caused by a neuroendocrine tumor that
produces vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP). VIP induces
intestinal water and chloride secretion and inhibits gastric
acid secretion. This syndrome is characterized by severe watery
diarrhea, hypokalemia, and achlorhydria and is known as the
WDHA syndrome (watery diarrhea, hypokalemia, and achlorhydria), or Verner-Morrison syndrome.
Pathogenesis

Approximately 90% of VIPomas are in the pancreas. Although
other tumors, including intestinal carcinoids, pheochromocytomas, and bronchogenic carcinomas, may produce VIP, they
rarely cause VIPoma syndrome. A VIPoma usually is a solitary
non-beta pancreatic islet cell tumor, and more than 75% of
them occur in the body or tail of the pancreas. Although these
tumors are slow growing, they frequently reach a large size
before diagnosis. Seventy-ﬁve percent of VIPomas are malignant, and 50% have metastasized at the time of diagnosis.
VIPomas cannot be differentiated from other pancreatic
endocrine tumors with conventional histologic or electron
microscopic examination. However, the demonstration of

76

Section II Stomach

immunoreactive VIP in the tumor and plasma establishes the
diagnosis.
Clinical Features

As stated above, VIPomas cause secretory diarrhea, which
results in hypokalemia and dehydration. Stool volume may
exceed 3 L/day. The watery diarrhea resembles that of cholera,
hence the term pancreatic cholera. Erythematous ﬂushing of
the head and trunk may occur in some patients. Also, some
patients develop hyperglycemia because of VIP- and
hypokalemia-induced glycogenolysis in the liver.
Diagnosis

VIPoma syndrome should be suspected if patients present
with high-volume watery diarrhea that persists despite fasting
and is associated with hypokalemia and dehydration. The
diagnosis is conﬁrmed by the ﬁnding of an increased plasma
concentration of VIP. Because these tumors are large, frequently malignant, and metastatic, the abdomen should be
scanned with CT to localize and determine the extent of tumor
involvement. Magnetic resonance imaging is also effective for
localizing the tumor and demonstrating metastatic disease.
Other imaging studies may not be necessary. Preliminary data
indicate that somatostatin receptor scanning and EUS also are
effective for imaging these tumors.
Treatment

The ﬁrst priority of treatment is to correct the dehydration
and electrolyte abnormalities. Patients may require 5 L or
more of ﬂuid per day, with aggressive potassium replacement.
Long-acting octreotide controls the diarrhea in most patients
with VIPoma, and this agent is considered the initial treatment of choice. For patients who do not have a response to
somatostatin analogues, concomitant administration of glucocorticoids may be tried because the combination has had
some success.
After imaging studies have localized and determined the
extent of tumor involvement, surgery should be considered
for all patients without evidence of metastatic disease. Surgical
resection of a pancreatic VIPoma relieves all symptoms and is
curative in approximately 30% of patients. Surgery also may
be indicated to relieve local effects produced by the large size
of the tumor.
For patients with metastatic disease, the best treatment
option is chemotherapy. The most effective chemotherapy
regimens are streptozocin plus doxorubicin or ﬂuorouracil,
which achieve partial remission in up to 90% of patients.
Glucagonoma

Glucagonomas produce a rare syndrome of dermatitis, glucose intolerance, weight loss, and anemia associated with a
pancreatic islet cell tumor.

Pathogenesis

Glucagonomas usually are solitary, large tumors with an average size of 5 to 6 cm at the time of diagnosis. Sixty-ﬁve percent
of the tumors are located in the head of the pancreas, and the
other 35% occur equally in the body and tail. Most tumors are
metastatic at the time of diagnosis.
Clinical Features

Glucagonomas occur in persons 45 to 70 years old. The characteristic presentation is that of a distinct dermatitis called
necrolytic migratory erythema, which usually develops a mean
of 7 years before the onset of other symptoms. This rash starts
as an erythematous area, typically in an intertriginous area
such as the groin, buttocks, thighs, or perineum, or it may
start in perioriﬁcial areas. The erythematous lesions spread
laterally and then become raised, with superﬁcial central blistering or bullous formation. When the bullae rupture, crusting occurs and the lesions begin to heal in the center. Healing
is associated with hyperpigmentation. The entire sequence
usually takes 1 to 2 weeks and consists of a mixed pattern of
erythema, bullous formation, epidermal separation, crusting,
and hyperpigmentation, which wax and wane. Glossitis, angular stomatitis, dystrophic nails, and hair thinning are other
clinical ﬁndings. The majority of patients with glucagonoma
also have hypoaminoacidemia, which may be responsible for
the rash. The rash improves with treatment with amino acids
and nutrition.
Glucagon stimulates glycogenolysis, gluconeogenesis,
lipolysis, ketogenesis, and insulin secretion and inhibits pancreatic and gastric secretion and intestinal motility. Most
patients have glucose intolerance, and some may have frank
diabetes mellitus. Most patients with glucagonoma also have
noticeable weight loss, even if the tumor is found incidentally
and is small. It is believed that glucagon exerts a catabolic
effect. Some patients also may have anorexia.
Diagnosis

If the clinical features of glucagonoma are present, the diagnosis can be conﬁrmed by the ﬁnding of an increased plasma
glucagon level of more than 1,000 pg/mL. Because glucagonomas occur in the pancreas and tend to be large and metastatic
at the time of clinical presentation, CT of the abdomen usually
localizes the tumor.
Treatment

The initial objective of treatment is to control the symptoms
and hyperglycemia and to restore nutritional status. The surgical risk of these patients usually is increased because of the
catabolic effects of glucagon, glucose intolerance, and hypoaminoacidemia. Patients should receive nutritional support,
and the hyperglycemia should be corrected. The rash may
improve with correction of the hypoaminoacidemia. If anemia

is pronounced, transfusion may be needed. Octreotide is
useful for controlling symptoms, and it improves the dermatitis, weight loss, diarrhea, and abdominal pain but not
diabetes mellitus. Surgery is offered to all patients who are
acceptable surgical risks and who do not have evidence of
metastatic spread of the tumor, but it is curative in only 20%
of them.
In patients with metastatic disease, it is important to remember that the tumors are slow growing and survival is good even
for those who do not receive chemotherapy. There is no clear
evidence that chemotherapy has any important effect on these
tumors. The most commonly used chemotherapeutic agents
are streptozocin and doxorubicin or ﬂuorouracil.

helpful in treatment. However, somatostatinomas are rare,
and more reports are needed to determine the efﬁcacy of
octreotide.
Surgical excision is the treatment of choice, but most
patients present with metastatic disease. Cytotoxic chemotherapy is offered to patients who have evidence of metastatic
disease, but there is no clear evidence that this treatment is
effective.

Somatostatinoma

In general, the treatment of GNETs is based on the following:
localization of the tumor and identiﬁcation of metastatic disease if present, resection of the primary tumor if appropriate,
and control of symptoms, such as those associated with carcinoid syndrome (Fig. 6.7).
The liver is the predominant site of metastatic disease. Liver
resection is indicated for the treatment of metastatic liver disease in the absence of diffuse bilobar involvement, compromised liver function, or extensive extrahepatic metastases.
Although surgery is not curative in the majority of cases,
symptoms of hormone hypersecretion are effectively palliated
and prolonged survival is often possible because these tumors
are slow growing.
Other therapies can be directed at speciﬁc components of
the syndrome. Carcinoid syndrome patients with ﬂushing
should avoid ingesting substances that can induce ﬂushing,
such as alcohol. Also, physical therapy that could involve pressure or trauma to the right upper quadrant should be avoided.
Certain drugs, such as codeine and cholestyramine, can help
control ﬂushing and diarrhea. Severe symptoms often require
a somatostatin analogue such as octreotide.
Flushing and diarrhea can be ameliorated in up to 80% of
patients treated with octreotide. A depot form of octreotide
(Sandostatin LAR) has been developed that allows for monthly,
rather than three times daily, administration. Typically,
patients start a brief trial of the short-acting form of octreotide
(to assess for symptomatic response and tolerance) and then
start receiving a dose of 20 mg intramuscularly monthly, with
a gradual increase in the dose as needed for control of symptoms. Patients also can be given short-acting, subcutaneous
octreotide for breakthrough symptoms.
In addition to improving symptoms, octreotide may retard
tumor growth. Because octreotide is not cytotoxic, the disease
rarely regresses.
Patients who have progressive metastatic carcinoid tumors
have few therapeutic options, and the best systemic therapy
has not been deﬁned. Several cytotoxic drugs (streptozocin
and doxorubicin or ﬂuorouracil) have been tried in various
combinations and generally have had minimal effect on these
tumors. The lack of effectiveness of any one agent or combination of agents has led to debate about whether chemotherapy
is appropriate for these patients.

Somatostatinomas are the least common of the GNETs. They
produce a distinct syndrome of diabetes mellitus, gallbladder
disease, and steatorrhea.
Pathogenesis

Somatostatinomas are neuroendocrine tumors that occur in
the pancreas and intestine. Tumors that arise in the pancreas
tend to have higher levels of somatostatin and are more likely to
produce symptoms. Somatostatinomas are usually solitary
and large, and the majority have metastasized at the time of
diagnosis. Somatostatin inhibits insulin release, gallbladder
motility, and secretion of pancreatic enzymes and bicarbonate.
Somatostatinomas are not associated with MEN 1. However, they have been found in patients with pheochromocytoma, café au lait spots, and neuroﬁbromatosis, suggesting a
possible association with MEN 2B.
Clinical Features

Diabetes mellitus occurs in one-half of the patients with somatostatinoma. Gallbladder disease occurs in 65% of the patients
and usually is manifested as cholelithiasis, acalculous cholecystitis, or obstructive jaundice from local tumor invasion.
Steatorrhea occurs in one-third of the patients.
Diagnosis

Most somatostatinomas are found incidentally when laparotomy is performed for gallbladder disease. The diagnosis is
established by the ﬁnding of somatostatin-containing D cells
in the resected tumor and an increased plasma concentration
of somatostatin-like immunoreactive material. Tumors are
localized with CT, EUS, or ultrasonography of the abdomen.
Treatment

Diabetes mellitus usually is mild and responds to oral hypoglycemic agents or low doses of insulin. No speciﬁc medical treatment exists for treating somatostatinomas. Octreotide may be

Metastatic Disease to the Stomach

When a patient presents with upper gastrointestinal tract
symptoms and a history of a primary extragastric neoplasm,
metastatic involvement of the stomach should be considered
as a possible explanation of the symptoms.
Malignant melanoma is one of the most frequently encountered metastatic lesions to the stomach. At endoscopy, it usually appears as a slightly elevated black nodule. Cancer of the
breast, lung, ovary, testis, liver, or colon or sarcoma can all
involve the stomach.

Gastrointestinal Motility Disordersa
G. Richard Locke III, MD

Motility disorders result from impaired control of the neuromuscular apparatus of the gut. Associated symptoms include
recurrent or chronic nausea, vomiting, bloating and abdominal discomfort, constipation, or diarrhea, which occur in the
absence of intestinal obstruction. Occasionally, gastroparesis
and intestinal pseudo-obstruction are associated with generalized disease processes that affect other regions of the gastrointestinal tract and extraintestinal organs, including the urinary
bladder. For many people, the role of motility in generating
symptoms is unclear. Such patients are thought to have a
functional gastrointestinal disorder, speciﬁcally functional
dyspepsia.

Control of Gastrointestinal Motor Functiona

Motor function of the gastrointestinal tract depends on the
contraction of smooth muscle cells and their integration and
modulation by enteric and extrinsic nerves. Derangement of
the mechanisms that regulate gastrointestinal motor function
may lead to altered gut motility. Neurogenic modulators of
gastrointestinal motility include the central nervous system,
the autonomic nerves, and the enteric nervous system.
Extrinsic neural control of gastrointestinal motor function
consists of the cranial and sacral parasympathetic outﬂow
(excitatory to nonsphincteric muscle) and the thoracolumbar
sympathetic supply (excitatory to sphincters, inhibitory to
nonsphincteric muscle). The cranial outﬂow is predominantly

through the vagus nerve, which innervates the gastrointestinal
tract from the stomach to the right colon and consists of
preganglionic cholinergic ﬁbers that synapse with the enteric
nervous system. The supply of sympathetic ﬁbers to the stomach and small bowel arises from levels T5 to T10 of the intermediolateral column of the spinal cord. The prevertebral
ganglia have an important role in the integration of afferent
impulses between the gut and the central nervous system and
reﬂex control of abdominal viscera.
The enteric nervous system is an independent nervous
system consisting of approximately 100 million neurons organized into ganglionated plexuses. The larger myenteric (or
Auerbach) plexus is situated between the longitudinal and circular muscle layers of the muscularis externa and contains
neurons responsible for gastrointestinal motility. The submucosal (or Meissner) plexus controls absorption, secretion,
and mucosal blood ﬂow. The enteric nervous system is also
important in visceral afferent function.
The enteric nervous system develops in utero by migration
of neural crest cells to the developing alimentary canal. This
migration and the sequence of innervation of different levels
of the gut are regulated by speciﬁc signaling molecules, which
include transcription factors (eg, Mash1), neurotrophic factors (eg, glial-derived neurotrophic factor), and the neuregulin signaling system. These facilitate the growth, differentiation,
and persistence of the migrating nerve cells after they arrive in
the gut. The receptors for neuregulin proteins are tyrosine
kinases, which are important in cell signaling.
Myogenic factors regulate the electrical activity generated
by gastrointestinal smooth muscle cells. The interstitial cells of
Cajal, located at the interface of the circular and longitudinal
muscle layers of the small intestine, form a nonneural pacemaker system and function as intermediaries between the
neurogenic (enteric nervous system) and myogenic control
systems. The interstitial cells of Cajal are in proximity to the
gastrointestinal smooth muscle cells. Electrical control activity
spreads through the contiguous segments of the gut through

neurochemical activation by excitatory (eg, acetylcholine and
substance P) and inhibitory (eg, nitric oxide, somatostatin,
and vasoactive intestinal peptide) transmitters.

Gastric And Small-Bowel Motility

The motor functions of the stomach and small intestine are
characterized by distinct manometric patterns of activity in
the fasting and postprandial periods (Fig. 7.1). The fasting (or
interdigestive) period is characterized by a cyclic motor phenomenon called the interdigestive migrating motor complex. In
healthy persons, one cycle of the interdigestive migrating
motor complex is completed every 60 to 90 minutes. The
interdigestive migrating motor complex has three phases: a
period of quiescence (phase I), a period of intermittent pressure activity (phase II), and an activity front (phase III), during
which the stomach and small intestine contract at highest frequency (3 per minute in the stomach and 12 per minute in the
upper small intestine). Phase III migrates for a variable distance through the small intestine; there is a gradient in the
frequency of contractions from approximately 12 per minute
in the duodenum to approximately 8 per minute in the ileum.
Another characteristic interdigestive motor pattern in the
distal small intestine is the giant migrating complex, or power
contraction; it serves to empty residue from the ileum into the
colon in bolus transfers.
In the postprandial period, the interdigestive migrating
motor complex is replaced by an irregular pressure response
pattern of variable amplitude and frequency, which enables
mixing and absorption. This pattern is observed in the regions
in contact with food. The maximal frequency of contractions
is lower than that noted during phase III of the interdigestive

Catheter channel

migrating motor complex. The duration of the postprandial
motor activity is proportional to the number of calories consumed during the meal: approximately 1 hour for every 200 kcal
ingested. Segments of the small intestine that are not in contact
with food continue to display interdigestive motor patterns.
The proximal stomach accommodates food through a
decrease in its tone, facilitating the ingestion of food without
an increase in pressure. This reﬂex is mediated by the vagus
nerve and involves an intrinsic nitrergic neuron.
Liquids empty from the stomach in an exponential manner
(Fig. 7.2). The half-emptying time for nonnutrient liquids in
healthy persons is usually less than 20 minutes. Solids are

retained selectively in the stomach until particles have been
tritrated to less than 2 mm in diameter. Therefore, gastric
emptying of solids is characterized by an initial lag period followed by a linear post-lag emptying phase. The small intestine
transports solids and liquids at approximately the same rate.
Because of the lag phase for the transport of solids from the
stomach, liquids typically arrive in the colon before solids do.

cells of Cajal (or intestinal pacemakers), or smooth muscle.
Combined disorders occur in systemic sclerosis, amyloidosis,
and mitochondrial cytopathy and can appear initially with
neuropathic patterns; later, with disease progression, they can
display myopathic characteristics. Motility disorders can be
congenital (affecting the development of the motility apparatus) or acquired.

Pathogenesis of Motility Disorders

Genetic defects in migration, differentiation, and survival of
enteric neurons have been identiﬁed in several causes of gut
dysmotility, including abnormalities of cRET (the gene that
encodes for the tyrosine kinase receptor), the endothelin
B system (which tends to retard development of neural elements, thereby facilitating colonization of the entire gut
from the neural crest), Sox10 (a transcription factor that
enhances the maturation of neural precursors), and ckit
(a marker for the interstitial cells of Cajal). Disturbances in
these mechanisms result in syndromic dysmotilities such
as Hirschsprung’s disease, Waardenburg-Shah syndrome
(pigmentary defects, piebaldism, neural deafness, and megacolon), and idiopathic hypertrophic pyloric stenosis.

Extrinsic Neuropathic Disorders

Extrinsic neuropathic processes include vagotomy, diabetes
mellitus, trauma, Parkinson’s disease, amyloidosis, and a
paraneoplastic syndrome usually associated with small cell
carcinoma of the lung. Another common “neuropathic” problem met in clinical practice results from the effect of medications such as α2-adrenergic agonists and anticholinergic agents
on neural control.
Damage to the autonomic nerves by trauma, infection,
neuropathy, or neurodegeneration may lead to motor, secretory, and sensory disturbances, most frequently resulting in
constipation rather than upper gastrointestinal tract motility
disorders. However, the latter may occur in patients with a
high spinal cord injury or occur secondarily to constipation
and fecal impaction. Parkinson’s disease and multiple sclerosis are two neurologic diseases involving the extrinsic nervous
system that frequently are associated with constipation. In
Parkinson’s disease, a decrease in the number of dopaminecontaining neurons and the presence of Lewy bodies in myenteric plexus neurons have been described. Also, failure of the
striated muscles of the pelvic ﬂoor to relax may be an extrapyramidal manifestation of Parkinson’s disease. Multiple sclerosis is associated with slow colonic transit and absence of the
postprandial motor contractile response in the colon. Gastroparesis and pseudo-obstruction are less frequent than constipation in these two diseases.
A broad spectrum of gastrointestinal motility disorders
may be related to diabetes mellitus: gastroparesis, pylorospasm, intestinal pseudo-obstruction, diarrhea, constipation,
and incontinence. All these manifestations may be caused by

autonomic dysfunction (Table 7.2), although evidence points
to the importance of acute changes in glycemia and, more
importantly, to changes in the structure and function of the
enteric nervous system. From a population perspective, constipation is the most important gastrointestinal symptom in
patients with diabetes because it is the most prevalent symptom. Moreover, in a large group that had screening tests for
autonomic neuropathy, the prevalence of constipation was
22% among the diabetic patients with neuropathy but only
9.2% among those without neuropathy, which was not signiﬁcantly different from that of the healthy control group. In a
questionnaire-based study of diabetic patients in the community, constipation was more prevalent in insulin-dependent
diabetes mellitus than in noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and was associated with symptoms of dysautonomia and
use of constipating drugs, for example, calcium channel blockers. In hospital practice, gastroparesis frequently is encountered as a complication of diabetes. Apart from added attention
needed for metabolic control, its management follows that of
other causes of gastroparesis and pseudo-obstruction.
Enteric or Intrinsic Neuropathic Disorders

Disorders of the enteric nervous system are usually the result of
a degenerative, immune, or inﬂammatory process. Only rarely
can the cause be ascertained in these disturbances. Virally
induced gastroparesis (eg, Rotavirus, Norwalk virus, cytomegalovirus, or Epstein-Barr virus) and pseudo-obstruction as well

as degenerative disorders associated with inﬁltration of the
myenteric plexus by inﬂammatory cells suggest that infection
may be an important predisposing factor. In idiopathic chronic
intestinal pseudo-obstruction, there is no disturbance of
extrinsic neural control and no identiﬁed cause for abnormality of the enteric nervous system.
A full-thickness biopsy specimen from the intestine may be
required to evaluate the myenteric plexus and interstitial cells
of Cajal. The decision to perform a biopsy needs to be weighed
against the risk of complications, including the subsequent
formation of adhesions and, possibly, mechanical obstruction
superimposed on episodes of pseudo-obstruction.
Smooth Muscle Disorders

Disturbances of smooth muscle may result in major disorders
of gastric emptying and small-bowel and colonic transit.
These disturbances include systemic sclerosis and amyloidosis.
Dermatomyositis, dystrophia myotonica, and metabolic
muscle disorders such as mitochondrial cytopathy are seen
infrequently. In rare instances, there is a positive family
history (eg, hollow visceral myopathy may occur either sporadically or in families). Motility disturbances may be the
result of metabolic disorders such as hypothyroidism or
hyperparathyroidism, but these patients more often present
with constipation.
Scleroderma may result in focal or general dilatation, diverticula (often wide-mouthed, especially in the colon), and
delayed transit at the levels affected. The amplitude of contractions is decreased (average <30 mm Hg in the distal esophagus, <40 mm Hg in the antrum, and <10 mm Hg in the small
bowel) compared with that of controls. Bacterial overgrowth
is common and may result in steatorrhea.
A mitochondrial disorder that affects the gut is called mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalomyopathy. It is
referred to also as oculogastrointestinal muscular dystrophy
or familial visceral myopathy type II and is an example of a
spectrum of diseases that affect oxidative phosphorylation. It
is an autosomal recessive condition with gastrointestinal and
liver manifestations that may present at any age, typically with
hepatomegaly or liver failure in the neonate, seizures or diarrhea in infancy, and liver failure or chronic intestinal pseudoobstruction in children and adults.
Mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalomyopathy
is characterized also by external ophthalmoplegia, ptosis,
peripheral neuropathy, and leukoencephalopathy. The small
intestine is dilated or has multiple diverticula, and the amplitude of contractions is low, typical of a myopathic disorder.
Some patients have a combination of intestinal dysmotility or
transfer dysphagia due to abnormal coordination and propagation of the swallow through the pharynx and the skeletal
muscle portion of the esophagus. This becomes even more
devastating when the smooth muscle portion of the esophagus
is affected by the associated mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalomyopathy.

7 Gastrointestinal Motility Disorders

Management of Gastroparesis and
Pseudo-Obstruction
Clinical Features

The clinical features of gastroparesis and chronic intestinal
pseudo-obstruction are similar and include nausea, vomiting,
early satiety, abdominal discomfort, distention, bloating,
and anorexia. Patients with severe stasis and vomiting may
have considerable weight loss and depletion of mineral
and vitamin stores. The severity of the motility problem
often manifests itself most clearly in the degree of
nutritional and electrolyte depletion. Disturbances of
bowel movements, such as diarrhea and constipation, indicate
that the motility disorder is more extensive than gastroparesis. Severe vomiting may be complicated by aspiration
pneumonia or Mallory-Weiss tears that may result in
gastrointestinal tract hemorrhage. When patients have a
more generalized motility disorder, they also may have symptoms referable to abnormal swallowing or delayed colonic
transit.
A family history and medication history are essential for
identifying underlying etiologic factors. A careful review of
systems helps reveal an underlying collagen vascular disease
(eg, scleroderma) or disturbances of extrinsic neural control
that also may be affecting the abdominal viscera. Such symptoms include orthostatic dizziness, difﬁculties with erection or
ejaculation, recurrent urinary tract infections, difﬁculty with
visual accommodation in bright lights, absence of sweating,
and dry mouth, eyes, or vagina.
A succussion splash detected on physical examination
usually indicates a region of stasis within the gastrointestinal
tract, typically the stomach. The hands and mouth may
show signs of Raynaud’s phenomenon or scleroderma.
Testing pupillary responses to light and accommodation,
testing external ocular movement, measuring blood pressure
in the supine and standing positions, and noting the
general features of peripheral neuropathy can identify
patients who have a neurologic disturbance or oculogastrointestinal dystrophy associated typically with mitochondrial
cytopathy.
Conditions to be differentiated are mechanical obstruction
(eg, from peptic stricture or Crohn’s disease in the small intestine), functional gastrointestinal disorders, and eating disorders such as anorexia nervosa and rumination syndrome. The
degree of impairment of gastric emptying in eating disorders
is relatively minor compared with that of diabetic or postvagotomy gastric stasis.
A typical history of a person with rumination syndrome is
early (0-30 minutes) postprandial, effortless regurgitation of
undigested food that happens with virtually every meal. This
condition occurs in mentally challenged children (eg, Down’s
syndrome) but increasingly is recognized in adolescents and
adults of normal intelligence. It is treatable with behavioral
modiﬁcation.

85

Investigation

A motility disorder of the stomach or small bowel should be
suspected whenever large volumes are aspirated from the
stomach, particularly after an overnight fast or when undigested solid food or large volumes of liquids are observed
during esophagogastroduodenoscopy. The following four
questions should be considered in the management of each
patient:
1.
2.
3.
4.

Are the symptoms acute or chronic?
Is the disease due to neuropathy or myopathy?
What regions of the digestive tract are affected?
What is the status of hydration and nutrition?

The recommended sequence of investigations is as follows:
1. Suspect and exclude mechanical obstruction. In patients
with pseudo-obstruction, plain radiographs of the abdomen taken at the time of symptoms typically show
dilated loops of small bowel with associated air-ﬂuid
levels. Mechanical obstruction should be excluded with
upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and barium studies,
including a small-bowel follow-through series or computed tomographic enterography. Barium studies fortuitously may suggest the presence of a motor disorder,
particularly if there is gross dilatation, dilution of
barium, or retained solid food within the stomach.
However, these studies rarely identify the cause. An
exception is small-bowel systemic sclerosis, which is
characterized by megaduodenum and packed valvulae
conniventes in the small intestine.
2. Assess gastric and small-bowel motility. After mechanical obstruction and alternative diagnoses such as Crohn’s
disease have been excluded, a transit proﬁle of the stomach or small bowel (or both) should be performed. Efﬁciency in the emptying of solids is the most sensitive
measurement of upper gastrointestinal tract transit.
Scans typically are performed at 0, 1, 2, 4, and 6 hours
after ingestion of a radiolabeled meal. If the cause of the
motility disturbance is obvious, such as gastroparesis in
a patient with long-standing diabetes mellitus, further
diagnostic testing usually is not needed. If the cause is
unclear, gastroduodenal manometry, with the use of a
multilumen tube with sensors in the distal stomach and
proximal small intestine, can distinguish between neuropathic and myopathic processes (Fig. 7.3). Neuropathies are characterized by contractions of normal
amplitude, but abnormal patterns of contractility. In
contrast, the predominant disturbance in myopathic
disorders is the low amplitude of contractions in the
segments affected (Fig. 7.3).
3. Identify the pathogenesis. Causes of gastroparesis and
intestinal pseudo-obstruction are outlined in Table 7.1.
In the absence of a cause for a neuropathic pattern of
motor activity in the small intestine, it is necessary to

autoantibodies (ANNA-1) associated with paraneoplastic syndromes, and magnetic resonance imaging of the
brain to exclude a brainstem lesion in patients with
vomiting (Fig. 7.4). Autonomic testing may include
evaluation for orthostatic hypotension, assessment of
supine and standing serum norepinephrine levels, measurement of the heart rate interval change during deep
breathing, and plasma pancreatic polypeptide response
to modiﬁed sham feeding. This testing can identify sympathetic adrenergic or vagal neuropathy. The identiﬁcation of a myopathic disorder on initial testing should
lead to a search for amyloidosis (immunoglobulin electrophoresis, fat aspirate, or rectal biopsy), systemic sclerosis (Scl-70), and a family history of gastrointestinal
motility disorders. Laboratory studies to consider
include assessment of thyroid function and levels of
antinuclear antibody, lactate, creatine phosphokinase,
aldolase, porphyrins, and serologic study for Chagas’
disease. In certain cases, a laparoscopically obtained
full-thickness biopsy specimen from the small intestine
may be required. Special staining techniques may be
needed to identify metabolic muscle disorders, including mitochondrial myopathy. Genetic testing is available
to assess for certain mitochondrial myopathies.
4. Identify complications of the motility disorder: bacterial
overgrowth, dehydration, and malnutrition. In patients
who present with diarrhea, it is important to assess
nutritional status (essential mineral and vitamin levels)
and to exclude bacterial overgrowth by culturing
small-bowel aspirates or performing breath testing.

Bacterial overgrowth is relatively uncommon in neuropathic disorders but is more common in myopathic
conditions, such as scleroderma, that are associated
more often with bowel dilatation or low-amplitude contractions. Bacterial overgrowth may be difﬁcult to detect
with culture of small-bowel aspirates; however, breath
hydrogen after a glucose or lactose load is a nonspeciﬁc
test that should be interpreted with caution and in conjunction with small-bowel transit time because the early
breath hydrogen peak may be due to bacterial metabolism of the substrate in the colon resulting from fast
small-bowel transit. Often, an empirical trial of antibiotic therapy is used as a surrogate for formal testing.

Treatment of Gastroparesis and Intestinal
Pseudo-Obstruction

Treatment should be designed for each patient, depending on
the ﬁndings of the investigation. The principal methods of
management include correction of hydration and nutritional
deﬁciencies, use of prokinetic and antiemetic medications,
suppression of bacterial overgrowth, decompression, and
surgical treatment.
Correction of Hydration and
Nutritional Deﬁciencies

Rehydration, electrolyte repletion, and nutritional supplementation are particularly important during acute exacerbations
of gastroparesis and chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction.
Restoration of nutrition can be achieved orally, enterally,

or parenterally, depending on the severity of the clinical syndrome. Initial nutritional measures include low ﬁber supplements with the addition of iron, folate, calcium, and vitamins
D, K, and B12. Patients with more severe symptoms may
require enteral or parenteral supplementation of nutrition. If
it is anticipated that enteral supplementation may be required
for more than 3 months, it is usually best to provide feedings
through a jejunostomy tube. Gastrostomy tubes should be
avoided in gastroparesis except for venting purposes. Many
patients who require long-term parenteral nutrition continue
to tolerate some oral feeding.
Medications

Medications may be used to treat neuromuscular motility disorders. However, there is little evidence that they are effective
in myopathic disturbances, except for the rare case of dystrophia myotonica affecting the stomach and for small-bowel
systemic sclerosis.
Erythromycin, a macrolide antibiotic that stimulates motilin receptors at higher doses (eg, 250–500 mg) and cholinergic
mechanisms at lower doses (eg, 40–80 mg), results in the
dumping of solids from the stomach. It has been shown to
accelerate gastric emptying in gastroparesis; it also increases

the amplitude of antral contractions and improves antroduodenal coordination. Erythromycin is most effective when it is
given intravenously during acute exacerbations of gastroparesis or intestinal pseudo-obstruction. The usual dose of intravenous erythromycin lactobionate is 3 mg/kg every 8 hours.
The effect of oral erythromycin appears to be restricted by
tolerance and gastrointestinal adverse effects, which often prevent treatment for longer than 1 month; sometimes a low dose
of liquid formula erythromycin (eg, 40–80 mg 3 times daily
before meals) can be tolerated. The elixir formulation may
improve absorption in the setting of dysmotility. Although
studies demonstrated that 2 weeks of treatment was effective
for patients with diabetic gastroparesis, there is little evidence
that continued therapy produces long-term improvement in
gastric emptying or associated symptoms.
Metoclopramide is a dopamine antagonist that has both
prokinetic and antiemetic properties. Antiemetic effects are
due partly to its anti-serotonergic3 (5-HT3) antagonist actions.
Long-term use of metoclopramide is limited by the adverse
effects of tremor and Parkinson-like symptoms, a consequence
of antidopaminergic activity in the central nervous system.
Occasionally, tardive dyskinesia can occur. This had led to
a recommendation that metoclopramide not be given for
longer than 3 months. It is available in tablet or elixir form

88

Section II Stomach

and typically is taken 30 minutes before meals and at bedtime.
Usual doses range from 5 to 20 mg 4 times daily.
Serotonergic (5-HT) agents may prove to be beneﬁcial
in the treatment of gastroparesis and intestinal pseudoobstruction. The combined 5-HT4 agonist and 5-HT3 antagonist, cisapride, was essentially the only medication for which
there was evidence for efﬁcacy in the medium- and long-term;
however, the medication is no longer available for prescription because of the risks of cardiac dysrhythmias (torsades de
pointes).
Octreotide, a cyclized analogue of somatostatin, has been
shown to induce activity fronts in the small intestine that
mimic phase III activity of the interdigestive migrating motor
complex. Activity fronts in the small bowel are characterized
by a simultaneous or very rapidly propagated activity front
that is not well coordinated. The clinical effects of octreotide
include an initial acceleration of gastric emptying, a decrease
in postprandial gastric motility, and inhibition of small-bowel
transit. Therefore, the therapeutic efﬁcacy of octreotide in
intestinal dysmotility associated with gastroparesis and pseudoobstruction requires further assessment in clinical trials. Currently, octreotide appears to be more useful in the treatment
of dumping syndromes associated with accelerated transit.
However, it may be used at nighttime to induce activity of the
migrating motor complex and to avoid bacterial overgrowth.
If required during the daytime, octreotide is often given in
combination with oral erythromycin to “normalize” the gastric emptying rate.
Antiemetics, including diphenhydramine, triﬂuoperazine,
and metoclopramide, are important in the management of
nausea and vomiting in patients with gastroparesis and intestinal pseudo-obstruction. The more expensive serotonin
5-HT3 antagonists (eg, ondansetron) have not proved to have
greater beneﬁt than the less expensive alternatives.
Antibiotic therapy is indicated for patients who have documented symptomatic bacterial overgrowth. Although formal
clinical trials have not been conducted, it is common practice
to use different antibiotics for 7 to 10 days each month in an
attempt to avoid development of resistance. Common antibiotics include doxycycline (100 mg twice daily), metronidazole
(500 mg 3 times daily), ciproﬂoxacin (500 mg twice daily),
and double-strength trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (2 tablets
twice daily). Antibiotic therapy for patients with diarrhea
and fat malabsorption due to bacterial overgrowth produces
considerable symptomatic relief.
Decompression

Decompression is rarely necessary in patients with chronic
pseudo-obstruction. However, venting enterostomy (jejunostomy) is effective in relieving abdominal distention and
bloating. It has been shown to decrease signiﬁcantly the frequency of nasogastric intubations and hospitalizations for
acute exacerbations of severe intestinal pseudo-obstruction in
patients requiring central parenteral nutrition. Access to the

small intestine by enterostomy also provides a way to deliver
nutrients enterally and should be considered for patients with
intermittent symptoms. The currently available enteral tubes
allow for aspiration and feeding by a single apparatus.
However, because venting can lead to displacement, some
patients need a feeding tube in the jejunum and a venting tube
in the stomach.
Surgical Treatment

Surgical treatment has a limited role in patients with gastroparesis and intestinal pseudo-obstruction. For patients who
have had multiple abdominal operations, it becomes difﬁcult
to discern whether exacerbations of symptoms reﬂect an
underlying disease or adhesions and mechanical obstruction.
Surgical treatment should be considered whenever the
motility disorder is localized to a resectable portion of the gut.
Three instances in which to consider this approach include
1) duodenojejunostomy or duodenoplasty for patients with
megaduodenum or duodenal atresia in children, 2) completion gastrectomy for patients with postgastric surgical stasis
syndrome, and 3) colectomy with ileorectostomy for intractable constipation associated with chronic colonic pseudoobstruction.
Novel Therapies

Preliminary data suggest that gastric pacing may improve gastric emptying and symptoms in patients with severe gastroparesis. In humans, gastric pacing has not been able to entrain
gastric slow waves to normalize gastric dysrhythmias or to
accelerate gastric emptying. Gastric electrical stimulation is an
approved treatment, but data on efﬁcacy are inconclusive and
additional controlled clinical trials are needed to assess the
long-term beneﬁts, complications, and optimal selection of
patients for this treatment.
Currently, small-bowel transplantation is limited to
patients with intestinal failure who have reversible total
parenteral nutrition (TPN)-induced liver disease or lifethreatening or recurrent catheter-related sepsis. Combined
small-bowel and liver transplantation is being performed in
patients with irreversible TPN-induced liver disease. Complications following small-bowel transplantation include infection, rejection, and lymphoproliferative disorders due to
long-term immunosuppression and Epstein-Barr virus infection. Studies have suggested that small-bowel transplantation
may improve quality of life and be more cost-effective than
long-term TPN. In the future, improvements in immunosuppressive regimens, earlier detection of rejection, and treatment
of cytomegalovirus infection based on polymerase chain reaction detection may enable small-bowel transplantation to
become the deﬁnitive treatment for short bowel syndrome or
severe pseudo-obstruction uncontrolled by TPN. In the meantime, parenteral nutrition is the treatment of choice for most
patients.

7 Gastrointestinal Motility Disorders

Functional Dyspepsia

Symptoms of dyspepsia such as epigastric pain or discomfort,
nausea, vomiting, early satiety, postprandial fullness, and
upper abdominal bloating are encountered commonly in clinical practice. Other chapters of this book review the role of
gastroesophageal reﬂux, peptic ulcer disease, gastritis, and
cancer in causing these symptoms. Yet, many patients still
have symptoms after testing and eradication of Helicobacter
pylori and a trial of acid inhibition, usually with a proton
pump inhibitor. These patients then undergo upper endoscopy, which usually produces negative ﬁndings, that is, no
ulcer, esophagitis, or cancer is found. When the symptoms last
longer than 3 months, the diagnosis of functional dyspepsia
can be made. Multiple potential pathogenetic mechanisms
have been postulated for functional dyspepsia (Table 7.3).
Similarly, many different therapies have been tried. This multitude of diagnostic and therapeutic options underscores the
fact that the cause of functional dyspepsia is not known.
Currently, there is no clear consensus about how best to
manage patients who have functional dyspepsia.
Deﬁnition

Dyspepsia is not a condition: it is a symptom complex.
Dyspepsia can be deﬁned as persistent or recurrent abdominal
pain or abdominal discomfort centered in the upper abdomen. The term discomfort includes symptoms of nausea,
vomiting, early satiety, postprandial fullness, and upper
abdominal bloating. Symptoms typically are associated with
eating but not with bowel movements. The symptoms of
heartburn and acid regurgitation are often included as symptoms of dyspepsia; yet, if they are the main symptoms, the
patient should be considered to have reﬂux rather than dyspepsia. Patients with symptoms or signs typical for biliary
tract or pancreatic disease should not be considered to have
functional dyspepsia. Thus, right upper quadrant pain or epigastric pain that radiates to the back should not be included in
the deﬁnition of dyspepsia.
Functional dyspepsia can be deﬁned as dyspepsia symptoms of more than 3 months’ duration without an anatomical
or biochemical abnormality. Typically, this means negative
ﬁndings on blood tests and a negative evaluation of the upper

gastrointestinal tract with either endoscopy or barium radiography. However, deﬁning endoscopy as “negative” can be
difﬁcult. Does this include biopsy study of the esophagus for
esophagitis or biopsy study of the stomach for gastritis or
H pylori infection? Are erythema, erosions, or histologic
inﬂammation meaningful ﬁndings? These issues are somewhat controversial.
Surveys have evaluated how many people in the community experience symptoms of dyspepsia. The rates vary in large
part because of the deﬁnitions used. Some surveys include the
symptom of heartburn in the deﬁnition of dyspepsia and
report a prevalence rate of 40%. Other surveys exclude subjects with symptoms of heartburn or irritable bowel syndrome
and report prevalence rates of less than 5%. Nonetheless, it is
reasonable to state that 15% (about one in seven) of the adult
population has dyspepsia. Not all these people with dyspepsia
have functional dyspepsia. In one study, a random sample of
the population with dyspepsia underwent endoscopy and only
53% had normal endoscopic ﬁndings. The remarkable ﬁndings were esophagitis, peptic ulcer disease, duodenitis, and
duodenogastric reﬂux. Of note, only 66% of the asymptomatic controls in this study had normal endoscopic ﬁndings!
Peptic ulcer disease and duodenitis were more common in the
subjects with dyspepsia than in the controls. Other ﬁndings
such as gastritis were found in a similar number of cases and
controls.
Pathophysiology

The most frequently mentioned etiologic possibilities for functional dyspepsia are listed in Table 7.3. The possible causes have
been divided into two camps: acid or H pylori vs motility. This
led investigators to try to identify speciﬁc symptom subtypes.
The idea was that even though the symptoms of dyspepsia
could result from multiple causes, reﬁning the symptom criteria would allow more speciﬁc causes to be identiﬁed. The most
recent diagnostic criteria for functional dyspepsia (Rome III)
introduced the terms epigastric pain syndrome and postprandial
distress syndrome in an effort to subclassify the condition.
Whether H pylori infection causes symptoms in the absence
of an ulcer is still debated. The prevalence of H pylori infection
and gastritis is only slightly more common in patients with
dyspepsia. Still, physicians, investigators, and patients have
been interested in the idea that the histologic inﬂammation
produces symptoms. In multicenter, placebo-controlled clinical trials, the effect of the eradication of H pylori on functional
dyspepsia has been small.
Patients commonly take antacids for relief of dyspepsia;
yet, gastric acid secretion is normal in patients with functional
dyspepsia. One hypothesis is that patients with functional dyspepsia may be more sensitive to acid. Placebo-controlled trials
have shown that acid suppression is modestly more effective
than placebo in functional dyspepsia. The question has been
whether this is due to occult gastroesophageal reﬂux that
manifests as dyspepsia.

90

Section II Stomach

Although clinicians often focus on epigastric pain as the
cardinal symptom of functional dyspepsia, most investigators
include other symptoms such as nausea, fullness, and early
satiety. These symptoms suggest that motor abnormalities
may have a role in causing this condition. Between one-third
and one-half of patients with functional dyspepsia who are
evaluated in gastrointestinal clinics of referral centers have
delayed gastric emptying. Multiple studies, primarily in
Europe, have evaluated the role of prokinetics in functional
dyspepsia. Generally, prokinetics are 30% more effective than
placebo, although the rates varied considerably among studies. Most of these studies were with cisapride or domperidone,
neither of which is currently available in the United States.
Metoclopramide may be helpful in part because of its antiemetic effects. Still, long-term treatment with metoclopramide
needs to be avoided because of the risk of tardive dyskinesia.
Whether a prokinetic efﬁcacious in treating functional dyspepsia will be available in the United States is not clear.
More recently, attention has shifted from gastric emptying
to gastric accommodation. Like the heart, the stomach has
both systolic and diastolic functions. Recent studies have
shown that gastric accommodation (ie, the relaxation of the
stomach in response to a meal) is abnormal in patients with
functional dyspepsia. Medications such as nitroglycerin, calcium channel blockers, and anticholinergics are being evaluated to determine whether they improve the accommodation
response. Currently, their effectiveness is not known.
The functional disorders are a continuum of illnesses characterized by gastrointestinal symptoms with negative diagnostic evaluations. There is signiﬁcant overlap among these
disorders. Speciﬁcally, at least one-third of patients with functional dyspepsia also have symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome. Patients with irritable bowel syndrome have been
shown to have a lower threshold for rectal distention. A similar phenomenon has been noted in functional dyspepsia for
distention of the stomach. More recently, imaging of the central nervous system has highlighted the activation of different
parts of the brain in subjects with functional gastrointestinal
disorders. Thus, the concept of visceral hypersensitivity
remains a strong consideration in all the functional gastrointestinal disorders, including functional dyspepsia. Currently,
however, no speciﬁc medication is available for visceral hypersensitivity, although new agents are being investigated. Clinically, low-dose antidepressants are being prescribed, although
there are not any formal clinical trial data.
Recommendations for Evaluation
and Therapy

Because of all the controversy from conﬂicting studies and
inadequate data, how is the clinician to proceed? Current
practice guidelines recommend either a trial of acid inhibition
or testing for H pylori infection before any diagnostic investigation for dyspepsia. Patients who remain symptomatic need
to undergo either upper gastrointestinal tract radiography
or endoscopy to exclude peptic ulcer disease, esophagitis,

and malignancy. After the diagnosis of functional dyspepsia
has been made, the ﬁrst step is to provide reassurance. Some
patients with functional dyspepsia want only to be assured
that they do not have cancer. They ﬁnd their symptoms tolerable and require no further intervention. The more difﬁcult
decision is whether to perform additional diagnostic testing.
The alternative is to proceed directly with empirical trials.
Often, the diagnostic tests can be interfaced with therapeutic
trials of H pylori eradication, proton pump inhibitors, prokinetics, mucosal protectants such as sucralfate, anticholinergics, or, ﬁnally, low-dose antidepressants. Some patients
prefer to consider herbal, hypnosis, or cognitive behavioral
psychologic therapy.
Between one-third and one-half of patients with dyspepsia
have symptoms that resolve spontaneously. Yet, some are
plagued by symptoms long term. It is hoped that newer medications directed at visceral hypersensitivity or gastric accommodation will be useful and strengthen the clinician’s
armamentarium against this common disorder.
Summary

Disorders of gastric and small-bowel motility may result in
either stasis or accelerated transit. Understanding the mechanisms that control motility and the pathophysiologic mechanisms is the key to optimal management. Simple, quantitative
measures of transit and an algorithmic approach to identifying
the underlying cause may lead to correction of abnormal function. Correcting dehydration and nutritional abnormalities and
providing symptomatic relief are important steps in the management of these patients. Patient education is essential to avoid
aggravation of symptoms caused by dietary indiscretions.

Answers

II.1. Answer e.
Patients who are about to be given treatment with aspirin or nonsteroidal antiinﬂammatory drugs long-term
are at increased risk for peptic ulcer disease and its complications if they also are infected with H pylori. Thus,
the H pylori infection should be eradicated. The risk of
peptic ulcer disease in these same patients without
concomitant H pylori infection can be reduced with
standard-dose proton pump inhibitor therapy, which
may be indicated if they are at high risk (ie, older than
60–70 years, previous history of peptic ulcer disease,
simultaneous use of multiple nonsteroidal antiinﬂammatory agents). Double-dose proton pump inhibitor
therapy would not be an initial choice, and H2-receptor
blocker therapy is not as effective in this setting. Misoprostol therapy would not be a good choice in this
reproductive-age woman because of its uterotropic
effects.
II.2. Answer d.
It is unlikely that this elderly woman has ZollingerEllison syndrome. Because of diabetes mellitus and
hypothyroidism, she is at risk for other autoimmune
disorders, such as pernicious anemia with vitamin B12
deﬁciency, macrocytic anemia, hypochlorhydria or
achlorhydria, and an appropriately elevated fasting
serum level of gastrin. A gastric pH study would be
useful and would exclude any consideration of ZollingerEllison syndrome with increased production of gastric
acid. Thus, the patient would not need a secretin stimulation test, endoscopic ultrasonography, or proton
pump inhibitor therapy. Because of her age and previous history of duodenal ulcer, serologic testing for H
pylori is likely to be positive; however, with pernicious
anemia and increased gastric pH, she is unlikely to have
an active infection.

96

II.3. Answer b.
Gastroduodenal ulceration has many possible causes
in persons who are negative for H pylori and do not
take aspirin or nonsteroidal antiinﬂammatory drugs.
Although all these causes need to be considered, idiopathic ulceration is the most common cause in an apparently healthy patient. Gastroduodenal ulceration often
is more difﬁcult to treat in these patients, and complications are more likely to develop.
II.4. Answer c.
The release of histamine in persons with systemic
mastocytosis increases the risk of peptic ulcer disease
by increasing gastric acid production. Somatostatin
is the major paracrine mediator that inhibits gastrin
release from G cells and acid secretion from parietal
cells. Misoprostol, a prostaglandin-containing medication, decreases gastric acid production. Dicyclomine
is prescribed as an antispasmodic agent for persons
with irritable bowel syndrome, and it has anticholinergic properties that decrease gastric acid
production. Persons infected with H pylori can have
increased (antral predominant), decreased (multifocal
or pangastric involvement), or normal gastric acid
production.
II.5. Answer c.
Success rates for the treatment of H pylori infection
have decreased in recent years from 85%–95% to
70%–85%. In some areas of the world with high rates of
resistance to clarithromycin, eradication rates may be
less than 70%. Patients who previously received treatment with clarithromycin or similar antibiotics may
have lower rates of H pylori eradication when clarithromycin is administered as part of a ﬁrst-line therapy
regimen.

Questions and Answers

II.6. Answer c.
This biopsy report is most consistent with lymphocytic
gastritis, which most often is associated with celiac disease, and hence, her symptoms. Biopsy of her duodenum is the best answer. Random colon biopsy
specimens could demonstrate microscopic colitis,
which is associated also with lymphocytic gastritis (as
well as celiac disease), but less often. She is unlikely
to have Crohn’s disease (answer b) or systemic lymphoma (answer d), and there is nothing to suggest
esophageal abnormality (answer e).
II.7. Answer e.
The clinical presentation suggests an inﬂammatory
disorder, with anemia and eosinophilia. Celiac disease
is unlikely with negative serologic ﬁndings. Giardiasis
could present with these symptoms, but eosinophilia is
not found. Similarly, eosinophilia is not seen with
amebiasis and is not typical of Crohn’s disease. Eosinophilic esophagitis (answer d) does not include diarrhea
or eosinophilia. Answer e is most likely because this
patient may well have eosinophilic gastritis. Both gastric and duodenal biopsy specimens can show patchy
areas of dense eosinophilic inﬁltration.
II.8. Answer b.
Evidence for overexpression of transforming growth
factor α, which may promote epithelial cell proliferation and diminish acid secretion, has been found in
patients with Ménétrier’s disease. Successful investigational use of monoclonal antibodies against the epidermal growth factor receptor has been reported in
these patients.
II.9. Answer d.
Nonsteroidal antiinﬂammatory drugs, aspirin, and
alcohol can injure the stomach and cause acute erosive
gastropathy. Nonsteroidal antiinﬂammatory drugs,
aspirin, and bile reﬂux often cause reactive gastropathy. In contrast, H pylori infection acutely causes a gastritis with prominent neutrophilic inﬁltration.
Streptococcal infections also can result in acute gastritis with neutrophilic inﬁltration, but this is much less
common than for H pylori infection.
II. 10. Answer b.
This patient most likely has gastric antral vascular
ectasia (GAVE). The appearance at endoscopy of diffuse patchy vascular lesions in the antrum, although
not described as the more typical linear distribution, is
consistent with GAVE. Portal hypertensive gastropathy or GAVE due to liver disease (cirrhosis) is not
likely the basis of this patient’s history. Answer a is
likely in both GAVE and portal hypertensive gastropathy, but neither condition results in an inﬂammatory inﬁltrate, erosions, or granulomas. Occlusion of

97

mucosal capillaries by ﬁbrin thrombi is characteristic
of GAVE.
II.11. Answer d.
H pylori infection of the stomach is considered a group 1
carcinogen; 90% of patients with gastric cancer have evidence of H pylori infection, which is widely considered
the single most important risk factor for gastric cancer.
II.12. Answer b.
Diffuse-type adenocarcinomas occur in association
with loss of expression of the cell adhesion protein
E-cadherin (CDH1) and have a less favorable prognosis than intestinal-type adenocarcinomas. Linitis
plastica lesions, which occur when diffuse-type adenocarcinomas spread extensively throughout the gastric
wall, and peritoneal carcinomatosis both portend an
ominous prognosis.
II.13. Answer c.
If lesions are localized and do not invade beyond the gastric mucosa and there is no spread to lymph nodes or
distant metastases, then patients are good candidates for
monotherapy (ie, antibiotics alone) aimed at eradication
of the underlying H pylori infection of the stomach.
II.14. Answer b.
Ninety percent of VIPomas are in the pancreas, and, in
part, because they are slow growing, they are fairly
large when discovered. VIPomas cause secretory diarrhea, and stool volume can exceed 3 L/day, resulting in
hypokalemia and dehydration.
II.15. Answer e.
The administration of anesthesia can provoke long
episodes of ﬂushing that can result in life-threatening
hypotension, known as carcinoid crisis. Carcinoid
crisis can be prevented by the administration of octreotide before anesthesia.
II.16. Answer c.
The best predictor of abnormal ﬁndings on gastroduodenal manometry is weight loss. People with known
motility problems do not require manometry. A transit study is sufﬁcient.
II.17. Answer b.
This patient likely has rumination syndrome. He
regurgitates after eating and can catch the food in his
mouth. The food is not yet acidic, and he can swallow
the food again if he chooses.
II.18. Answer a.
This older patient is unlikely to have acute onset of a
functional or motility disorder. First, obstruction must
be excluded. Her taking a nonsteroidal antiinﬂammatory drug makes ulceration near the pylorus or in the
duodenal bulb quite possible.

98

Section II Stomach

II. 19. Answer e.
This patient likely has functional dyspepsia. The key is
reassurance, but the ﬁrst step is a trial of acid suppression for the possibilities of reﬂux and ulcer. He does
not have alarm symptoms to warrant endoscopy at this
time.

II.20. Answer b.
Many people with diabetes have gastrointestinal symptoms. Not everyone has gastroparesis, but the delayed
vomiting makes this a possibility. This needs to be
documented because some people can have fast emptying and similar symptoms.

Clinical Features of Malabsorptive Disorders,
Small-Bowel Diseases, and Bacterial
Overgrowth Syndromes
Amy S. Oxentenko, MD

Malabsorptive Disorders and Diarrheaa

Malabsorption (defect in the mucosal absorption of nutrients)
and maldigestion (defect in the hydrolysis of nutrients) both
imply disordered physiologic mechanisms in the gastrointestinal system. Malabsorption and maldigestion of nutritional
substrates can occur in multiple phases: 1) the luminal phase,
in which there is contact between ingested food and various
digestive enzymes, 2) the mucosal phase, in which substances
are assimilated and absorbed in the required constituent form,
and 3) the delivery phase, in which nutrients are taken up into
the cytoplasm and transported to the lymphatics or portal
venous system (Table 8.1).
Carbohydrate Malabsorption

Starch, sucrose, and lactose account for nearly 85% of ingested
carbohydrates, with starches alone comprising 50%. For
starches to be absorbed, they ﬁrst are digested by salivary
α-amylase and pancreatic α-amylase—mainly the latter—into
disaccharides and oligosaccharides of maltose, maltotriose,
and α-dextrins, which are then hydrolyzed by brush border
enzymes to form the monosaccharide glucose. Sucrose is
hydrolyzed by sucrase to form glucose and fructose, whereas
lactose is hydrolyzed by lactase to form glucose and galactose.

Abbreviations: EATL, enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma;
PAS, periodic acid-Schiff; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; SIBO,
small intestinal bacterial overgrowth; tTG, tissue-transglutaminase
antibody

After being cleaved by the brush border disaccharidases, these
monosaccharides can be absorbed into the cytoplasm. Fructose
is transported by facilitated diffusion, but glucose and galactose are transported by a sodium-dependent active transporter
(SGLT-1); oral rehydration solutions are effective because of
the inclusion of both sodium and glucose in concentrations
that maximize use of this transport system (see below).
Carbohydrate malabsorption can be caused by either a
decrease in mucosal surface area (absolute or relative) or a
decrease in disaccharidases or transport proteins. Carbohydrates that are not absorbed increase the osmolality within the
intestinal lumen which then draws more ﬂuid into the lumen
to maintain an isosmotic state. Colonic bacterial fermentation
of these malabsorbed substances increases intestinal gas. The
most common clinical syndrome of carbohydrate malabsorption is from lactase deﬁciency. Congenital lactase deﬁciency is
present at birth and is rare. Primary lactase deﬁciency has a
delayed onset, with the highest prevalence among Native
Americans and people from sub-Saharan Africa and Asia. A
secondary, or late-onset, acquired lactase deﬁciency may occur
after intestinal resection, mucosal disease, or a postinfectious
syndrome. Because lactase is present on the microvillous surface, it is often the ﬁrst disaccharidase affected by small-bowel
mucosal diseases. Less common conditions associated with
disaccharidase deﬁciencies include sucrase-isomaltase deﬁciency (an inherited condition) and trehalase deﬁciency (trehalose is a sugar found in various mushrooms).
The clinical features of carbohydrate malabsorption include
odorless ﬂatus, bloating, and osmotic diarrhea. Weight loss
should not occur with isolated carbohydrate malabsorption. A
detailed dietary history can suggest the disorder. The diagnosis may be supported by the ﬁndings of an increased stool

osmotic gap and stool pH <6. Quantiﬁcation of the mucosal
enzyme activity of the various disaccharidases is invasive and
not widely available. Hydrogen breath tests have replaced oral
tolerance tests; an increase in breath hydrogen of 20 parts per
million above baseline is indicative of colonic fermentation of
the nonabsorbed carbohydrate by bacteria. If the test is positive and the patient has unfavorable clinical symptoms such as
bloating or diarrhea, this is indicative of malabsorption with
clinical intolerance. False-positive results (small intestinal
bacterial overgrowth [SIBO] or inadequate dietary instructions) and false-negative results (recent treatment with antibiotics or nonhydrogen producers) can occur with breath
testing. Tolerance to lactose-containing products can be
improved if they are ingested with other foods, especially in
amounts of less than 15 g (equivalent to 10 oz of milk).
Fat Malabsorption

Fat malabsorption is a complex process that requires adequate
function of the pancreas, liver, small-bowel mucosa, and lymphatic system. Triglycerides constitute the majority of dietary
fat. Initial lipolytic activity begins in the stomach through the
action of gastric lipase, although this contributes little to digestion in most people. Pancreatic lipase has a much larger role in
hydrolyzing dietary triglycerides. Because the optimal activity
of this enzyme is at a pH of 8, it is inactivated in acid overproduction states (eg, Zollinger-Ellison syndrome). Pancreatic
lipase hydrolyzes dietary triglycerides into free fatty acids and
β-monoglycerol. These constituents then combine with
conjugated bile salts from the liver to form water-soluble
micelles, which allow passage into enterocytes. At the level of

the enterocyte, triglycerides are reesteriﬁed, synthesized into
chylomicrons, and distributed systemically through the lymphatics. Although pancreatic function is required for fat digestion, a person may lose nearly 90% of lipase output from the
pancreas before the efﬁciency of fat digestion and absorption
is affected. Unlike long-chain triglycerides, which require bile
salts for absorption, medium-chain triglycerides do not
require micellar formation for absorption and can be absorbed
directly into the portal blood. This mechanism can be used to
provide triglycerides in the diet without worsening fat malabsorption in patients with bile salt deﬁciency.
The clinical features of fat malabsorption include diarrhea,
weight loss, and complications from fat-soluble vitamin deﬁciencies (vitamins A, D, E, and K). Although the amount of fat
in the stool can be assessed qualitatively with Sudan staining,
this test has relatively low sensitivity and speciﬁcity. Quantiﬁcation of fecal fat excretion is considered the “gold standard”
for establishing the presence of fat malabsorption. The normal
value for fecal fat excretion is less than 7 g/day, but patients
with diarrhea from any cause may have up to 14 g/day before
it may represent true fat malabsorption. A 72-hour stool collection is optimal; the patient should be placed on a diet containing 100 g of fat per day for several days before stool
collection commences.
Once fat malabsorption has been conﬁrmed, the cause
needs to be determined. In some cases, the cause may be
apparent clinically. The most common clinical conditions
result from small-bowel diseases or pancreatic insufﬁciency.
Although d-xylose testing has limited clinical availability, it
can help distinguish between a small-bowel and a pancreatic
source of fat malabsorption because d-xylose is absorbed

8 Clinical Features of Malabsorptive Disorders, Small-Bowel Diseases, and Bacterial Overgrowth Syndromes

normally by the small-bowel mucosa and excreted in the
urine. After ingestion of 25 g of d-xylose, a 1-hour serum or a
5-hour urine sample (or both) can be collected. A serum level
of d-xylose less than 20 mg/dL per hour or a urine concentration less than 5 g/5 hours suggests failure of small-bowel
absorption. Increased levels of d-xylose in the serum or urine
suggest that the small-bowel mucosa is intact, thus indicating
pancreatic insufﬁciency. Many factors can inﬂuence the test
results, including gastroparesis, vomiting, and inadequate collection of urine. Evaluation for small-bowel abnormalities
that can lead to fat malabsorption should include small-bowel
biopsies and cultures, as well as small-bowel imaging. To evaluate for pancreatic causes of fat malabsorption, imaging
(computed tomography, magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography, or endoscopic ultrasonography) can be used to
examine for changes due to chronic pancreatitis. Calciﬁcations seen in the pancreas on plain ﬁlms can be helpful, but
they are infrequent. Tests of pancreatic function are not widely
available but can be performed with secretin (to measure
bicarbonate) and cholecystokinin (to measure lipase or
trypsin). Alternatively, an empiric trial of pancreatic enzymes
can be recommended, with fecal fat quantiﬁcation before and
after the trial to assess objectively for improvement.
Protein Malabsorption

Protein digestion and absorption require adequate pancreatic
function and integrity of the intestinal mucosa. Ingested proteins are cleaved initially by pepsin (an endopeptidase), which
is produced from the precursor pepsinogen in response to a
gastric pH between 1 and 3, with inactivation at a pH >5.
When gastric chyme reaches the small intestine, enterokinase
from duodenal enterocytes activates trypsin. Trypsin then
converts pancreatic proteases from inactive to active forms in
a cascade fashion, subsequently cleaving proteins into various
amino acids and small peptides. Additional mucosal brush
border oligopeptidases further cleave small peptides, with free
amino acids and oligopeptides crossing into the cytoplasm
either freely or through carrier-mediated channels, some of
which are sodium mediated.
In addition to disorders that affect protein digestion and
absorption, there can be signiﬁcant loss of protein from the
intestinal tract; these conditions are referred to as proteinlosing enteropathies. Although the liver can respond to protein
loss by increasing the production of various proteins such as
albumin, a protein-losing state develops when net loss exceeds
net production. Three major categories of gastrointestinalrelated disorders are associated with excess protein loss: 1)
diseases with increased mucosal permeability without erosions, 2) diseases with mucosal erosions, and 3) diseases with
increased lymphatic pressure. Examples of clinical conditions
in each of these categories are listed in Table 8.2.
The clinical features of a protein-losing enteropathy include
diarrhea, edema, ascites, and possible concomitant carbohydrate and fat malabsorption, because isolated protein malabsorption or loss is infrequent. Laboratory studies may show a

low serum level of protein, albumin, and gamma globulins,
except for IgE, which has a short half-life and rapid synthesis.
If the protein-losing state is from lymphangiectasia (primary
or acquired), patients may also have lymphocytopenia. To
diagnose a protein-losing enteropathy, an α1-antitrypsin clearance test should be performed. α1-Antitrypsin is unique in
that it is neither absorbed nor secreted from the intestinal
mucosa, and unlike other proteins, it is resistant to proteolysis
(with the exception of pepsin). Therefore, its clearance reﬂects
a true protein-losing state. If a protein-losing gastropathy is
suspected (eg, Ménétrier’s disease), the patient should receive
acid-suppressive therapy before an α1-antitrypsin clearance
test is performed to avoid degradation of α1-antitrypsin by
pepsin.
Diarrhea

The mechanism for diarrhea is often from a combination of
decreased absorption (a villous function) and increased secretion (a crypt function). Diarrhea can be categorized in several
ways: inﬂammatory versus noninﬂammatory and secretory
versus osmotic. The clinical features of inﬂammatory diarrhea
may include abdominal pain, fever, and tenesmus. Stools may
be mucoid, bloody, smaller volume, and more frequent, unless
the small bowel also is affected diffusely. Microscopically, the
stools can contain blood and leukocytes. However, if the
inﬂammation is microscopic, these clinical and stool features
may be absent. Common causes of inﬂammatory diarrhea
include invasive infections, inﬂammatory bowel disease, radiation enteropathy, and ischemia. Noninﬂammatory causes of
diarrhea tend to produce watery diarrhea, without fever or
gross blood, and the stool appears normal on microscopy.
There are many causes, but infections, particularly by toxinproducing organisms, are common.

104

Section III Small Bowel and Nutrition

Distinguishing whether diarrhea is osmotic or secretory
can be useful clinically. Osmotic diarrhea is due to the ingestion of poorly absorbed cations, anions, sugars, or sugar alcohols (such as sorbitol or xylitol). These ingested ions obligate
retention of water in the intestinal lumen to maintain osmolality equal to that of other body ﬂuids (290 mOsm/kg); this
subsequently causes diarrhea. Osmotic diarrhea can occur also
from maldigestion or malabsorption (pancreatic insufﬁciency
or disaccharidase deﬁciency). The stool osmotic gap is calculated by adding the stool sodium and potassium concentrations, multiplying by two, and subtracting this amount from
290 mOsm/kg. A gap greater than 100 strongly supports an
osmotic cause for the diarrhea, whereas a gap less than 50 supports a secretory cause. Stool osmolality does not necessarily
need to be measured because the value should be the same as
that of the serum, with lower values indicating urine or water
contamination and higher values indicating that the specimen
was not processed readily. Stool volumes tend to be less with
osmotic diarrhea than with secretory diarrhea, and the diarrhea tends to abate with fasting.
For secretory diarrhea to occur, the primary bowel function converts from net absorption to net secretion. Normally,
up to 9 to 10 L of intestinal ﬂuid crosses the ligament of Treitz
each day and all but 1.5 L crosses the ileocecal valve, demonstrating the tremendous absorptive capacity of the small
bowel. The colon then absorbs all but 100 to 200 mL of the
ﬂuid, which is evacuated as stool. In secretory diarrhea, net
absorption converts to net secretion and the small bowel loses
its capacity to absorb the large volume of ﬂuid that it normally
does; thus, liters of ﬂuid pass into the colon daily. Although
the colon can adapt and absorb nearly 4 L of liquid from the
stool each day, larger ﬂuid loads cannot be absorbed, and this
results in large-volume diarrhea, often liters per day. Secretory
diarrhea does not abate with fasting. Dehydration can occur
easily, and replacement ﬂuids need to contain adequate concentrations of both sodium and glucose, as in oral rehydration
solutions, to maximize small-bowel absorption of sodium and
water. Sodium and glucose absorption from the small bowel
occurs through an Na-glucose transporter, SGLT-1. Characteristics, common causes, and testing strategies for secretory
and osmotic diarrhea are listed in Table 8.3.
Intestinal Resections and Short Bowel

Diarrhea and malabsorption can result from any process that
shortens the length of the functioning small bowel, whether
from surgery or from relative shortening caused by underlying
disease. Whether diarrhea and malabsorption occur with a
shortened small bowel depends on several factors: the length
of bowel resected, the location of the bowel resected, the integrity of the remaining bowel, and the presence of the colon. The
length and location of the resected small bowel affect the
enterohepatic circulation of bile. Typically, bile salts are reabsorbed from the terminal ileum. If less than 100 cm of distal
ileum is resected, the liver can compensate for the loss of
absorptive capacity by producing an increased amount of bile

salts, which enter the colon and cause a bile-irritant secretory
diarrhea. This diarrhea is treated with cholestyramine, which
binds the excess bile salts and improves diarrhea. If more than
100 cm of distal small bowel is resected, including the terminal
ileum, the liver can no longer compensate for the loss of
absorptive capacity. The resulting bile salt deﬁciency leads to
steatorrhea. This can be managed by prescribing a diet that
consists of medium-chain triglycerides, which do not require
bile salts or micellar formation for absorption because they are
absorbed directly into the portal blood.
The location of the small-bowel resection is also important.
The terminal ileum has the specialized function of absorbing
and recirculating bile salts and binding the cobalamin-intrinsic factor complex. When the jejunum is resected, the ileum is
able to assume all the functions of the jejunum. However, the
opposite is not true; the jejunum is not able to compensate for
the loss of the specialized functions of the ileum. Outcomes of

8 Clinical Features of Malabsorptive Disorders, Small-Bowel Diseases, and Bacterial Overgrowth Syndromes

ileal resection include diarrhea (from either an excess of or a
deﬁciency of bile salts, depending on length), vitamin B12 deﬁciency, SIBO (from resection of the ileocecal valve), gallstones
(from disruption of the cholesterol pool), and calcium oxalate
kidney stones. Normally, in the small bowel, calcium binds to
oxalate, and this passes into the colon and is excreted in the
stool. With a shortened small bowel and absence of the colon,
calcium preferentially binds to the fatty acids in the stool, leaving oxalate unbound. Unbound oxalate is incorporated into
the stool and excreted through the ostomy. In the case of a
shortened small bowel and intact colon, free oxalate is absorbed
from the colon, leading to the formation of calcium oxalate
kidney stones. Although the absolute length of small bowel
that is resected is important, the integrity of the remaining
bowel is crucial because diffuse pathologic processes such as
Crohn’s disease or radiation enteritis can result in a functionally shortened bowel without surgical resection. Whether a
patient has an intact colon is of considerable importance if
there has been prior small-bowel resection. The colon can
adapt by increasing water and sodium absorption, by acting as
an intestinal “brake” to slow motility, and by salvaging nonabsorbed carbohydrates to provide additional calories for
patients with short bowel syndrome.
In short bowel syndrome, multiple mechanisms contribute
to malabsorption. In the early postoperative stage, hypersecretion of gastric acid inactivates pancreatic enzymes, leading to
diarrhea and steatorrhea. Until the remaining small bowel has
time to adapt, intestinal transit is rapid because of the loss of
surface area. As mentioned above, patients may be at risk for
SIBO, and because of the disruption of the enterohepatic circulation of bile, bile acid wasting or steatorrhea (or both)
develop. Early management of short bowel syndrome includes
aggressive treatment with antidiarrheal agents, total parenteral
nutrition, and gastric acid suppression. Later management
includes the introduction of a low fat enteral diet, with

progressive increase in carbohydrates, medium-chain triglyceride supplementation as needed, lactose restriction, and
treatment of SIBO, if it is present or suspected.

Small-Bowel Diseases
Celiac Disease

Celiac disease may occur in genetically susceptible persons as
an immune response to gliadins in the diet. The prevalence is
highest among persons of European descent, and the disease is
being diagnosed with greater frequency in North America as
clinicians become more familiar with the many manifestations
of the disease. In the general population, the prevalence of
celiac disease is nearing 1:100. Among patients with any gastrointestinal symptoms, it is 1:56, and among ﬁrst-degree relatives of a patient with the disease, it is 1:22. Celiac disease
occurs in patients of all ages, but 20% are older than 60 years
at diagnosis.
The diagnosis of celiac disease can be made on the basis of
the following: 1) the presence of a clinical feature or features
compatible with the disease, 2) supportive serologic studies, 3)
characteristic small-bowel biopsy ﬁndings, and 4) a clinical
response to a gluten-free diet. The diagnosis no longer requires
rechallenging the patient with gluten to invoke symptoms,
because of the risk this presents to highly sensitive patients.
Patients with classic celiac disease have features of malabsorption, whereas those with atypical celiac disease tend to have
extraintestinal manifestations alone. These “atypical” forms of
celiac disease now represent the most common clinical presentations of the disease. The gastrointestinal and extraintestinal manifestations of celiac disease are outlined in Table 8.4.
The many diseases associated with celiac disease are listed in
Table 8.5.

The three most widely available serologic tests for evaluating patients for celiac disease are 1) anti-gliadin antibodies, 2)
endomysial antibodies, and 3) tissue-transglutaminase antibodies (tTG). The IgA-based tTG test is considered the single
best screening test for celiac disease. The anti-gliadin antibody
test has less sensitivity and speciﬁcity than other serologic
markers and is seldom used now. The various IgA-based serologic studies, including their sensitivity, speciﬁcity, and advantages or disadvantages, are listed in Table 8.6. A serum IgA
level is not necessary for ﬁrst-line screening for celiac disease
because of the relatively low prevalence (2%–3%) of IgA deﬁciency in patients with the disease. In patients with known IgA
deﬁciency, an IgG-based tTG should be performed; the sensitivity and speciﬁcity are both nearly 100%. However, this test

alone should not be used for ﬁrst-line screening in all patients
because the sensitivity of the test decreases to approximately
70% in non-IgA–deﬁcient patients. Serologic tests for celiac
disease should be considered for 1) patients with typical gastrointestinal manifestations of the disease, 2) patients with
atypical manifestations, 3) at-risk groups, and 4) patients who
are being followed for their response to a gluten-free diet. For
symptomatic patients, however, biopsy of the small bowel is

8 Clinical Features of Malabsorptive Disorders, Small-Bowel Diseases, and Bacterial Overgrowth Syndromes

needed regardless of the results of serologic testing. Also, any
positive serologic study needs to be conﬁrmed with smallbowel biopsy studies.
The endoscopic ﬁndings in celiac disease include loss of
mucosal folds, a mosaic pattern, scalloping, and nodularity.
The sensitivity of these endoscopic markers is quite poor;
however, if the markers are seen, small-bowel biopsy specimens should be obtained regardless of the indication for upper
endoscopy because of the high likelihood of demonstrating a
pathologic process. Small-bowel biopsy studies are required
for the diagnosis of celiac disease and should be performed in
all patients before treatment is initiated. The classic histologic
ﬁndings include villous atrophy (total or partial), crypt hyperplasia, intraepithelial lymphocytosis (>40 intraepithelial
lymphocytes per 100 surface enterocytes), and chronic inﬂammatory cells in the lamina propria (Fig. 8.1). There is a spectrum of histologic ﬁndings in celiac disease, as indicated by the
Marsh Classiﬁcation (Fig. 8.2). Early Marsh lesions are more
likely to produce fewer or no symptoms than late Marsh

107

lesions. An increase in the number of intraepithelial lymphocytes is the minimal histologic lesion needed for the diagnosis
of celiac disease; villous atrophy alone is not sufﬁcient for
diagnosis because it is a nonspeciﬁc ﬁnding. Other conditions
that may show villous ﬂattening in small-bowel biopsy specimens are listed in Table 8.7. These should be considered, especially if the results of serologic studies are negative.
Approximately 95% of patients with celiac disease are positive for HLA-DQ2, and the other 5% are positive for HLADQ8. However, 30% to 40% of the general population is also
positive for HLA-DQ2 or HLA-DQ8. Therefore, the presence
of one of these genetic markers is necessary but not sufﬁcient
for the diagnosis of celiac disease. HLA testing is not necessary
for most patients being evaluated for celiac disease; however,
the negative predictive value of 100% can be useful in evaluating 1) patients who have early Marsh lesions, 2) patients who
have negative serologic results, 3) patients who already have
been prescribed a gluten-free diet and are unwilling to reintroduce gluten in the diet, or 4) patients in certain higher risk

The only treatment for celiac disease is a lifelong glutenfree diet, which includes the avoidance of wheat, barley, and
rye. Food items that contain oats can be tolerated by most
patients with the disease, but cross-contamination or hypersensitivity may limit oat tolerability. Oats are generally avoided
for the ﬁrst year after diagnosis and then reintroduced if the
patient is doing well clinically. Consultation with a skilled
dietician is imperative for patients with celiac disease. Evaluating bone densitometry, determining vitamin and mineral
levels and providing replacement therapy, and vaccinating for
encapsulated organisms because of functional asplenia should
all be considered.

Dermatitis herpetiformis is an intensely pruritic papulovesicular rash, typically on the extensor surfaces, that represents
an intestinal sensitivity to gluten in the diet. Biopsy specimens
from the skin adjacent to the affected area may show granular
IgA deposits in the papillary dermis; these deposits are pathognomonic for dermatitis herpetiformis (Fig. 8.3). The treatment for dermatitis herpetiformis, as for celiac disease, is a
lifelong gluten-free diet. Dapsone may help with healing the
skin, but it does not heal the intestinal abnormality.
For patients with celiac disease in whom initial therapy fails
or symptoms recur after early clinical improvement, several
questions should be answered. First, was the initial diagnosis
of celiac disease correct? In this instance, the small-bowel
biopsies and supportive serologic studies should be reviewed.
Second, has there been inadvertent or surreptitious ingestion
of gluten? The ingestion of gluten is the most likely cause of
ongoing or recurring symptoms in a patient with celiac disease; thus, the patient’s diet and medications should be
reviewed. Also, patients with celiac disease are at risk for other
conditions that can cause diarrhea, and these should be considered: microscopic colitis, SIBO, pancreatic insufﬁciency,
lactase deﬁciency, and inﬂammatory bowel disease. Celiacspeciﬁc complications also need to be considered, including
ulcerative jejunitis, refractory sprue, and malignancy. Imaging
or small-bowel biopsy studies (or both) would be required.
Patients with celiac disease are at increased risk for enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma (EATL), which may be manifested as a recurrence of symptoms. EATL is associated with
poor survival. Compliance with a gluten-free diet can signiﬁcantly reduce the risk of EATL. Other malignancies for which

Small-bowel biopsy specimens typically contain periodic acidSchiff (PAS)–positive macrophages (Fig. 8.4). This needs to be
differentiated from Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare,
which in addition to being PAS-positive is acid-fast–positive.
Electron microscopy can be used to show sickle-shaped
T whippelii bacteria with their trilaminar cell wall. If the biopsy
specimens are PAS-positive and PCR is positive, the diagnosis
is established. A testing algorithm is provided in Figure 8.5.
Treatment for Whipple’s disease includes long-term treatment with antibiotics that penetrate the blood-brain barrier.
A randomized controlled study has found that 14 days of
intravenous therapy with either ceftriaxone or meropenem,
followed by 1 year of oral trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole,
is curative. Other therapies have had variable success, including doxycycline, hydroxychloroquine, and interferon-based
regimens.
Tropical Sprue

Tropical sprue may have features that are indistinguishable
from those of classic celiac disease, with diarrhea, weight loss,
anorexia, and lactose intolerance. Tropical sprue needs to be
considered if the patient has traveled to certain geographic
areas at risk, such as Asia, India, the Caribbean, and Central or

Whipple’s Disease

Whipple’s disease is a multisystem disorder caused by the
gram-positive bacillus Tropheryma whippelii. This disease
usually occurs in white males in the fourth and ﬁfth decades of
life. The clinical features include diarrhea, weight loss, adenopathy, arthralgias, fevers, carditis, hyperpigmentation,
pleural effusions, and ocular and neurologic symptoms. The
diagnosis can be established with a combination of smallbowel biopsy studies and the polymerase chain reaction (PCR).

South America. Acute tropical sprue has rapid onset of clinical
features and is independent of the length of stay in a tropical
area. In comparison, chronic tropical sprue has a more gradual presentation and requires several years of residence in a
tropical area. Physical examination may show evidence of
weight loss or cachexia, glossitis, and hyperactive bowel
sounds. Laboratory features can indicate megaloblastic anemia
with vitamin B12 and folate deﬁciency and a protein-losing
state. No speciﬁc test helps establish the diagnosis, and other
infectious disorders need to be ruled out. Small-bowel biopsy

specimens may show villous atrophy similar to that apparent
in celiac disease; therefore, for all patients with newly diagnosed celiac disease, the travel history needs to be documented,
especially if the serologic test results are negative. Treatment
with folate, 5 mg/day, and vitamin B12 replacement produces
rapid improvement in the anemia, glossitis, and weight loss in
many patients with tropical sprue. In addition, antibiotic therapy with tetracycline, 250 mg 4 times daily, may be needed in
combination with folate for 3 to 6 months, especially to treat
the chronic form of the disease.

111

Eosinophilic Gastroenteritis

Eosinophilic gastroenteritis has various clinical manifestations
depending on the location of bowel involvement. With mucosal
disease, patients often have diarrhea, malabsorption, and evidence of a protein-losing enteropathy. Involvement of the muscularis layer may lead to features of bowel obstruction, whereas
serosal involvement may lead to ascites and peritonitis.
Laboratory studies typically show an increased serum level
of IgE and peripheral eosinophilia, with a more marked
increase in the serum eosinophil count in patients with serosal
disease. However, a normal serum eosinophil count does not
exclude eosinophilic gastroenteritis. With the mucosal form
of the disease, the diagnosis is established with intestinal
biopsy specimens that show more than 20 to 25 eosinophils
per high-powered ﬁeld. With muscular or serosal involvement, a full-thickness biopsy may be required. Eosinophilia
found on ascitic ﬂuid analysis also can be suggestive. Parasitic
infections need to be ruled out before eosinophilic gastroenteritis is diagnosed. Also, eosinophilic gastroenteritis needs to
be differentiated from hypereosinophilic syndrome, which
is characterized by a serum eosinophil count greater than
1,500/mL (>1.5 × 109/L) for more than 6 months and multiorgan involvement.
An elimination diet may be incorporated in the treatment
program for eosinophilic gastroenteritis, although it has a limited role. Prednisone, 20 to 40 mg orally daily, often produces
a prompt clinical response, regardless of the layer of bowel
involved. Treatment with mast cell stabilizers, such as sodium
cromoglycate, and leukotriene receptor antagonists, such as
montelukast, has had variable success. Although budesonide
can be given in place of low-dose prednisone to patients who
require ongoing maintenance therapy, the controlled-release
formulation of this medication may not provide adequate
therapy to the proximal gastrointestinal tract.
Intestinal Lymphangiectasia

Intestinal lymphangiectasia occurs as either a primary or a
secondary form. Primary lymphangiectasia is characterized by
diffuse or localized ectasia of the enteric lymphatic system and
often is diagnosed at a young age. Secondary lymphangiectasia
occurs with conditions that produce impaired lymphatic ﬂow;
the causes are cardiac (congestive heart failure or constriction), neoplastic (lymphoma), or structural (retroperitoneal
ﬁbrosis).
Patients present with pronounced edema, diarrhea, nausea,
and vomiting; also, chylothorax and chylous ascites may be
present. Steatorrhea may be concurrent with a protein-losing
enteropathy. Laboratory ﬁndings include a decrease in the
plasma level of proteins and lymphocytopenia, which may
affect cellular immunity. Endoscopically, punctate white dots
may be seen on the bowel mucosa; histologic examination
shows marked dilation of the lacteals (Fig. 8.6). Abnormalities
of the lymphatics may also be assessed with contrast lymphangiography or nuclear scintigraphy after a high fat load.

Figure 8.6 Lymphangiectasia. Note dilated lacteals in several

contiguous villi.

The protein-losing state can be veriﬁed with an α1-antitrypsin
clearance test (described above).
Treatment for the primary form includes a low fat, high
protein diet and supplementation with medium-chain triglycerides as needed. If the disease is localized, resection could be
considered. For the secondary form, treatment should be
directed at the underlying disease process.
Amyloidosis

Amyloidosis is a multisystem disease that frequently involves
the gastrointestinal tract. Amyloid deposits can be found at
various levels of the bowel wall, although it usually is detected
in the submucosa. Amyloid also can be deposited in neuromuscular or perivascular sites. Patients with amyloidosis may
have diarrhea for many reasons. There may be delayed or
accelerated transit related to autonomic neuropathy, which
may lead to SIBO or bile acid malabsorption, respectively.
Also, the amyloid deposits may act as a barrier that prevents
proper absorption; patients can have a combination of fat,
protein, or carbohydrate malabsorption. They are commonly
lactose intolerant. The endoscopic ﬁndings in amyloidosis
include granularity, friability, and erosions, but often may be
normal. The yield of detecting involvement of the gastrointestinal tract by amyloidosis depends on the site from which
biopsy samples are obtained: esophagus 70%, stomach 75% to
95%, small intestine 85% to 100%, and colorectum 75% to
95%. A fat aspirate can be obtained for diagnostic purposes,
but this may have a lower yield than intestinal biopsies if there
is clinical suggestion of involvement of the gastrointestinal
tract. Congo red staining can show apple-green birefringence,
which is seen best in the walls of the vasculature if the biopsy
specimens contain lamina propria. Treatment for involvement of the gastrointestinal tract by amyloidosis includes
treating the underlying disease, but treatment for SIBO and
lactose avoidance should be considered.

112

Section III Small Bowel and Nutrition

Other Conditions

Miscellaneous

Scleroderma

Many other conditions are associated with diarrhea, malabsorption, and mucosal disease of the small bowel but cannot
be considered in detail here. Conditions to review include
immunodeﬁciencies (IgA deﬁciency, combined variable
immunodeﬁciency, and graft-versus-host disease), autoimmune enteropathy, collagen vascular diseases and vasculitides,
radiation enteritis, ischemia, mastocytosis, abetalipoproteinemia, and endocrinopathies (thyroid and adrenal).

Patients with systemic scleroderma may have diarrhea and
malabsorption from gastrointestinal disease. The diarrhea
may be due to ineffectual motility, which may lead to SIBO.
Also, intestinal pseudo-obstruction may occur with systemic
scleroderma. In addition, diarrhea may occur from decreased
mucosal blood ﬂow due to vasospasm. Treatment of
diarrhea in patients with scleroderma includes antibiotics for
SIBO and a lactose-restricted diet, as indicated. Treatment
with low-dose octreotide, 50 μg at bedtime, could be considered because it can help stimulate intestinal motility and
improve symptoms; however, octreotide can be prohibitively
expensive.
Diabetes Mellitus

Patients with diabetes mellitus may present with diarrhea or
malabsorption (or both) for various reasons. First, several oral
hypoglycemic agents are associated with diarrhea, such as
metformin and acarbose; the relation between the initiation of
treatment with these medications and the onset of diarrhea
needs to be determined. Second, delayed intestinal transit in
patients with diabetes puts them at risk for SIBO. Third,
because of the increased prevalence of gluten-sensitive
enteropathy among patients with type 1 insulin-dependent
diabetes mellitus, celiac disease needs to be considered.
Fourth, pancreatic insufﬁciency needs to be considered
because it may explain not only the diarrhea but also the
hyperglycemia. Fifth, patients with diabetes may ingest a
signiﬁcant amount of sugar-free substances for better glycemic control; these substances often contain sorbitol, xylitol, or
other sugar alcohols that may induce osmotic diarrhea. Sixth,
patients who have diabetes with end-organ involvement may
develop an autonomic neuropathy that will affect the gastrointestinal tract and lead to “diabetic diarrhea,” for which clonidine therapy may be helpful if the patient does not have
orthostatism.

Bacterial Overgrowth Syndromes

Normally, the small-bowel ﬂora contains a relatively small
number of bacteria (<103 organisms/mL), with a predominance of gram-positive organisms. In contrast, the colonic
ﬂora has a signiﬁcantly higher concentration of bacteria, which
are largely gram-negative and anaerobic organisms. When
there is stasis, altered motility, or loss of protective defenses in
the proximal intestinal tract, bacteria that are more representative of colonic ﬂora can overgrow in the small bowel and
result in a syndrome of diarrhea and nutritional deﬁciencies
known as small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO).
The many risk factors for SIBO are listed in Table 8.8, with
the principal causes associated with stasis of small-bowel contents or loss of protective gastric acid. Structural or surgical
changes in the bowel that produce relative stasis or reﬂux
of colonic ﬂora into the small bowel can be obtained from

Table 8.8

Dysmotility

Hospitalized Patients

New diarrhea or malabsorption in hospitalized patients has a
broad differential diagnosis that includes the following: antibiotics, Clostridium difﬁcile infection, tube feedings (based on
the location of the tube in the bowel, concentration of the formula, and bolus effect of the nutrition), elixir medications
(which contain sorbitol), magnesium (as in antacids or
replacement/supplementation), intestinal ischemia (especially
in critically ill patients), and fecal impaction with secondary
overﬂow. Also, any new medication started during the
hospitalization should be scrutinized as a cause of new-onset
diarrhea. Diarrhea that is long-standing or present before
hospitalization requires evaluation and work-up for chronic
diarrhea.

the history and radiographic imaging of the small bowel.
Any motility disorder that affects the small bowel (scleroderma, diabetes mellitus, or pseudo-obstruction) can lead to
stasis and overgrowth. Gastric acid is thought to be a protective barrier that keeps pathogenic bacteria out of the small
intestine; when there is loss of gastric acid, SIBO may ensue.
Advancing age alone may be a factor. In many patients, no
discrete risk factor is identiﬁed.
Symptoms of SIBO include abdominal pain, bloating, ﬂatulence, diarrhea, and weight loss. Malabsorption of fat, protein, or carbohydrates (or a combination of these) can occur
with secondary diarrhea. Fat malabsorption results from bacterial deconjugation of bile salts and leads to steatorrhea. Carbohydrate malabsorption can occur because of early sugar
breakdown and fermentation from bacteria as well as from
decreased disaccharidase activity caused by mucosal damage
and bacterial by-products. Mucosal damage is thought to have
a role in protein malabsorption because of the effect on oligopeptidase levels.
A classic pattern of laboratory ﬁndings in SIBO includes a
low serum level of vitamin B12 and an increased serum level of
folate. The low level of vitamin B12 is the result of the bacteria
cleaving vitamin B12 prematurely from intrinsic factor and
from the competitive binding and consuming of vitamin B12
by anaerobic bacteria. In this instance, results of the Schilling
test should normalize after the administration of antibiotics.
The increased serum level of folate is the result of folate synthesis by the intestinal bacteria. In addition to the above laboratory ﬁndings, there also may be low serum levels of iron,
protein, albumin, and fat-soluble vitamins, depending on the
degree of malabsorption.
The standard for making the diagnosis of SIBO is smallbowel cultures from direct aspiration, with more than 105
organisms/mL of aerobes and anaerobes being diagnostic.
Limitations of small-bowel cultures include availability, lack
of excess intestinal secretions for aspiration, and recent antibiotic therapy. Also, breath testing can be used to diagnose
SIBO, with lactulose hydrogen, glucose hydrogen, or
14
C-xylose substrates, in which an oral load of the substrate is
given and breath hydrogen concentration is measured every
15 to 30 minutes for 2 to 4 hours. An increase of more than
20 parts per million above baseline during the ﬁrst 90 minutes
is indicative of SIBO. An increase is seen again as these
substances reach the colon, thus producing a “double peak”
that also can be used as a criterion for diagnosis (Fig. 8.7).
False-positive results of breath testing can result from rapid
intestinal transit, in which the carbohydrate substance rapidly
reaches the colon and produces an early but not doublepeaked pattern. False-negative results of breath testing can
occur from recent antibiotic therapy. Also, the results will be
falsely negative in 20% of the population who are nonhydrogen formers. Breath testing results also can be affected by
recent laxative use, changes in diet, and smoking. Once SIBO
is diagnosed on the basis of cultures or breath testing, evaluating for predisposing conditions, for example, with smallbowel imaging, could be considered. Also, an empiric trial of

antibiotics could be considered for patients in whom testing
for SIBO may not lead to accurate results.
Treatment for SIBO lies in managing the symptoms and
replacing the deﬁciencies. Although modifying the underlying
risk factor (tighter glycemic control in diabetes patients,

114

Section III Small Bowel and Nutrition

surgery for patients with stricturing disease, and possibly octreotide for patients with scleroderma) that predisposes to
SIBO is feasible in only a small fraction of patients, it should
be considered. Vitamin and mineral levels should be measured
and deﬁciencies corrected before irreversible sequelae ensue
(eg, as with vitamin B12 deﬁciency). The role of antibiotic therapy is not to sterilize the small-bowel bacterial ﬂora, but rather
to decrease and modify the bacterial make-up so that it more
closely resembles the ﬂora that should be present in the small
intestine, with therapy targeting gram-negative and anaerobic
organisms. Various antibiotics have been used, such as
amoxicillin-clavulanate, ﬂuoroquinolones, rifaximin, tetracycline derivatives, and metronidazole. Initial treatment may consist of 7 to 10 days of an antibiotic, with repeated courses when
symptoms recur. Some patients may need monthly rotating antibiotic therapy. Also, lactose avoidance should be considered.

Nutritional Disorders: Vitamins and Minerals
Stephen C. Hauser, MD

Vitamins and minerals are critical to normal health because
they are essential to a vast assortment of metabolic functions.
This chapter focuses on selected important vitamins and
minerals and their relationships with gastrointestinal tract
disorders.

Water-Soluble Vitamins
Vitamin B12

Dietary intake of vitamin B12 (cobalamin) requires the ingestion of animal products (meat, dairy, ﬁsh, and shellﬁsh).
Although adults require only 2.4 μg/day, most adults in developed countries ingest 5 to 15 μg/day. Only slightly more
vitamin B12 is required during pregnancy (2.6 μg/day) and
lactation (2.8 μg/day). Because cobalamin is bound to animal
proteins, it must be released. Gastric contractions, gastric acid,
and gastric pepsins accomplish this function. Free vitamin B12
then binds to salivary and gastric R proteins (haptocorrins), a
process that is facilitated by the acid pH in the stomach. The
production and secretion of intrinsic factor by gastric parietal
cells are critical for the transfer of cobalamin from haptocorrins to intrinsic factor, which occurs in the duodenum and is
facilitated by pancreatic proteases (degradation of haptocorrins) and the more neutral pH of the duodenum. Finally, in
the terminal ileum, the cobalamin-intrinsic factor complex is
bound to speciﬁc receptors and vitamin B12 is absorbed into the
circulation, where it binds to transcobalamin II. About onehalf of the circulating vitamin B12 in cobalamin-transcobalamin
II is secreted into bile, of which one-half is recycled and the
other half is excreted in stool. Cobalamin in bile is bound to a
biliary haptocorrin, and this binding protein is then degraded
by pancreatic proteases in the duodenum, once again liberating
vitamin B12 for its binding to intrinsic factor. In healthy persons, overall about 70% of ingested cobalamin is absorbed.

Deﬁciency of vitamin B12 results in megaloblastic anemia
and hyperhomocystinemia, identical to that in folic acid
deﬁciency. In contrast to folic acid deﬁciency, vitamin B12
deﬁciency can cause neuropsychiatric abnormalities, including dementia, and disorders such as ataxia, paresthesia, chorea,
dystonia, subacute combined degeneration of the posterior
columns of the spinal cord (loss of lower extremity vibratory
and sometimes proprioceptive sensation), and loss of taste
sensation. Both vitamin B12 deﬁciency and folate deﬁciency
can cause glossitis, anorexia, and diarrhea. Serum methylmalonic acid levels (normal in folic acid deﬁciency) may
be increased (abnormal) before vitamin B12 levels are subnormal. Because large amounts of cobalamin (2.0-2.5 mg) are
stored in the body, especially in the liver, the lack of adequate
dietary vitamin B12 (eg, in a person who decides to be a true
vegan, without supplements) may take years to cause cobalamin deﬁciency. Achlorhydria is a common cause of vitamin
B12 deﬁciency in the elderly. Pernicious anemia is another not
uncommon cause of vitamin B12 deﬁciency because of the
lack of intrinsic factor and acid. In contrast to achlorhydria,
hyperacidity, as in Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, can disrupt
the duodenal phase of absorption (lack of more neutral
pH and inactivation of pancreatic proteases) of cobalamin
and result in cobalamin deﬁciency. Vitamin B12 deﬁciency
rarely occurs with pancreatic insufﬁciency itself or with
long-term treatment with acid-suppressive medications.
Bacterial overgrowth, infestation with Diphyllobothrium
latum, and ileal disease (Crohn’s disease and radiation enteritis) or resection also can result in vitamin B12 deﬁciency.
Often, gastric bypass surgery is complicated by subsequent
cobalamin deﬁciency (lack of intrinsic factor, acid, and gastric
grinding function). Pitfalls of the Schilling test include the
use of crystalline (not food-bound) cobalamin, which bypasses
the ﬁrst step in vitamin B12 absorption (release of cobalamin
from its food-bound state, as in elderly persons with achlorhydria), false-normal values, and abnormal ileal absorption

115

116

Section III Small Bowel and Nutrition

due to ileal macrocytosis (ongoing uncorrected cobalamin
deﬁciency).
Folic Acid

Folic acid has many dietary sources, including green leafy
vegetables, grains, orange juice, and organ meats. Adults
should ingest 400 μg/day of folic acid. In pregnancy, 600 μg/
day is recommended, and 500 μg/day is required during
lactation. Brush border membrane hydrolysis of dietary
folylpolyglutamates is followed by active transport of folylmonoglutamates, principally in the duodenum and upper
jejunum. Megaloblastic anemia, diarrhea (macrocytic enterocytes), glossitis, neural tube defects in newborns (maternal
folic acid deﬁciency in the ﬁrst 2 weeks of pregnancy), and
increased risk of colorectal cancer and cardiovascular disease
may occur from folic acid deﬁciency. Persons with dietary
deﬁciency of folic acid (body stores may last for up to 4
months), intestinal malabsorption states (small-bowel diseases, drugs such as sulfasalazine, phenytoin, methotrexate,
and alcohol), pregnancy, or chronic liver disease are at
increased risk for folic acid deﬁciency.
Other Water-Soluble Vitamins

Vitamin C deﬁciency (men require 90 mg/day, women 75 mg/
day, pregnant women 80 mg/day, lactating women 120 mg/
day) results in scurvy. Clinical features may include perifollicular hyperkeratotic papules and petechiae; swollen, red,
bleeding gums; or anemia. Persons who smoke require more
vitamin C (men 120 mg/day, women 110 mg/day). Severe
malabsorptive disease and chronic alcoholism increase the
risk of vitamin C deﬁciency. Vitamin C supplementation
enhances iron absorption and can increase the risk of adverse
cardiovascular events in persons with advanced iron storage
disease (hemochromatosis). Supplementation with more than
250 mg/day of vitamin C also can produce false-negative
results on fecal occult blood tests and increase the risk of
hyperoxaluria and kidney stones in persons with chronic renal
disease.
Thiamine (vitamin B1) deﬁciency can result in wet beriberi
with cardiac abnormalities (cardiomyopathy and high-output
failure) or dry beriberi with neurologic disorders (peripheral
neuropathy, cerebellar dysfunction, gaze pareses, or Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome), which may be exacerbated by the
administration of glucose to thiamine-deﬁcient patients.
Chronic alcoholism, overuse of diuretics, long-term renal
dialysis, pregnancy, malabsorptive disorders (including gastric bypass surgery), and chronic malnutrition all are risk factors for thiamine deﬁciency. A little more than 1.0 mg/day is
required. Thiamine is found in grains and pork.
Riboﬂavin (vitamin B2) deﬁciency can cause angular stomatitis, cheilosis, glossitis, seborrheic dermatitis, peripheral
neuropathy, and impaired vision. Chronic alcoholism and
malabsorptive disorders are risk factors. Fortiﬁed cereals,

milk, and eggs provide riboﬂavin. Slightly more than 1.0 mg/
day is required.
Niacin (vitamin B3) deﬁciency due to malabsorptive syndromes, chronic alcoholism, carcinoid syndrome, or isoniazid
therapy can produce pellagra (diarrhea, dermatitis, and
dementia), glossitis, cheilosis, dyssebacia, and angular stomatitis. Tryptophan, fortiﬁed cereals, legumes, and ﬁsh are
sources for niacin; between 14 and 18 mg of niacin equivalent
are needed daily. Excess niacin can cause ﬂushing and diarrhea and can worsen peptic ulcer disease. It also can lead to
hepatocellular injury.
Pyridoxine (vitamin B6) deﬁciency can occur in patients
receiving treatment with isoniazid, cycloserine, hydralazine,
oral contraceptives, dopamine, or d-penicillamine. Malabsorptive syndromes and chronic alcoholism also are risk factors. Glossitis, cheilosis, angular stomatitis, seborrheic
dermatitis, sideroblastic anemia, seizures, and peripheral neuropathy may supervene. Vitamin B6 deﬁciency may be responsible for both the limited increase in aminotransferase values
and the increased ratio of aspartate aminotransferase to alanine aminotransferase in alcoholic hepatitis. Pyridoxine
occurs in meat, ﬁsh, fortiﬁed cereals, and noncitrus fruit.
Between 1.3 and 2.0 mg is required daily. Massive doses may
cause sensory neuropathy.
Although biotin deﬁciency is rare, it can occur in patients
receiving total parenteral nutrition without biotin supplementation. Altered mental status, metabolic acidosis, and seborrheic dermatitis may occur.

Fat-Soluble Vitamins
Vitamin A

As with other fat-soluble vitamins, the absorption of vitamin
A requires luminal bile salts and pancreatic esterases, assembly
into chylomicrons, and lymphatic transport. Lack of vitamin
A can produce night blindness, xerophthalmia, a follicular
hyperkeratotic rash, abnormalities of taste and smell, bone
and muscle pain, and increased risk of infections. Liver disease
may be accompanied by vitamin A deﬁciency, especially alcoholic liver disease. However, persons with alcoholic liver disease and vitamin A deﬁciency who receive vitamin A
supplementation are at risk for hepatotoxicity. Similar to
other fat-soluble vitamins, excess vitamin A can cause toxicity
(liver failure, increased cerebrospinal ﬂuid pressure, desquamating rash, alopecia, or hypercalcemia).
Vitamin D

Adequate vitamin D levels are achieved with diet, dietary supplementation, and sunlight. Liver disease and kidney disease,
as well as malabsorptive conditions, are the major risk factors
for vitamin D deﬁciency. Excess vitamin D can result in
anorexia, nausea, vomiting, constipation, confusion, and

9 Nutritional Disorders: Vitamins and Minerals

abdominal pain (hypercalcemia), and polyuria and kidney
stones (hypercalciuria).
Vitamin E

Malabsorptive disorders and particularly chronic cholestasis in
children are major risk factors for vitamin E deﬁciency.
Manifestations of vitamin E deﬁciency include neurologic symptoms (posterior column disease, peripheral neuropathy, and
brainstem and cranial nerve damage), retinal disease, and hemolysis. High doses of vitamin E may cause coagulation disorders.

117

Iron deﬁciency can result in microcytic hypochromic
anemia, altered immune function, angular stomatitis, koilonychia, and atrophic lingual papillae. Lack of dietary iron,
increased gastrointestinal loss of iron (bleeding), poor absorption of iron (upper small-bowel mucosal dysfunction as in
celiac disease), bypass of the upper small bowel (gastrojejunal
bypass surgery), gastric resection and achlorhydria, and persistent ingestion of iron-binding compounds (soil or laundry
starch) can all contribute to iron deﬁciency. (Iron overload is
discussed in Chapter 29, Metabolic Liver Disease.)
Zinc

Vitamin K

Vitamin K is acquired from exogenous dietary (green leafy
vegetables) and endogenous (intestinal bacteria) sources.
Malabsorptive syndromes, dietary inadequacy, and antibiotic
administration are risk factors for vitamin K deﬁciency. Factor
VII usually is the rate-limiting factor for normal prothrombin
time (or the international normalized ratio). Excessive doses
of vitamin E can interfere with vitamin K-dependent metabolism, resulting in hemorrhage.

Minerals
Iron

Loss of endogenous iron from the gastrointestinal tract (usually 1.0-2.0 mg/day), urinary tract, and skin and menstrual
loss in women needs to be matched by iron absorption from
the duodenum and upper jejunum. Men and postmenopausal
women require 8 mg/day, and premenopausal women require
15 to 18 mg/day. Iron contained in the form of heme from
meat is absorbed (up to 25%) more readily than inorganic
ferric iron salts (3%–10%). Gastric grinding, gastric acid, and
gastric ascorbate help make ferric iron compounds more soluble. Ferric reductase (duodenal cytochrome B) on the brush
border and ascorbate reduce inorganic iron from the ferric
(Fe3+) to the ferrous (Fe2+) form. An iron transporter, divalent
metal transporter 1, also on the brush border, facilitates the
absorption of ferrous iron. This same transporter also can
facilitate the absorption of divalent copper, zinc, lead, and
manganese, each of which can compete with and inhibit the
absorption of divalent iron. Ferroportin 1 with ferroxidase
hephaestin (both located on the basolateral membrane) transports iron into the circulation, oxidize it to the ferric form,
and allow it to bind to apotransferrin, forming transferrin.
The liver produces hepcidin, which regulates iron transport
through its interactions with ferroportin 1, decreasing iron
absorption. The basolateral membrane transferrin receptor,
under regulation by the hemochromatosis gene HFE, allows
intestinal cell reuptake of iron from transferrin. Normally,
with adequate total body iron stores, up to about 10% of
dietary inorganic iron can be absorbed. With iron deﬁciency,
this may increase to 30%.

Zinc is required as a cofactor for many enzymes (eg, alkaline
phosphatase), and its deﬁciency impairs growth, development, and reproductive and immune functions. Between
8 and 14 mg is required daily. Meat and seafood are good
sources. Chronic diarrhea, short bowel syndrome, cystic ﬁbrosis, pancreatic insufﬁciency, cirrhosis, alcoholism, chronic
renal failure, anorexia nervosa, pregnancy, sickle cell anemia,
and use of the drug d-penicillamine are risk factors for zinc
deﬁciency. A scaly red rash involving the face, groin, and
hands may occur with zinc deﬁciency itself or as a result of the
autosomal recessive disorder of zinc metabolism, acrodermatitis enteropathica. Alopecia, loss of taste sensation, growth
retardation, poor wound healing, hypogonadism, diarrhea,
and night blindness also may occur from zinc deﬁciency.
Excess zinc intake (eg, supplements such as those used to treat
Wilson’s disease) can cause copper deﬁciency.
Copper

Copper occurs in meat, nuts, and grains. Nearly 1 mg is
required daily. Copper deﬁciency can result in microcytic
hypochromic anemia, leukopenia, neutropenia, infections,
diarrhea, neurologic disturbances, hypopigmentation of the
skin and hair, and bony changes. Clinical conditions in adults
that predispose to copper deﬁciency include total parenteral
nutrition without copper supplementation, malabsorptive
syndromes, and chronic biliary ﬁstulas. Excess supplemental
zinc or iron can decrease copper absorption. Toxicity from
excess administration of oral copper includes acute hemorrhagic gastritis.
Phosphorus

Phosphorus deﬁciency is common in patients with malnutrition, malabsorptive disorders, and alcoholism and in refeeding
syndrome. Cardiac failure, hemolytic anemia, rhabdomyolysis,
acidosis, and encephalopathy may develop with phosphorus
deﬁciency.
Miscellaneous Minerals

Deﬁciencies of selenium (cardiomyopathy and myositis),
chromium (hyperglycemia and neurologic symptoms),

118

Section III Small Bowel and Nutrition

manganese (night blindness, tachycardia, tachypnea, headache, and vomiting), or molybdenum (neurologic symptoms)
may develop in patients receiving long-term total parenteral
nutrition or tube feeding without proper supplementation.
Bariatric Surgery

Metabolic complications should be anticipated after bariatric
surgery. Protein malnutrition can cause hair loss, as can zinc
deﬁciency. Deﬁciencies of vitamins D, A, E, and B12, and thiamine, folate, iron, and copper may occur if supplementation
and monitoring are deﬁcient.

III.1. A 52-year-old woman with a history of acute leukemia
who had a bone marrow transplant 6 months earlier
presents with a 1-month history of diarrhea. She has
ﬁve to seven loose bowel movements daily, including
nocturnal stools. There has been no obvious blood or
melena. She says she does not have signiﬁcant bloating
or ﬂatus. She has had progressive bilateral swelling of
her legs and the development of ascites over the past
few weeks. She has gained 15 lb of weight over the last
2 weeks alone. She also has a new nonpruritic skin
rash, with erythema and plaque-like changes diffusely.
Other than the ﬁndings above, physical examination
results are normal. Laboratory tests show the following: normal complete blood count and electrolytes and
mild increase in alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin
levels. The serum albumin level is 2.1 g/dL (normal
3.5–5.0 g/dL), and total protein is 4.0 g/dL (normal
6.0–8.5 g/dL). The prothrombin time/INR and 25-OH
vitamin D level are normal. Stool cultures, including an
evaluation for Clostridium difﬁcile, have been negative.
Esophagogastroduodenoscopy and colonoscopy show
mild diffuse erythema alone, with small-bowel biopsy

III.2. Six months ago, celiac disease was diagnosed in a
45-year-old woman when she sought evaluation for
diarrhea and bloating. At the time of diagnosis, laboratory values were notable for AST 156 U/L (normal
8-43 U/L), ALT 171 U/L (normal 7-45 U/L), and alkaline phosphatase 115 U/L (normal 37-98 U/L), with
normal values for total and direct bilirubin. Because
the vitamin D level was low, the patient started receiving supplementation. She met with a dietician to
review a gluten-free diet. She has returned for 6-month
follow-up. Now, laboratory values are AST 132 U/L,
ALT 147 U/L, and alkaline phosphatase 72 U/L, with
normalization of tissue transglutaminase antibodies,
which initially were increased. Findings on right upper
quadrant ultrasonography are normal. She claims to
be compliant with the gluten-free diet. Which of the
following is the next best step?
a. Perform magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography
b. Check for antinuclear and smooth muscle antibodies
c. Check for antimitochondrial antibodies
d. Recheck vitamin D level
e. Repeat consultation with dietician
III.3. A 64-year-old man recently had resection of 350 cm of
small bowel for acute mesenteric ischemia. Since surgery, he has had frequent, voluminous diarrhea. He is
being maintained on total parenteral nutrition and
is beginning to supplement this with oral intake. He
is receiving high-dose loperamide and diphenoxylate

III.4. A 30-year-old man presents for evaluation of bloating
and diarrhea that occurs every time his mother makes
his favorite mushroom soufﬂe. In between these episodes, he does well and has no bowel complaints.
Because the soufﬂe contains milk, he attempted a
4-week trial of dairy avoidance, during which he felt
ﬁne. The next time his mother made the soufﬂe, she
used lactose-free milk. Despite this, the patient still
had signiﬁcant bloating, ﬂatulence, and diarrhea after
the meal. Which is the most likely explanation for his
symptoms?
a. Decreased micelle formation
b. Transporter defect
c. Disaccharidase deﬁciency
d. Absence of enterokinase
e. Increased lymphatic pressure
III.5. A 72-year-old woman had open cholecystectomy
3 days ago because of recurrent biliary colic. Preoperatively, she had no bowel complaints and had one
formed bowel movement daily. Since surgery, she has
had four to six loose bowel movements during the day
associated with excess bloating. She says she does not
have nocturnal stools. Her only signiﬁcant past medical history is gastroesophageal reﬂux, for which she
takes a proton pump inhibitor daily. Since she has
been in the hospital, she has had some breakthrough
heartburn and has been given an antacid several times
a day. Stool cultures in the hospital have been negative, including for Clostridium difﬁcile. The intern on
call ordered serum gastrin measurement, which was
317 pg/mL (normal <100 pg/mL). Stool sodium was
45 mmol/L; stool potassium was 25 mmol/L. Which of

III.6. A 36-year-old woman presents with fatigue, dyspnea
on exertion, diarrhea, paresthesias, and difﬁculty
walking. Several years ago she had Roux-en-Y gastric
bypass for morbid obesity and has lost nearly 100 lb in
weight. She has been receiving parenteral vitamin B12
injections regularly. Last year, microcytic hypochromic anemia was diagnosed, and she has been receiving
oral iron supplementation. An ataxic gate is noted on

physical examination. A complete blood count again
shows microcytic hypochromic anemia and mild
leukopenia. Which of the following is most likely to
explain this patient’s presentation?
a. Vitamin E deﬁciency
b. Vitamin B12 deﬁciency
c. Copper deﬁciency
d. Iron deﬁciency
e. Thiamine deﬁciency
III.7. A 71-year-old man underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy for symptomatic cholelithiasis. Postoperative complications included a biliary leak and

external biliary drainage for 5 years. Which of the
following is most likely?
a. Vitamin C deﬁciency
b. Vitamin B12 deﬁciency
c. Copper deﬁciency
d. Zinc deﬁciency

Answers

III.1. Answer d.
This patient has features of chronic GVHD, with skin,
liver, and gastrointestinal tract involvement. Her major
complaint currently is the diarrhea and edema that have
developed, likely due to the intestinal involvement creating a protein-losing enteropathy. An α1-antitrypsin
clearance test can be used to document the protein-losing state. Although patients with GVHD may also
develop fat malabsorption, this patient does not have
signiﬁcant weight loss or laboratory features of fat-soluble vitamin deﬁciencies; thus, a 72-hour fecal fat collection is not needed at this time. This patient may have
concomitant carbohydrate malabsorption; however, the
lack of bloating or excess ﬂatus and the secretory nature
of the diarrhea make breath testing less imperative as
next-line testing. Lymphatic scintigraphy can help evaluate protein-losing enteropathy due to lymphoma or
other lymphatic abnormalities, which does not appear
to be the case here. Amyloidosis can cause a proteinlosing enteropathy (in which Congo red staining may be
helpful), but this patient has another more obvious
reason to have a protein-losing state with GVHD.
III. 2. Answer b.
Celiac disease is associated with several liver conditions,
including autoimmune hepatitis, primary sclerosing
cholangitis, and primary biliary cirrhosis. Also, some
patients with celiac disease have nonspeciﬁc liver ﬁndings related to gluten in the diet. This patient may very
well have autoimmune hepatitis, the liver condition seen
most commonly with celiac disease, because of the lack
of normalization on a gluten-free diet and the hepatitic
pattern. Next, it would be helpful to check for antinuclear and smooth muscle antibodies. Although initially
the alkaline phosphatase level was increased, it subsequently normalized, suggesting the increase may have

122

been due to vitamin D deﬁciency (resulting in osteomalacia), which corrected with supplementation. Because
there is no evidence of ongoing cholestasis, antimitochondrial antibodies and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography would not be necessary at this time.
Although it may not be wrong to recheck a vitamin D
level after 6 months of supplementation, it would not
help explain the persistently abnormal liver tests. Because
the patient states she adheres to a gluten-free diet and
tissue transglutaminase antibodies have normalized,
there is no need to consult a dietician at this time.
III.3. Answer a.
Early postoperative management for patients with shortened bowel includes aggressive treatment with antidiarrheal agents and total parenteral nutrition, as this patient
is receiving. In addition, gastric acid suppression is
essential because of the hypersecretion of gastric acid in
the early postoperative period, which leads to pancreatic
lipase inactivation, resulting in diarrhea and steatorrhea.
Because this patient has had more than 100 cm of small
bowel resected and likely has bile salt deﬁciency, he
needs to be considered for supplementation with medium-chain triglycerides (not long-chain), which do not
require bile salts and micelle formation for absorption.
Similarly, adding cholestyramine would not be recommended because it would bind the few remaining bile
salts that are recirculating, worsening his diarrhea. Elixirs contain sorbitol and other sugar alcohols that can
cause diarrhea due to the increased osmotic load; so this
would not be recommended at this time unless the
patient was unable to take any pills orally. The patient
should be taking oral rehydration solution and should
be instructed in its use; it contains sodium and glucose
to aid in ﬂuid absorption. Excess free water intake may
actually worsen the diarrhea.

Questions and Answers

III.4. Answer c.
This patient likely has trehalase deﬁciency. Trehalase is a
disaccharidase that helps break down trehalose, which is
found in mushrooms. This disaccharidase deﬁciency
may be hereditary or acquired. Although less common
than lactase deﬁciency in the United States, it is seen
with increased prevalence in certain areas (Greenland).
Decreased micelle formation may be seen in liver disease, biliary obstruction, and ileal resection or it may be
due to certain medications, but none of these are apparent here. Transporter defects can result in certain conditions such as cystinuria or Hartnup disease. Enterokinase
deﬁciency would result in chronic diarrhea, clearly more
often than what the patient is experiencing. Increased
lymphatic pressure can result in impaired delivery of
micronutrients, but this would not be speciﬁc for mushrooms or any other food product.
III.5. Answer e.
The patient has new-onset diarrhea since being hospitalized. She is being given an antacid several times a day,
and a number of antacids contain magnesium, which
can cause an osmotically driven diarrhea. This diagnosis
is supported by the osmolar gap seen with the stool
studies, as based on the following calculation: 290 – 2
(45 + 25) = 150. A gap of more than 100 supports the
diagnosis of osmotic diarrhea. Although lactase deﬁciency is the most common cause of osmotic diarrhea, it
would be unusual for this to develop suddenly after
cholecystectomy. If the patient had recently undergone
a small-bowel resection or had an enteric infection,
lactase deﬁciency could have developed acutely, but she
had neither of these. Stool cultures negative for C difﬁcile, no nocturnal stools, and an osmotic gap make
another diagnosis more likely. In cases with limited
small-bowel resections or biliary decompression, excess
bile acids can irritate the colon and cause a secretory
diarrhea, which this patient does not have. Although the
patient’s gastrin level is increased, it is much more likely
to be from the proton pump inhibitor therapy than
from gastrinoma, especially because the diarrhea is
acute.
III.6. Answer c.
Iron deﬁciency typically causes hypochromic microcytic
anemia, with fatigue and dyspnea on exertion, but not
neurologic ﬁndings. In addition, the anemia has not
responded to iron supplementation. The neurologic
symptoms could be due to vitamin B12 deﬁciency but
not anemia. Furthermore, this patient has been regularly receiving vitamin B12 parenterally. Vitamin E deﬁciency and thiamine deﬁciency can result in neurologic
symptoms but not in hypochromic microcytic anemia.

123

Copper deﬁciency is not rare after gastric bypass surgery and can result in anemia similar to the anemia of
iron deﬁciency and neurologic manifestations similar
to those found in vitamin B12 deﬁciency.
III.7. Answer b.
Because the enterohepatic circulation is essential for
vitamin B12 metabolism, an external biliary ﬁstula can
result in vitamin B12 deﬁciency over 5 years. Copper
and zinc deﬁciency are unlikely with external biliary
drainage. Vitamin C is a water-soluble vitamin, and,
unlike vitamins K, A, D, and E, does not require bile
salts in the upper small bowel for its absorption. With
steatorrhea due to lack of bile salts in the upper small
bowel, oxalate is hyperabsorbed by the colon, and this
can result in hyperoxaluria and kidney stones.
III.8. Answer b.
This previously healthy patient most likely has vitamin
B12 deﬁciency due to hypochlorhydria of aging, with an
increased serum level of methylmalonic acid, which is
not found with folate deﬁciency. The Schilling test is
normal because crystalline cobalamin, which is used
for this test, bypasses the ﬁrst step in vitamin B12
absorption (release of cobalamin from its food-bound
state, which often is abnormal in elderly patients with
hypochlorhydria). Hypothyroidism and pyridoxine
deﬁciency do not cause either macrocytic anemia or
increased serum levels of methylmalonic acid. Bacterial overgrowth can cause vitamin B12 deﬁciency, but
the Schilling test would be abnormal and serum folate
levels would more often be increased and not decreased.
Serum levels of homocysteine increase with both vitamin B12 deﬁciency and folate deﬁciency.
III.9. Answer e.
The administration of total parenteral nutrition without lipid can result in deﬁciency of the essential fatty
acids linoleic acid and linolenic acid and a red, scaly
rash. Choline, carnitine, and arginine would not be
deﬁcient in an adult with pancreatitis, nor would
eicosapentaenoic acid, a constituent of ﬁsh oil.
III.10. Answer b.
This cachectic alcoholic patient now receiving enteral
nutrition most likely is experiencing increased weakness and congestive heart failure because of refeeding
syndrome. Typically, the serum levels of phosphorus,
potassium, and magnesium decrease. Hypernatremia
and hypocalcemia would not be expected. Thiamine
deﬁciency would be included in the differential diagnosis, but it is likely that this patient would have been
receiving parenteral thiamine since admission to the
hospital.

Gastrointestinal Manifestations of Human
Immunodeﬁciency Virus Infection
Stephen C. Hauser, MD

Nearly 70 million people worldwide have been infected with
human immunodeﬁciency virus (HIV) type 1, and more than
35 million have died from complications of the infection. More
than 1 million persons in the United States have been infected
with HIV. Highly active antiretroviral therapies (HAARTs)
with multiple drugs—now widely used in the United States
and highly effective—have greatly diminished the incidence of
opportunistic infections in patients infected with HIV.
Suppression of viral load to less than 50 copies/mL and maintenance of adequate CD4 lymphocyte counts (>500/μL
[0.5×109/L]) are crucial. Opportunistic infections and malignancies are uncommon in HIV-infected patients with plasma
HIV viral loads less than 10,000 copies/mL and CD4 counts
greater than 200 to 500/μL (0.2-0.5×109/L). However, because
of cost, compliance, lack of availability of treatment in certain
parts of the world, drug resistance, drug toxicity, and drugdrug and drug-alternative substance interactions, not all
patients with HIV infection receive adequate therapy. Also, in
up to 25% of persons in the United States infected with HIV,
the infection is undiagnosed. In immunosuppressed HIVinfected patients, multiple infections often occur simultaneously. Presentations may be typical or atypical, and there is
great overlap in clinical signs and symptoms between infections and malignancies. In patients with successfully treated
HIV infection, gastrointestinal disorders are more likely to be
similar to those in non–HIV-infected and otherwise healthy
persons (eg, dysphagia due to gastroesophageal reﬂux disease
a

herpes simplex virus

rather than an opportunistic infection). Opportunistic infections that previously were difﬁcult to treat in immunosuppressed HIV-infected patients (ie, Cryptosporidium and
Microsporida infections) may resolve with successful HAART.
Adverse effects of antiretroviral therapy involving the gastrointestinal tract (and liver) are common and need to be considered in patients who have common complaints and
disorders such as anorexia, nausea, vomiting, oral ulcers,
abdominal pain, diarrhea, pancreatitis, or liver function test
abnormalities.
• Successful antiretroviral drug therapy has diminished
greatly the incidence of opportunistic infections in
patients infected with HIV.
• Multiple infections often occur simultaneously in
immunosuppressed HIV-infected patients.
• Adverse effects of antiretroviral drug therapy involving
the gastrointestinal tract are common.

Oral Cavity

Oral lesions occur in up to 80% of HIV-infected patients and
may be the ﬁrst symptom in up to 10% of patients (Table 10.1).

Esophagus

Case—A 27-year-old man who has HIV infection presents
with new dysphagia to solids. He is an injection drug user and
has been noncompliant with antiretroviral drug therapy.
Thrush is found on physical examination. The CD4 count is
110/μL (0.110×109/L), and his plasma HIV viral load is more
than 30,000 copies/mL.

The clinical presentation of this patient strongly suggests
an opportunistic infection of the esophagus with Candida,
and initial treatment should focus on the HIV infection and
empiric administration of ﬂuconazole.
Common symptoms of esophageal disorders include dysphagia, odynophagia, and chest pain unrelated to swallowing.
With successful antiretroviral treatment of HIV infection,
common disorders such as gastroesophageal reﬂux disease
and pill esophagitis are more likely to occur than infectious
esophagitis. Of the opportunistic infections involving the
esophagus, Candida is the most common fungal infection and
cytomegalovirus (CMV) is the most common viral infection;
herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection is less common.
Candida infection often causes dysphagia, whereas CMV and
HSV infections and idiopathic esophageal ulceration often
cause odynophagia. Two-thirds of patients with Candida
esophagitis have oral thrush, hence the role of empiric therapy; however, nearly 25% have a second cause of their symptoms (multiple coexistent pathogens). CMV infection and
idiopathic esophageal ulceration are unusual if the CD4 count
is more than 100/μL (0.1×109/L).
Empiric treatment with ﬂuconazole is recommended for
patients with mild to moderate symptoms (dysphagia or
odynophagia) who have thrush. About 75% have a response in
3 to 5 days to a 200-mg loading dose on the ﬁrst day, followed
by 100 mg/day for 14 to 21 days. Endoscopy is indicated for

patients who do not have a prompt response to treatment or
who are severely symptomatic. Barium studies are not useful.
At endoscopy, brush cytology is more sensitive than biopsy to
diagnose Candida esophagitis, although the typical appearance (multiple plaquelike, often linear or conﬂuent creamywhite lesions, with bleeding points when removed) is very
speciﬁc. Candida often (up to 50% of cases) is an oral commensal and usually (up to 90% of cases) is found in stool specimens. Also, Candida esophagitis can be asymptomatic.
Treatment may be topical for mild cases. Ketoconazole and
itraconazole absorption are dependent on acid in the stomach.
Some patients with Candida esophagitis may not have a
response to ﬂuconazole. Voriconazole, posaconazole, anidulafungin, caspofungin, or micafungin also may be effective.
Amphotericin compounds are used less often now than previously. Only rare cases with frequent, severe recurrences merit
ﬂuconazole (100-200 mg/day) for secondary prophylaxis.
Primary prevention is not recommended.
CMV infection often produces large, but sometimes small,
shallow or deep, focal or serpiginous, usually painful
(odynophagia or chest pain) ulcers in the middle to distal
third of the esophagus. Erosions, strictures, ﬁstulas, perforations, or mass lesions are less frequent. Up to 15% of persons
with CMV esophagitis have concomitant retinitis; thus, a
complete ophthalmologic examination should be performed.
The diagnosis of CMV esophagitis requires endoscopy, with

10 Gastrointestinal Manifestations of Human Immunodeﬁciency Virus Infection

biopsy specimens taken from the base of the ulcer (CMV
involves the vessels and endothelium, whereas HSV affects
epithelial cells at the edge of ulcers) to examine for cytopathic
effects (intranuclear inclusions, perinuclear halo, and cytoplasmic inclusions). Serologic studies (most patients are
already positive) and culture studies (contamination with
blood) are less speciﬁc. Immunohistochemistry and in situ
hybridization can improve sensitivity. Treatment with ganciclovir, valganciclovir, foscarnet, or cidofovir, as well as
HAART, usually helps.
HSV esophagitis often presents with multiple small, superﬁcial ulcers (“volcano” ulcers) or erosive esophagitis (Fig. 10.1).
Strictures and ﬁstulas are rare. Vesicles rarely are visualized.
Biopsy specimens from the edge of ulcerations should show
cytopathic changes (ground-glass nuclei, eosinophilic Cowdry
type A intranuclear inclusions, and multinucleate cells). Treatment with acyclovir or foscarnet usually is successful. Primary
prophylaxis is not recommended. Some patients with frequent, severe recurrences require secondary prophylaxis.
Idiopathic esophageal ulcers may be single or multiple, and
they often occur in the distal esophagus. By deﬁnition, all
diagnostic studies (biopsy, brush, cultures, and special studies) are negative. Pain is the norm, and ﬁstulas may occur.
Treatment includes corticosteroids or thalidomide.
Other unusual causes of esophageal lesions include infections with papillomavirus, Epstein-Barr virus, papovavirus,
Histoplasma, Aspergillus, Mucorales, Cryptococcus, Actinomyces,
Nocardia, Leishmania, Cryptosporidium, Pneumocystis, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare,
as well as bacillary angiomatosis, lymphomatoid granulomatosis, non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, and Kaposi’s sarcoma.

• Candida and CMV are the most common opportunistic
infections of the esophagus.
• Cytopathic changes diagnostic of CMV or HSV ulceration involving the esophagus are found most often in
biopsy specimens from the base or edge of the ulceration, respectively.
Stomach

Gastric disorders related to immunosuppression of persons
infected with HIV are uncommon. Epigastric discomfort may
be due to CMV infection involving the stomach or, more
likely, gastroesophageal reﬂux disease, distal esophageal ulceration (due to CMV infection, idiopathic esophageal ulceration, or HSV infection), peptic ulcer disease, or dyspepsia.
Gastric lymphoma can present with anorexia, nausea, vomiting, pain, or bleeding, whereas Kaposi’s sarcoma involving the
stomach is more likely to be asymptomatic. Whether “AIDS
gastropathy” (achlorhydria or hypochlorhydria with gastric
atrophy and antiparietal cell antibodies) exists is unclear. Rare
infections of the stomach include cryptosporidiosis, histoplasmosis, bacillary angiomatosis, herpes zoster, and infection
with M avium-intracellulare. Also, idiopathic aphthous ulcers
have been identiﬁed in the stomach.

Small Bowel

Case—A 35-year-old woman with HIV infection treated successfully with antiretroviral drugs presents with voluminous
watery diarrhea after a trip to Haiti. She complains of nausea,

Section IV Miscellaneous Disorders

cramps, and a recent 5-lb weight loss, but she states that she
does not have fever or gastrointestinal tract bleeding. Fecal
leukocytes and occult blood are not observed on stool examination. Standard stool cultures for bacteria are negative. Mild
eosinophilia is apparent on a peripheral blood smear.
The clinical presentation of this patient is consistent with
Isospora belli infection of the small bowel, which is endemic in
Haiti. This should respond promptly to antibiotic treatment
with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Because antiretroviral
drug therapy has been successful in this patient, recurrent
infection is not likely.
The principal presentation of small-bowel disease in HIVinfected patients is enteritis, with diarrhea that is often highvolume, watery, and fecal-leukocyte–negative and sometimes
with nausea, vomiting, bloating, periumbilical cramps, weight
loss, or malabsorption. Diarrhea of colonic origin is more
likely to be small-volume, with frequent, urgent, loose stools,
lower abdominal pain, and often fecal-leukocyte–positive,
with or without blood. Opportunistic infections are more
likely to occur in persons with CD4 lymphocyte counts less
than 100 to 200/μL (0.1-0.2×109/L). Commonly, medications
used to treat HIV infection are implicated as a cause of diarrhea. In diarrhea thought to be due to infection, a pathogen is
identiﬁed in only 50% to 85% of cases and more than one
pathogen may be discovered in up to 25% of cases.
The initial diagnostic approach to chronic diarrhea in HIVinfected patients should include the following: 1) freshly collected stools for bacterial culture (including Salmonella,
Campylobacter, and Shigella), ova and parasites, fecal leukocytes, and Clostridium difﬁcile toxin; 2) special studies (monoclonal antibodies, modiﬁed acid-fast and trichrome stains) for
Giardia, Cryptosporidium, Cyclospora, and Microsporida;
and 3) blood cultures for enteric pathogens and M aviumintracellulare (especially if the patient is febrile). If the results
of these studies are negative, especially in sicker and more
immunosuppressed patients, endoscopic evaluation is indicated. Persons who are less ill and have a CD4 lymphocyte
count greater than 200/μL (>0.2×109/L) and no pronounced
weight loss usually do not have an opportunistic infection and
can be given an empiric trial of antidiarrheal medications.
Endoscopy with small-bowel (preferably distal duodenum or
proximal jejunum) biopsy and aspiration for parasites can be
performed when a small-bowel source for the diarrhea is suspected. Colonoscopy with ileoscopy and ileal biopsy can be
helpful in the detection of selected small-bowel infections
(Cryptosporidium).

small-bowel epithelial cells (apical, small [2-8 μm], extracytoplasmic but intracellular sporozoites), with various degrees of
villous atrophy, but it also can involve the esophagus, stomach, colon, biliary tree, or lung. Diagnosis can be made by
examining the stool for oocysts (modiﬁed acid-fast stain or
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) or performing biopsy
of the small bowel (biopsy of the terminal ileum may be more
helpful diagnostically than that of the proximal small bowel).
Rectal biopsy ﬁndings also may be diagnostic. Severe highvolume diarrhea with wasting (malabsorption, lactose intolerance, or vitamin B12 deﬁciency) is most common when CD4
counts are less than 50/μL (<0.05×109/L). Speciﬁc therapy
with medications such as paromomycin, nitazoxanide, and
azithromycin can be helpful, but antiretroviral therapy has the
best chance of improving the diarrhea.
Microsporida—Two species of this former parasite now
reclassiﬁed as a fungus, Enterocytozoon bieneusi and Encephalitozoon (Septata) intestinalis, can be transmitted as a zoonosis
or by the fecal-oral route. Ingestion of watermelon can be a
risk factor. Enterocytozoon bieneusi involves small-bowel epithelium (small-bowel biopsy, intracellular, 1–2-mm meronts
and spores [Fig. 10.2]) or the hepatobiliary tree. Encephalitozoon intestinalis involves intestinal and often extraintestinal
sites (kidney or lung). Currently, the diagnosis usually can be
made with stool examination (modiﬁed trichrome stain,
chemoﬂuorescent agents, or monoclonal antibody testing) or
with small-bowel biopsy (villous atrophy may be seen) or
aspiration. The clinical presentation of immunosuppressed
HIV-infected patients is similar to that of patients infected
with Cryptosporidium. No effective antibiotic therapy is available for Enterocytozoon bieneusi infection. HAART is more
likely to be helpful. The less common Encephalitozoon intestinalis infection can be treated with albendazole. Encephalitozoon intestinalis may be identiﬁed in the lamina propria of the
small intestine and in urine sediment.

Small-Bowel Infections

Small-bowel infections often include the following:
Cryptosporidium—This parasite is ubiquitous and transmitted as a zoonosis (humans, cats, dogs, calves, lambs, and
other animals, especially newborn pets), by fecal-oral transmission, and, worldwide, through food (raw oysters and
unpasteurized juices) and water (including recreational) contamination by as few as 10 to 100 oocysts. It usually infects

10 Gastrointestinal Manifestations of Human Immunodeﬁciency Virus Infection

Isospora—I belli is another protozoan that is transmitted
among humans by fecal-oral routes and contaminated water.
It is endemic in developing countries (Haiti and Africa).
Multiple large intracellular forms (schizonts, merozoites, and
gametocytes), mild villous atrophy, and inﬁltrating eosinophils can be identiﬁed in small-bowel biopsy specimens, and
stool examination (modiﬁed acid-fast stain) may show large
oocysts and Charcot-Leyden crystals. Eosinophilia can be
observed in peripheral blood smears. Infection with this parasite is treated with sulfonamides such as trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole or with ciproﬂoxacin. However, recurrences
are common in immunosuppressed patients and may require
repeat courses of therapy or secondary prophylaxis.
Cyclospora—This parasite is larger than Cryptosporidium
but smaller than Isospora. The species that infects humans,
Cyclospora cayetanensis, is transmitted through fecal-oral
routes and contaminated water, herbs (Thai basil), and fruit.
Diagnosis can be made with stool examination (acid-fast
stains) or small-bowel biopsy (various degrees of villous atrophy are seen in biopsy specimens). As for Isospora infection,
trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or ciproﬂoxacin therapy is
effective, but relapse may be frequent and require re-treatment
or secondary prophylaxis.
Giardia and Entamoeba—Giardia lamblia and Entamoeba
histolytica infections are not more common, severe, or prolonged in HIV-infected patients than in non–HIV-infected
patients; however, infections are more common in those who
practice oral-anal sex. Entamoeba histolytica has been found
more often in HIV-infected persons in Taiwan than in HIVinfected persons elsewhere. Stool examination (for cysts and
trophozoites), duodenal aspirates, and stool antigen tests are
used to make the diagnosis. Treatment is with metronidazole.
Cytomegalovirus—Infection with CMV can occur throughout the gastrointestinal tract but is most common in the
esophagus and colon.
Mycobacterium—M avium-intracellulare can involve the
small bowel. Patchy areas of edema, erythema, friability,
erosions, nodularity, a frosted appearance, or yellowish nodules or plaques may be found at endoscopy. Patients with this
infection usually have low CD4 lymphocyte counts (<100/μL
[<0.1×109/L]) and often have fever, weight loss, diarrhea,
abdominal pain, anemia, and malabsorption. Small-bowel
biopsy specimens typically show macrophages stuffed with
many acid-fast organisms. Blood cultures also may be diagnostic, but stool cultures do not accurately predict tissueinvasive disease. Differentiation from M tuberculosis requires
culture results. When present, M tuberculosis usually affects
the ileocecal region. Patients with mycobacterial infections
may have extensive and bulky mesenteric or retroperitoneal
adenopathy, with areas of central necrosis seen on computed
tomography (Fig. 10.3). Multidrug therapeutic regimens
improve symptoms, and HAART ultimately can clear this systemic infection.
Uncommon Infections—Other, more uncommon infections that may involve the small intestine include leishmaniasis, toxoplasmosis, Pneumocystis carinii (now, P jiroveci)

infection, histoplasmosis, candidiasis, coccidioidomycosis,
aspergillosis, cryptococcosis, mucormycosis, and strongyloidiasis. Intestinal involvement with Kaposi’s sarcoma, often
related to human herpesvirus 8 (purplish red submucosal
lesions, frequently difﬁcult to diagnose with endoscopic
biopsy), is usually asymptomatic, but some of the lesions can
hemorrhage. Recent reports suggest that saliva is an infectious
source. Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma often involves the small
intestine and frequently is associated with fever, weight loss,
abdominal pain, mass lesions, bleeding, and diarrhea. Most of
these cases of lymphoma are of B-cell origin.
• Small-bowel disease often can be distinguished from
large-bowel disease on the basis of clinical presentation.
• Medications used to treat HIV infection commonly
cause gastrointestinal symptoms.
• Patients who are less ill, have CD4 counts greater than
200/mL, and do not have pronounced weight loss usually do not have opportunistic infections and can be
given an empiric trial of antidiarrheal medications.
Colon

Case—A 32-year-old man who recently was found to be
infected with HIV comes to the emergency department with
new fever, abdominal pain, and bloody diarrhea. He recently
bought his daughter a puppy at the local mall. The puppy has
had nonbloody diarrhea.
The clinical presentation of this patient is consistent with
colitis due to Campylobacter infection acquired from the
infected young dog and emphasizes the importance of preventing exposure in HIV-infected persons.
Diarrhea due to colon disease is extremely common in
HIV-infected patients. Immunosuppressed patients are more

132

Section IV Miscellaneous Disorders

likely to have enteric infections from Salmonella, Shigella, or
Campylobacter. These infections, some of which also can
involve the small bowel, tend to be more common, more persistent, more often resistant to antibiotics, and more likely to
recur. In general, antibiotics such as ciproﬂoxacin are indicated for all HIV-positive immunosuppressed patients with
Salmonella or Shigella infections, and in all but the most mild
and self-limited Campylobacter infections. Blood cultures and
stool examination for fecal leukocytes often are positive, especially for Salmonella enteritidis and S typhimurium. Another
bacterial infection more common in HIV-infected patients is
enteroaggregative Escherichia coli. Yersinia, Aeromonas, and
other E coli are not more common in these patients. Exposure
to the following should be avoided: raw shellﬁsh (Vibrio vulniﬁcus); reptiles (Salmonella); young or sick pets (Salmonella,
Campylobacter, and Cryptosporidium); raw or undercooked
eggs, meat, and shellﬁsh (Salmonella, Listeria, noncholera
vibrios, E coli O157:H7); unpasteurized dairy products, poorly
washed produce, soft cheeses, ready-to-eat cold cuts or hot
dogs (Listeria and Salmonella); raw seed sprouts, refrigerated
meat spreads, and deli foods that cannot be reheated; and
unpasteurized apple cider (E coli O157:H7). Streptococcus
bovis sepsis and endocarditis may be associated with gastrointestinal tract abnormalities such as colon cancer. Empiric
treatment with ciproﬂoxacin may be useful for presumed bacterial infections before the agent is identiﬁed. Thus, HIVinfected patients should avoid the following: human and
animal feces, contaminated water (drinking and recreational),
newborn and very young pets, calves, lambs, reptiles, stray
pets, contaminated soil, raw meat, raw ﬁsh, raw shellﬁsh,
travel to parts of the world with probable exposure to unsafe
food or water, unpasteurized juices, raw seed sprouts, questionable cold cuts, unclean produce, soft cheeses (eg, Brie,
Camembert, feta, and blue-veined and Mexican-style cheese
such as queso fresco), refrigerated pâtes, refrigerated meat
spreads, poorly cooked eggs, poorly cooked and reheated leftovers, many deli foods, and food from street vendors.
CMV infection often affects the colon, with diarrhea,
abdominal pain, bleeding, ulceration (Fig. 10.4), mass lesion,
perforation, ﬁstula, and weight loss as clinical manifestations.
The CD4 lymphocyte counts usually are low (<50-100/μL
[<0.05–0.1×109/L]). Infection may be asymptomatic. Diagnosis
requires tissue biopsy specimens showing cytopathic changes;
biopsy specimens from even normal-appearing areas can be
diagnostic and should be taken. Use of immunohistochemistry increases the diagnostic yield. Also, CMV DNA testing of
blood, tissue, and body ﬂuids may be helpful. Up to 18% of
cases may involve the right colon alone, and the infection
would not be diagnosed with ﬂexible sigmoidoscopy. Antiviral
therapy with agents such as ganciclovir, foscarnet, or cidofovir
usually is indicated, as well as HAART.
Clostridium difﬁcile colitis is common, but it is not more
severe, persistent, or recurrent in immunosuppressed than in
nonimmunosuppressed persons. Other less common infections
are due to M avium-intracellulare, M tuberculosis, Bartonella
henselae (bacillary angiomatosis), Cryptosporidium, Entamoeba

histolytica (symptomatic colitis is rare), Cryptococcus,
Toxoplasma, Pneumocystis, Leishmania, Penicillium marneffei
(Southeast Asia), and Candida. Histoplasmosis and schistosomiasis are also less common than C difﬁcile infections.
Several organisms found in stool samples are of uncertain
clinical signiﬁcance, including non-histolytica Entamoeba,
Balantidium coli, spirochetes, Blastocystis hominis, adenovirus,
Rotavirus, Astrovirus, Coronavirus, Picobirnavirus, and
Calicivirus.

(due to infections, neoplasms, or lymphoid hyperplasia).

10 Gastrointestinal Manifestations of Human Immunodeﬁciency Virus Infection

Anorectal disease is more common in HIV-infected men who
have sex with men than in other HIV-infected patients. These
patients are at increased risk for herpes simplex infection
(chronic cutaneous perianal ulcers, pain, tenesmus, mucopurulent discharge, inguinal lymphadenopathy, dysuria, and
saddle paresthesias), CMV infection, gonorrhea, syphilis, idiopathic ulcer, condylomata (human papillomavirus), molluscum contagiosum, anal squamous cell carcinoma (especially
with HIV and human papillomavirus coinfection), Chlamydia
as well as Actinomyces infection, Kaposi’s sarcoma, lymphoma,
and Leishmania infection.
• Many infections in immunocompromised HIV-infected
patients can be prevented.
• Enteric infections may be diagnosed with blood culture
and stool studies.
• Noninfectious causes of diarrhea have become more
common in HIV-infected patients receiving antiretroviral medications.

Pancreas

Pancreatic involvement in immunosuppressed HIV-infected
patients often results from medications and infections (pancreatitis) and less often from malignancy. Hyperamylasemia,
pancreatic in origin or due to renal failure or macroamylasemia,
may occur in asymptomatic persons. Medications often implicated in pancreatitis include dideoxycytidine, dideoxyinosine,

133

pentamidine, dapsone, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.
Infections reported to involve the pancreas are protean and
include CMV, herpes simplex virus, Toxoplasma, Pneumocystis,
Candida, Cryptococcus, histoplasmosis, aspergillosis, M aviumintracellulare, and M tuberculosis. Kaposi’s sarcoma and lymphoma also may affect the pancreas.

Nonvariceal Gastrointestinal Tract Bleedinga
Jeffrey A. Alexander, MD

Upper Gastrointestinal Tract Bleedinga

Upper gastrointestinal (UGI) tract bleeding (“UGI bleeding”)
constitutes 75% to 80% of all cases of acute gastrointestinal
tract bleeding. The incidence has decreased, but the mortality
rate from acute UGI bleeding, ranging from 3% to 10%, has
not changed appreciably in the past 50 years. This lack of
change in mortality rate likely is related to the increased age of
patients who present with UGI bleeding and the increase in
associated comorbid conditions. Peptic ulcers are the most
common source of UGI bleeding, accounting for about 40%
of cases. Other major causes are gastric erosions (15%–25% of
cases), bleeding varices (5%–30%), and Mallory-Weiss tears
(5%–15%). The use of aspirin or nonsteroidal antiinﬂammatory drugs (NSAIDs) is prevalent in 45% to 60% of all cases of
acute bleeding. Moreover, the risk of UGI bleeding is increased
in patients who take as few as one “baby aspirin” (81 mg)
per day.
Initial Approach to Patients With Upper
Gastrointestinal Tract Bleeding

The initial evaluation of a patient with UGI bleeding should
focus on assessment of 1) hemodynamic status and 2) comorbid conditions.
Melena can result when as little as 100 mL of blood is
instilled into the UGI tract, and instillation of 1,000 mL or
more initially leads to hematochezia. Hematochezia from UGI

Abbreviations: H2, histamine2; NSAID, nonsteroidal antiinﬂammatory drug; UGI, upper gastrointestinal

bleeding is a sign of severe bleeding and, if associated with a
red nasogastric aspirate, has a mortality rate near 30%. Patients
bleed whole blood; therefore, the hematocrit may not decrease
immediately with acute bleeding. Extravascular ﬂuid will enter
the vascular space and restore volume for up to 72 hours,
thereby leading to a subsequent decrease in the hematocrit.
Similarly, the hematocrit may continue to decrease for a few
days after bleeding has stopped, and a decrease in hematocrit
without clinical evidence of blood loss is not diagnostic of
recurrent bleeding. Adequate intravenous access should be
provided. Volume and blood resuscitation as well as stabilization of any other comorbid active medical conditions should
be achieved before endoscopy. Rarely, massive bleeding cannot
be stabilized adequately before endoscopy. Intubation for
airway protection should be considered in patients with ongoing hematemesis or those with suspected active bleeding and
decreased consciousness or loss of the gag reﬂex. There is no
evidence that nasogastric lavage helps stop bleeding, although
it may be helpful in cleansing the stomach before endoscopy.
Prognostic Factors
Clinical Factors

Age older than 70 years is a risk factor for mortality. Comorbid
conditions that increase mortality include pulmonary disease
(acute respiratory failure, pneumonia, and symptomatic
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), malignancy, liver
disorders (cirrhosis and alcoholic hepatitis), neurologic disorders (delirium and recent stroke), sepsis, postoperative state,
cardiac disease (congestive heart failure, ischemic heart disease, and dysrhythmia), and renal disorders (acute renal failure, creatinine >4 mg/dL, and dialysis). Signs of large-volume
bleeding include fresh hematemesis or bright red nasogastric
aspirate and shock, the two most predictive risk factors for
mortality. Tachycardia (heart rate >100 beats/minute), orthostasis, and hypotension (systolic blood pressure <100 mm Hg)
135

136

Section IV Miscellaneous Disorders

are predictive of rebleeding. Coffee-ground emesis has no
prognostic value. A transfusion requirement of 4 units of blood
or more per resuscitative event is predictive of rebleeding and
mortality. Laboratory ﬁndings of note include thrombocytopenia, leukocytosis, and abnormal coagulation measures, all
of which increase mortality. Corticosteroid use increases mortality, and anticoagulant use increases the risk of rebleeding.
Endoscopic Factors

Only the ﬁndings of varices or gastric cancer have been shown
to be predictors of mortality. Active arterial spurting has been
associated inconsistently with increased mortality. Endoscopic
ﬁndings, however, have clear prognostic value in accessing
rebleeding rates. For reliable prognostication of rebleeding,
endoscopy should be performed within 24 hours after presentation. Nearly 94% of episodes of rebleeding occur by 72 hours
and 98% within 96 hours. The three endoscopic observations
that are independent predictors of rebleeding regardless of the
type of lesion are arterial spurting (rebleeding in 70%–90% of
cases), visible vessel or pigmented protuberance (40%–50%),
and adherent clot resistant to washing (10%–35%). Also,
ulcers larger than 2 cm and posterior duodenal bulb ulcers are
predictive of rebleeding.
Speciﬁc Lesions
Peptic Ulcers

The approach to a patient who has bled from peptic ulcer disease is determined at the time of endoscopy. There are many
options for endoscopic therapy. Thermal-coaptive coagulation involves the placement of the coagulating probe directly
on the bleeding vessel. With the heater probe (typical setting
in cases of peptic ulcer disease, 30 J) or BICAP probe (14–16 W),
thermal-coaptive coagulation is uniformly effective for coagulating vessels up to 2 mm in diameter. Injection therapy results
in short-term tamponade and vasospasm and can be induced
with the use of epinephrine (1:10,000). Vasodestruction is
long-term and can be induced by sclerosants or alcohol (total
injection volume not to exceed 2 mL). Endoscopic clipping
has not been shown to be any more effective than thermal
therapy. However, it may be preferred for use in patients with
coagulation disorders or in cases in which further coaptive
coagulation may not be desirable.
Endoscopic therapy is indicated for patients with active
arterial bleeding and those with a nonbleeding visible vessel
(pigmented protuberance). An adherent clot is a predictor of
rebleeding and can be managed with endoscopic therapy or
high-dose proton pump inhibitor therapy (or both). All three
endoscopic treatment options have been shown to induce initial hemostasis in more than 90% of cases. However, epinephrine injection, followed by a more permanent form of treatment
(coagulation, vasodestruction, or clipping), has been shown to
be more effective than epinephrine therapy alone. Patients with
a clean ulcer base (rebleeding rates <5%) and a ﬂat pigmented

spot (rebleeding rates 5%–10%) do not require endoscopic
therapy and likely could be discharged soon after endoscopy.
Deep ulcers may tend to expose larger vessels that may not be
amenable to endoscopic coagulation. Risk factors for failure of
endoscopic therapy include hemodynamic instability, active
bleeding, ulcers larger than 2 cm, large exposed vessels, and
ulcer location on the lesser curvature (left gastric artery) of the
stomach or posterior duodenal bulb (gastroduodenal artery).
Ulcers with nonbleeding visible vessels more than 2 mm in
diameter should not be treated endoscopically. Rebleeding
after endoscopic therapy occurs 5% to 30% of the time.
Re-treatment for recurrent bleeding achieves long-term hemostasis in more than 70% of cases. Second look endoscopy after
bleeding cessation is not recommended.
If endoscopic therapy fails, angiographic embolization of
the bleeding vessel is an option in patients with a poor operative risk and is associated with lower mortality than surgery.
No data support the use of histamine2 (H2) blockers or antacids in controlling peptic ulcer bleeding. Multiple studies have
suggested that high-dose proton pump inhibitor therapy is
beneﬁcial for patients with peptic ulcer bleeding and high-risk
stigmata, both with and without endoscopic therapy.
Presumably, the beneﬁt is related to clot stabilization occurring in a nonacid environment. In vitro studies suggest that
pH >6.0 is required for platelet aggregation and ﬁbrin formation, whereas pH <5.0 is associated with clot lysis. This level of
pH increase is achieved best with proton pump inhibitor therapy administered as a continuous intravenous infusion.
However, it is not clear that high-dose infusion proton pump
inhibitor therapy is more effective than treatment with a standard dose. Octreotide may be of some beneﬁt in torrential
bleeding as a temporizing measure because of its effects on
decreasing splanchnic blood ﬂow.
Patients with UGI bleeding and Helicobacter pylori infection should be given therapy directed against H pylori, and
eradication of the infection should be proven. Patients taking
NSAIDs should avoid them, if possible. Patients without a
reversible cause of peptic ulcer disease should receive longterm ulcer prophylaxis with either a full-dose H2 blocker (ranitidine 300 mg/day) or a proton pump inhibitor. Without
treatment, recurrent ulcer bleeding will occur in approximately one-third of these patients in 3 to 5 years’ time. This
rate can be decreased to less than 10% with full-dose H2
blocker or proton pump inhibitor prophylaxis. Ulcer rebleeding is uncommon in patients with proven eradication of H
pylori infection who avoid the use of NSAIDs. However, ulcer
prophylaxis may be reasonable for patients in whom H pylori
infection has been eradicated but who have a clinically important comorbid condition, especially if they take NSAIDs continuously or intermittently.
Mucosal Erosive Disease

Endoscopic esophagitis, gastritis, and duodenitis are deﬁned by
the endoscopic ﬁndings of hemorrhage, erythema, or erosions.
These lesions rarely are associated with major UGI bleeding.

11 Nonvariceal Gastrointestinal Tract Bleeding

Large hiatal hernias can be associated with chronic blood loss
related to Cameron lesions, which are linear erosions along the
crests of gastric folds at or near the diaphragmatic hiatus.
Gastric erosive disease usually is related to NSAID use, alcohol
intake, or stress gastritis. Bleeding generally is minor unless
ulceration develops. Prophylaxis of NSAID injury with misoprostol or proton pump inhibitors decreases the risk of ulcer
development, as does the substitution of cyclooxygenase-2
inhibitors for traditional NSAIDs. Stress gastritis leads to clinically signiﬁcant UGI bleeding in more than 3% of patients in
intensive care units. At higher risk are patients receiving
mechanical ventilation for more than 48 hours, patients with
coagulopathy, and patients with head injury or extensive burn
injuries. Prophylactic therapy with H2-receptor antagonists,
proton pump inhibitors, or sucralfate is indicated for these
high-risk patients. Although not universally agreed upon, it
appears that H2-receptor antagonists may be slightly more
effective than sucralfate. However, these agents may be associated with a greater incidence of pneumonia and, possibly, mortality. Proton pump inhibitors appear to be at least as equally
effective for stress ulcer prophylaxis.

137

Infection appears to have a major pathogenic role in the development of these ﬁstulae, which usually develop off the origin
of the graft, often with pseudoaneurysm formation. The classic “herald bleed,” in which bleeding stops spontaneously
hours to months before massive bleeding, occurs in about
one-half of patients. Evaluation should begin with extended
upper endoscopy to examine for evidence of distal duodenal
bleeding (positive in <40% of cases) and to exclude other
sources of bleeding. For a patient who has an aortic graft,
severe bleeding, and negative endoscopic ﬁndings, exploratory
surgery is indicated. Angiography rarely is helpful and may
delay appropriate treatment. Computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging may be helpful in demonstrating air
surrounding the graft in proximity to the duodenum or an
absence of a tissue plane between the graft and the duodenum,
which suggests the diagnosis. The correct diagnosis is established preoperatively in as few as one-third of patients.
Hematobilia and Hemosuccus Pancreaticus

Mallory-Weiss tears occur at the gastroesophageal junction
and often are present with a classic history of recurrent retching, frequently in an alcoholic patient, before the development
of hematemesis. Most tears occur on the gastric side of the
gastroesophageal junction, but 10% to 20% of them may
involve the esophagus. Bleeding stops spontaneously in 80%
to 90% of patients, and rebleeding occurs in 2% to 5%.
Endoscopic therapy with thermal coagulation or injection
therapy is of beneﬁt for active bleeding. Angiographic therapy
with intra-arterial vasopressin or embolization also can be
effective, as can oversewing the lesion intraoperatively.

Hematobilia is manifested classically as UGI bleeding accompanied by biliary colic and jaundice. The diagnosis is made
endoscopically by seeing blood coming from the ampulla. The
most common cause of hematobilia is trauma, including liver
biopsy, to the liver or biliary tree. Extrahepatic or intrahepatic
artery aneurysms often are caused by trauma and may communicate with the bile ducts. Rarely, bleeding can be caused
by gallstones, hepatic or bile duct tumors, and cholecystitis.
Hemosuccus pancreaticus usually represents bleeding from
peripancreatic blood vessels into the pancreatic duct. This
commonly is due to rupture of true aneurysms or pseudoaneurysms often associated with pancreatitis and pseudocysts.
Angiography is used to locate the bleeding site. Transcatheter
embolization is the treatment of choice. Surgery may be
required for embolization failures.

Portal Hypertensive Gastropathy

Neoplasms

This lesion is more frequent in the proximal than distal stomach and gives the gastric mucosa a mosaic or snakeskin appearance, with or without red spots. Severe portal hypertensive
gastropathy has diffuse red spots as well as the mosaic pattern
and can be associated with both chronic and acute gastrointestinal tract bleeding. Bleeding usually is not massive, and therapy is directed at lowering portal pressure. Rebleeding can be
decreased with nonselective β-blocker therapy.

Bleeding can occur from primary (adenocarcinoma, stromal
tumors, lymphomas, or neuroendocrine tumors) and, occasionally, metastatic UGI tumors (melanoma or breast).
Gastrointestinal stromal tumors often appear as a submucosal
mass with central ulceration and are not an infrequent cause
of severe UGI bleeding. Effective therapy generally is surgical.

Aortoenteric Fistula

Anomalies With Skin Lesions

Fistulas can occur between any major vascular structure and
the gastrointestinal tract. Aortoesophageal ﬁstulas are caused
by thoracic aortic aneurysms, esophageal foreign bodies, or
neoplasms. Up to 75% of aortoenteric ﬁstulas communicate
with the duodenum, usually in the third portion. These may
develop from an aortic aneurysm but are related more commonly to abdominal aortic (graft) reconstructive surgery.

Vascular lesions can be seen throughout the gastrointestinal
tract in several systemic diseases and syndromes such as OslerWeber-Rendu disease (or hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasias), the elastic tissue disorders of pseudoxanthoma elasticum
and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, CREST (calcinosis cutis,
Raynaud phenomenon, esophageal dysfunction, sclerodactyly,
and telangiectasias) syndrome, and blue rubber bleb nevus
syndrome. Endoscopic coagulation therapy is the treatment

Mallory-Weiss Tear

Vascular Anomalies

138

Section IV Miscellaneous Disorders

of choice. High-dose estrogen-progesterone therapy is of
debatable value but has been reported to decrease bleeding in
patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasias not amenable to complete endoscopic therapy.
Anomalies Without Skin Lesions

Vascular ectasias can occur anywhere in the UGI tract but are
more common in the duodenum and stomach, particularly in
older patients and those with chronic renal failure or previous
radiotherapy. These lesions are cherry red and often fernlike
in appearance. Histologically, dilated, ectatic, or tortuous submucosal blood vessels (or a combination of these) are seen;
the pathogenesis of these vessels is not known. These lesions
may be diffuse or localized. Vascular ectasias are treated with
endoscopic thermal coagulation. Estrogen-progesterone therapy has been shown to be effective occasionally and can be
attempted when endoscopic therapy fails.
Gastric antral vascular ectasia, or “watermelon stomach,”
is a speciﬁc type of localized ectasia often seen in elderly
women who present with iron deﬁciency anemia and evidence
of mild UGI tract blood loss. This lesion is associated with several other disease processes, most notably, connective tissue
disorders, atrophic gastritis, pernicious anemia, and portal
hypertension. Red streaks that traverse the gastric antrum and
converge at the pylorus, resembling the stripes on a watermelon, are seen with endoscopy. Histologically, large blood
vessels with intravascular ﬁbrin thrombi and ﬁbromuscular
hyperplasia are seen, but the diagnosis usually is made on the
basis of the classic endoscopic appearance. If iron replacement
is inadequate to maintain a normal level of hemoglobin, endoscopic thermal therapy often is helpful. Argon plasma coagulation is the preferred thermal treatment for gastric antral
vascular ectasia because of the large area usually requiring
treatment. Occasionally, antrectomy is necessary.
Dieulafoy’s lesion is an abnormally large submucosal artery
that can rupture and bleed. The bleeding is arterial and usually
moderate to severe. Most of these lesions are within 6 cm of
the gastroesophageal junction, but they can occur in the duodenum and jejunum as well as in the esophagus, colon, rectum,
and biliary tree. They can be difﬁcult to diagnose when the
bleeding has stopped, and endoscopy may need to be repeated
several times to identify the lesion. When the lesion is identiﬁed, endoscopic tattooing of the lesion often is helpful, especially if surgical therapy is planned. Dieulafoy’s lesion appears
as a small protruding vessel surrounded by normal mucosa or
as a minute mucosal defect. These lesions are amenable to conventional endoscopic therapy, band ligation, and endoscopic
clipping. Rebleeding rates after endoscopic therapy are low. A
nonbleeding visible vessel should be treated. Angiographic
embolization can be effective in high-risk patients.

ileum, and 3) lower—distal to the terminal ileum. Only 3% to
5% of episodes of gastrointestinal tract bleeding originate
from a mid bowel source.
Depending on the transit time, which in turn is determined
by the volume of bleeding, patients with non-UGI bleeding
may present with melena, hematochezia, or occult bleeding. It
is important to note that bacterial metabolism needs sufﬁcient
time for melena to be generated from fresh blood.
Hematochezia most commonly indicates bleeding from a
colonic source. However, the source is more proximal in 5%
to 10% of patients. It would be extremely uncommon for
hematochezia to originate from a source in the proximal
gastrointestinal tract without hemodynamic evidence of
bleeding or clinical evidence of rapid gastrointestinal transit
(eg, hyperperistalsis).
If blood is limited to the toilet paper or surface of formed
stool, a perianal source (eg, hemorrhoids or ﬁssures) is likely.
Tenesmus suggests a rectal origin (eg, proctitis). For all
patients, the possibility of neoplasia must at least be considered and often excluded.
Speciﬁc Lesions
Diverticular Bleeding

Patients with diverticular bleeding typically present with
acute blood loss, as manifested by maroon-colored stools or
hematochezia. Minor or occult bleeding is not characteristic
of diverticular bleeding or diverticulosis. Diverticular bleeding
and diverticulitis are distinct conditions that rarely occur
together. Diverticular bleeding is painless except for the
cramping that may occur with the cathartic effect of blood
within the colon.
Diverticular bleeding is thought to originate more commonly from the right colon, where ostia tend to be wider and
the colon wall thinner. It is estimated that 3% to 5% of patients
with diverticulosis will have diverticular bleeding. Bleeding
most commonly occurs during the sixth and seventh decades
of life and stops spontaneously in more than 75% of patients.
Generally, rebleeding occurs in 25% of patients. After a second
episode, the risk of rebleeding is approximately 50%.
For ongoing or recurrent bleeding, angiography often is
performed with the intention of identifying an actively bleeding vessel. If the vessel is identiﬁed, transcatheter embolization
can be attempted, although in some series colonic infarction
has been as high as 20%. Transcatheter vasopressin can control bleeding in 90% of cases, but rebleeding rates are high.
Endoscopic therapy has been reported to be safe and effective,
but locating the actual bleeding lesion may be difﬁcult.
Vascular Ectasia

Non-Upper Gastrointestinal Tract Bleeding

Gastrointestinal tract bleeding has been classiﬁed according to
the level of the tract: 1) upper—proximal to the ampulla of
Vater, 2) mid—from the ampulla of Vater to the terminal

Vascular ectasias are typically smaller than 5 mm and are
found in 3% to 6% of patients undergoing colonoscopy. Most
commonly, they are in the right colon but may occur anywhere
in the gastrointestinal tract. These lesions are usually angiodysplasias, which are often multiple and believed to be related to

11 Nonvariceal Gastrointestinal Tract Bleeding

139

the aging process. Less than 10% of patients with angiodysplasia eventually have bleeding. Not uncommonly, these lesions
are uncovered by bleeding diathesis, such as anticoagulation
or platelet dysfunction. The lesions may lead to acute overt as
well as occult gastrointestinal tract bleeding.
For many patients, iron repletion therapy alone is sufﬁcient. Endoscopic therapy is effective but associated with a
high rebleeding rate. Angiographic embolization can be used
to control acute bleeding. Estrogen and progesterone when
taken together may be of beneﬁt for some patients, particularly those with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, but the
data are conﬂicting.

Stercoral ulcers are associated with constipation and occur
most commonly in the rectosigmoid area or, occasionally, in
the more proximal colon. They often become manifest after
disimpaction. Solitary rectal ulcer syndrome often is associated with excessive straining. The ulcer usually occurs on the
anterior wall, 6 to 10 cm above the anal verge. Both of these
lesions may come to attention because of bleeding.
Patients with radiation proctitis may present months to
years after receiving radiation to the prostate or pelvic organs.
Sigmoidoscopy shows characteristic mucosal telangiectasias.
The bleeding is rarely severe, and endoscopic argon plasma
coagulation therapy is the treatment of choice.

Neoplasm

Infection

Patients with neoplasm of the colon or small intestine may
present with either acute or occult non-UGI bleeding. Tumors
of the small intestine may be a relatively common cause of
obscure non-UGI bleeding in patients younger than 50 years
and are malignant two-thirds of the time. Carcinoids, adenocarcinomas, and gastrointestinal stromal tumors account for
most of these lesions.

Infections may be associated with non-UGI bleeding. Obvious
clues include a travel history or evidence of systemic toxicity
such as fevers, rashes, arthralgias, eosinophilia, or diarrhea. In
patients infected with human immunodeﬁciency virus,
common causes for non-UGI bleeding are cytomegalovirus
colitis and lymphoma.
NSAID Enteropathy and Colopathy

Ischemic Colitis

Patients with ischemic colitis often present with pain and lowvolume hematochezia. This may be seen in patients who have
had abdominal vascular surgery, in those who have vasculitis,
cardiac disease, or clotting disorders, or in those who receive
estrogen therapy. However, in most cases, no etiologic factor
is identiﬁed. Large-vessel disease is rarely found, and angiography generally is not indicated. There is no speciﬁc therapy,
and recovery is usually complete in several days. Occasionally,
however, a colonic stricture may develop.
Meckel’s Diverticulum

Meckel’s diverticulum, a remnant of the vitelline duct, usually
occurs 100 cm proximal to the ileocecal valve. Autopsy series
suggest a prevalence rate of 0.3% to 3%. Approximately 50%
of these diverticula contain gastric mucosa, and patients, typically a child or young adult, may present with bleeding.
Inﬂammatory Bowel Disease

Patients with inﬂammatory bowel disease may present with
gross, bloody diarrhea, which is the classic presentation for
ulcerative colitis. Major hemorrhage is uncommon but can
occur.
Benign Rectoanal Disease

Patients with benign rectoanal disease often present with
hematochezia. Painless hematochezia with blood on the toilet
paper or the surface of formed stool is most suggestive of
hemorrhoidal bleeding. Painful outlet bleeding is typical of a
rectal ﬁssure.

Increasingly, NSAID enteropathy and colopathy are being recognized as explanations for non-UGI bleeding. Autopsy studies have documented small intestinal ulcers in 8% of patients
who had taken NSAIDs within the preceding 6 months.
Diaphragmatic strictures are strongly suggestive of NSAIDinduced inﬂammation. NSAIDs also are known to reactivate
inﬂammatory bowel disease.
Approach

The evaluation and management of patients who present with
non-UGI bleeding are determined largely by the clinical presentation and the differential diagnosis that has been generated. Essential points to keep in mind when answering
questions are the following:
• Patients who are being evaluated because of positive
ﬁndings on fecal occult blood testing require colonoscopy. Without signs or symptoms of UGI tract disease
or iron deﬁciency, the value of esophagogastroduodenoscopy is debatable.
• Generally, the yield of a small-bowel follow-through
study in patients with obscure gastrointestinal tract
bleeding is less than 5%. This yield increases to 5% to
10% with enteroclysis.
• Technetium 99m-tagged red blood cell radionuclide
scans can detect bleeding rates as low as 0.1 mL/minute.
The patient may be scanned repeatedly over a 12- to
24-hour period in an attempt to capture intermittent
bleeding. Radionuclide scans generally are not useful in
identifying a speciﬁc site of bleeding. They are more sensitive for bleeding and are less invasive than angiography and often are used to determine the best timing for
angiography.

140

Section IV Miscellaneous Disorders

• Mesenteric angiography is more accurate than radionuclide scans but requires a faster bleeding rate (>0.5 mL/
minute). Angiographic yields are much greater with
active gastrointestinal tract bleeding (60%–70%) than
when angiography is performed after bleeding has ceased
(<20%). Angiographic therapy with transcatheter infusion of vasopressin or embolization has been effective
but does carry a signiﬁcant risk of bowel infarction.
• Capsule endoscopy clearly is the best method for evaluating the entire small bowel in patients with obscure
bleeding. It shows an abnormal ﬁnding in about 70% of
cases and a clinically signiﬁcant ﬁnding in about 50% of
cases. The diagnostic yield is better if the procedure is
performed within a few days after a bleeding event and
after an oral bowel preparation. The technology for
localization and blood detection is improving, but capsule retention that requires surgery is still an issue.
• Multiphasic computed tomographic enterography
appears promising, particularly in the evaluation of
small-bowel tumors.
• Push enteroscopy has been reported to identify probable
bleeding sites in 50% of patients with obscure gastrointestinal tract bleeding. This can be performed with an
adult or pediatric colonoscope, but the depth of insertion is greater with a dedicated enteroscope (length 200–
250 cm) used with an overtube. Of note, about 25% of
the diagnoses made with push enteroscopy involve areas
within the reach of a standard endoscope.
• Balloon-assisted endoscopy can be performed peroral or
per rectum (or both), with a diagnostic yield of about
60%. With bidirectional balloon-assisted endoscopy,
complete enteroscopy can be accomplished in about 50%
of cases. Endoscopic therapy can be administered. Most
authorities think that the depth of small bowel reached is
greater with double-balloon than with single-balloon
scopes. Capsule endoscopy can direct the balloon-assisted
endoscopy approach; lesions seen with capsule endoscopy
in the ﬁrst two-thirds of small-bowel transit time generally are identiﬁed with oral balloon-assisted endoscopy.
• Intraoperative enteroscopy has been reported to detect
abnormalities in about 70% of patients. However, recurrent bleeding is not uncommon, and only about 40% to

Vascular Disorders of the Gastrointestinal Tract
Stephen C. Hauser, MD

Mesenteric ischemia can occur from any of the myriad of conditions that decrease intestinal blood ﬂow. Cappell divided
these conditions into 1) secondary mesenteric ischemia due to
extrinsic vascular compression or trauma (Table 12.1) and 12.2)
primary mesenteric ischemia (mesenteric ischemic vasculopathy) resulting from arterial emboli, arterial or venous thrombi,
low-ﬂow states, or vasculitis. The esophagus receives its principal blood supply segmentally from small vessels from the
aorta, right intercostal artery, bronchial arteries, inferior thyroid artery, left gastric artery, short gastric artery, and left
phrenic artery. Vascular disease of the esophagus is extremely
rare, except after surgical resection and in rare cases of
vasculitis (Behçet’s syndrome). The stomach, duodenum,
and rectum have numerous arterial inputs with rich collateralization. Vascular disorders that affect the stomach, duodenum, or rectum are also extremely rare, except for the reasons
mentioned above for the esophagus.a
The principal arterial supply to the gut distal to the esophagus is from the celiac, superior mesenteric, and inferior mesenteric arteries. Embolic disease most frequently affects the
superior mesenteric artery because of its large diameter and
narrow angle of takeoff from the abdominal aorta. Collaterals
may include the meandering mesenteric artery or arc of Riolan
at the base of the mesentery (connects the superior mesenteric
and inferior mesenteric arteries), the marginal artery of
Drummond along the mesenteric border (connects the superior mesenteric and inferior mesenteric arteries), the pancreaticoduodenal arcade (connects the celiac and superior
mesenteric arteries), the arc of Barkow (connects the celiac
and superior mesenteric arteries), and the arc of Buhler
(connects the celiac and superior mesenteric arteries). They
enlarge rapidly in response to localized mesenteric ischemia.

The inferior mesenteric vein joins the splenic vein, which in
turn joins the superior mesenteric vein to form the portal vein.

Patient History and Examination

Primary mesenteric ischemia is responsible for about 1 per
1,000 hospital admissions, with cases distributed equally
between the small and large bowel. Risks include age (older
than 50 years) and conditions that predispose to stasis, thrombosis, inﬂammation, or embolism of the mesenteric vasculature (Table 12.2). Symptoms may be acute (sudden, hours),
subacute (days), chronic (intermittent, over weeks to months),
or a combination (usually acute and chronic). Patients with
acute mesenteric ischemia involving the small bowel often
present with abdominal pain that is severe, persistent (lasting
hours), and poorly localized. The pain typically is out of proportion to the ﬁndings on abdominal palpation (ie, pain is
much greater than tenderness). Prompt evaluation is critical.
Without early diagnosis and therapy, the mortality rate can be
as high as 70%. Other nonspeciﬁc complaints can include
fever, nausea, vomiting, abdominal distention, and diarrhea.

Radiation

Physical ﬁndings can include abdominal distention, diminished or increased bowel sounds, and nonspeciﬁc diffuse
abdominal tenderness. Localized abdominal tenderness,
rebound, rigidity, altered mental status, and visible gastrointestinal tract bleeding usually are late manifestations of more
severe ischemic damage to the small bowel. Occult gastrointestinal tract bleeding can be an early ﬁnding. Leukocytosis
with left shift, hemoconcentration, and an increase in amylase, aspartate aminotransferase, lactate, creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, or phosphate levels may or may not occur.
These tests lack both sensitivity and speciﬁcity, but when
results are abnormal, they suggest more advanced (necrotic)
bowel ischemia. Attention to predisposing conditions, their
extraintestinal manifestations (congestive heart failure,
hypotension, sepsis, arrhythmias, or splanchnic vasoconstrictors such as digoxin and cocaine), and their initial management are critical in resuscitation of the patient (volume
replacement, enhancing cardiac output, diminishing splanchnic vasoconstriction, and administration of broad-spectrum
antibiotics). Patients with primary mesenteric ischemia of the
colon (ischemic colitis) usually present with acute abdominal
pain (commonly left lower quadrant), often with urgency,
diarrhea, and passage of bright red blood per rectum. Overall,
colonic ischemia has a much better outcome than does smallbowel ischemia.

Initial Diagnostic Evaluation

In an acutely ill patient, plain abdominal radiographs are
important to rule out secondary causes of mesenteric ischemia

and other causes of acute abdominal pain, principally obstruction and perforation. “Thumbprinting” due to submucosal
edema may be seen, as well as an ileus pattern. Pneumatosis
intestinalis or portal venous gas is a late ﬁnding that suggests
transmural necrosis of the intestine (gangrene). Contrastenhanced abdominal-pelvic computed tomography (CT) may
help exclude other causes of acute intra-abdominal pain and
has been recommended to diagnose acute (or acute-onchronic) mesenteric venous thrombosis in patients with a history of deep venous thrombosis or thrombophlebitis or a
family history of a hypercoagulable state. CT ﬁndings may be
normal in acute mesenteric ischemia involving the small bowel
or may show nonspeciﬁc changes such as bowel wall thickening, submucosal hemorrhage, mesenteric stranding, portal
venous gas, and pneumatosis. Multidetector CT angiography
(MDCTA) has been shown to have a greater sensitivity and
speciﬁcity (each up to 95%) than standard CT (each approximately 65%). Magnetic resonance angiography is less sensitive
for more peripheral emboli and is often less readily available.
CT should not defer resuscitation or arteriography in very ill
patients with suspected acute mesenteric ischemia of the small
bowel. Patients with subacute or chronic pain syndromes beneﬁt from a more complete evaluation, including CT and
duplex ultrasonography (see below).
Acutely ill patients with suspected small-bowel ischemia
require prompt diagnosis and treatment, for which selective
mesenteric arteriography is the standard. If angiography is not
readily available or transmural intestinal necrosis (gangrene)
is suspected, laparotomy is indicated. Resuscitation and
administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics constitute initial therapy for all patients.

Superior Mesenteric Artery Embolus

Superior mesenteric artery emboli are common, accounting
for 5% of cases of peripheral emboli and 50% of cases of primary mesenteric ischemia of the small bowel. The emboli are
usually from the heart; an aortic origin (atheromatous cholesterol embolism) is less common. Emboli usually obstruct
distal to the origin of the superior mesenteric artery.
Arrhythmias, cardioversion, cardiac catheterization, myocardial infarction or dyskinesia, congestive heart failure, valvular
heart disease, previous embolism, and age older than 50 years
are major risk factors. Peritonitis requires laparotomy, with or
without resection and with or without embolectomy. Otherwise, embolectomy (usually surgical) is indicated. Patients
with acute onset of a partial or small occlusion of a distal
branch of the superior mesenteric artery may be candidates
for thrombolytic therapy, intra-arterial papaverine, or anticoagulation (Fig. 12.1). Generalized vasoconstriction of the
superior mesenteric artery occurs from occlusion of a single
branch of the artery and often persists after embolectomy.
Hence, many experts recommend intra-arterial papaverine
before and for 24 hours after embolectomy or until a secondlook operation (if indicated) is performed. Prophylaxis against

burns, multiple organ failure, congestive heart failure, or hemorrhage), vasospasm (digoxin, α-adrenergic agonists, amphetamines, or cocaine), and preexisting atherosclerotic disease
(hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, or vasculopathy). Angiography can be diagnostic (lack of thrombus or
embolus, alternating spasm and dilatation [“string-of-sausages”
sign], pruning, and spasm of mesenteric arcades) (Fig. 12.2).
Treatment involves optimization of cardiac output, avoidance
of vasospastic medications, and prolonged (up to several days)
selective intra-arterial infusion of vasodilators such as papaverine, tolazoline, nitroglycerin, or glucagon. Laparotomy with or
without resection and warm saline lavage may be needed in
selected cases. Anticoagulation generally is not prescribed.
Broad-spectrum antibiotics should be administered.

permission.)

further embolization (anticoagulation) usually is indicated
preoperatively then restarted 24 to 48 hours postoperatively.

Superior Mesenteric Artery Thrombus

Superior mesenteric artery thrombus accounts for about 15%
of cases of primary mesenteric small-bowel ischemia. Risk factors for superior mesenteric artery thrombus include old age,
low-ﬂow states (arrhythmia, hypotension, sepsis, dialysis,
vasoconstrictive drugs, myocardial infarction, dyskinesia, and
congestive heart failure), atherosclerosis (acute-on-chronic
ischemia, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia,
smoking history, and vasculopathy), hypercoagulable states,
vasculitis, ﬁbromuscular dysplasia, trauma, and aortic or mesenteric artery aneurysm. Up to one-third of patients have a
history of chronic mesenteric ischemia (see below). Therapy
usually involves intra-arterial papaverine and surgical thrombectomy or surgical bypass grafting, bowel resection, or some
combination of these.

Nonocclusive Mesenteric Ischemia

Nonocclusive mesenteric ischemia accounts for 20% of cases
of acute primary mesenteric ischemia of the small bowel. Risks
for low-ﬂow state include decreased cardiac output (myocardial
infarction or dyskinesia, arrhythmia, shock, sepsis, pancreatitis,

Mesenteric venous thrombosis, usually superior mesenteric
vein thrombosis (up to 95% of cases), accounts for about 5%
to 10% of cases of acute mesenteric ischemia. Risk factors
include a personal or family history of hypercoagulopathy and
a history of deep venous thrombosis. Causes include hypercoagulable states, hyperviscosity syndromes, intra-abdominal
infections (pyelophlebitis, diverticulitis, and appendicitis) or
inﬂammation (Crohn’s disease and pancreatitis), malignant
obstruction, portal hypertension, vasculitis, and trauma
(Table 12.3). Symptoms may be acute (hours) or subacutechronic (days to months) and include abdominal pain (severe,
out of proportion to physical ﬁndings, or less severe and
vague), anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation,
abdominal distention, and gastrointestinal tract bleeding.
Patients may present with bacteremia (especially Bacteroides).
Because the differential diagnosis is broad and includes
obstruction, perforation, and other causes of acute abdominal
pain and acute mesenteric ischemia, the initial evaluation usually involves plain abdominal radiography and contrastenhanced CT; the latter generally is diagnostic of mesenteric
venous thrombosis with or without portal vein or splenic vein
thrombosis (Fig. 12.3). Although angiography is less reliable
for the diagnosis of mesenteric venous thrombosis, it allows
intra-arterial infusion of vasodilators. Therapy involves laparotomy (with or without bowel resection when infarction is
suspected), ﬂuid resuscitation, broad-spectrum antibiotics,
avoidance of vasoconstrictors, a nasogastric tube (if there is
distention), and anticoagulation (in the absence of bleeding).
Selected patients with acute onset of mesenteric venous
thrombosis may be candidates for thrombolytic therapy,
followed by anticoagulation. Underlying conditions such
as hypercoagulable states, hyperviscosity syndromes, intraabdominal infections, and malignancy require concomitant
diagnosis and treatment.
Mesenteric venous thrombosis may have the presentation
of a subacute or chronic illness, with vague abdominal pain
and distention or no symptoms. It may be an incidental CT
ﬁnding (multiple collateral vessels) in patients with portal

hypertension, chronic pancreatitis, or malignancy. Long-term
anticoagulation should be considered except for higher-risk
patients such as the elderly or those with portal hypertension
and prominent varices or portal hypertensive gastropathy.
Splenic vein thrombosis is usually due to pancreatitis,
malignancy such as pancreatic cancer, or trauma. Many of the
patients develop isolated gastric varices and splenomegaly. For
symptomatic patients (gastric variceal bleeding or hypersplenism), splenectomy is the best treatment.

Chronic Mesenteric Ischemia

Risk factors for chronic mesenteric ischemia include older age,
atherosclerosis, vasculitis, and aortic aneurysm. A history of
previous vascular disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus,
renal insufﬁciency, and smoking is common.
Patients with classic chronic mesenteric ischemia present
with episodic ischemic, upper or midabdominal pain that typically occurs 15 to 30 minutes postprandially, lasts 1 to 3 hours,

and becomes worse with time. Thus, patients lose weight
because of fear of eating (sitophobia). Nausea, vomiting, bloating, diarrhea, and constipation also can occur. Some patients
may have malabsorption, otherwise unexplained gastroduodenal ulcerations, and small-bowel biopsy ﬁndings of nonspeciﬁc surface cell ﬂattening, chronic inﬂammation, and
villous atrophy. More than one-half of patients have a bruit
detected on abdominal examination.
Arteriography of these patients usually shows atherosclerotic stenosis of the origin of at least two of the three major
visceral arteries. However, this is a common angiographic
ﬁnding in otherwise healthy age-matched controls. Doppler
ultrasonography—if able to visualize the celiac and superior
mesenteric arteries (each about 80% of cases)—may show
increased ﬂow velocities, consistent with marked stenosis.
MDCTA and magnetic resonance imaging also may be useful
in the identiﬁcation of proximal large-vessel arterial lesions.
However, considering the diagnosis, excluding other causes
of abdominal pain and other symptoms (ie, pancreatic
cancer, gastric cancer, gastroparesis, small-intestinal bacterial

overgrowth syndromes, partial small-bowel obstruction, biliary disease, gastric volvulus, or paraesophageal hernias), and
obtaining arteriographic results consistent with the clinical
ﬁndings are crucial. Surgical reconstruction and, in selected
cases, angioplasty with or without stents can be therapeutic.

145

Ischemic Colitis

Ischemic colitis represents nearly one-half of all cases of mesenteric ischemia and accounts for nearly 1 in 2,000 hospital
admissions. Most cases are acute, self-limited, occur in persons older than 60 years, and without any apparent cause.
Transient nonocclusive hypoperfusion involving a segment of
the colon may be the cause, and subtle hypercoagulable states
may be contributory. Atherosclerotic or thrombotic occlusion
of the inferior mesenteric artery or its branches and nonocclusive low-ﬂow states are not uncommon causes of ischemic colitis (with associated vasospasm). Less common causes
include embolus, vasculitis, hypercoagulable states, iatrogenic
ligation of the inferior mesenteric artery (aortic surgery), and
colonic obstruction (colon cancer, diverticulitis, or strictures).
Other unusual associations include long-distance running
(usually affecting the cecum), intra-abdominal infections or
inﬂammatory disease, pit viper bite, scuba diving, and use of
birth control pills, danazol, alosetron, digitalis, vasopressin,
gold, pseudoephedrine, psychotropic drugs, ergot, amphetamines, cocaine, or sumatriptan. Some gastrointestinal infections, (cytomegalovirus, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Klebsiella
oxytoca, and Clostridium difﬁcile) and chronic inﬂammatory
bowel disease can mimic ischemic colitis clinically and histologically. Ischemic colitis due to low-ﬂow states often affects
watershed areas such as the splenic ﬂexure and descending
colon and rectosigmoid junction as well as the right colon.
Often, but not always, the rectum is spared in ischemic colitis.
The clinical symptoms of ischemic colitis vary but often
include acute abdominal pain (in two-thirds of patients, usually the left lower quadrant), urgency, diarrhea, distention,
anorexia, nausea, vomiting, or bright red blood or maroon
material per rectum (variable amounts), or some combination
of these. Physical ﬁndings often include one or more of the
following: abdominal tenderness over the affected bowel, distention, fever, and tachycardia. Laboratory ﬁndings range
from normal in patients with less severe ischemic colitis to
those found in persons with severe ischemic necrosis (see
above). Plain radiographs of the abdomen may show evidence
of submucosal edema and hemorrhage (“thumbprinting”) or
the ﬁndings may be nonspeciﬁc. Colonoscopy often provides
endoscopic and histologic ﬁndings consistent with ischemic
colitis (segmental, patchy ulceration, edema, erythema, and
submucosal hemorrhagic or purple nodules) and helps exclude
other causes of abdominal pain and gastrointestinal tract
bleeding. CT may help exclude other disorders, especially in
more symptomatic, sicker patients. Gastrointestinal infections
(acute bacterial colitis, C difﬁcile infection, and parasitic infections), inﬂammatory bowel disease, diverticulitis, pancreatitis,
and other causes of acute abdominal pain (pelvic disorders in
women) need to be excluded. Typically, angiography is not
required, but it may be for patients with more severe ischemic
colitis and it should be for patients with right-sided involvement (which can imply involvement of the distal small bowel).
Patients with right-sided ischemic colitis have more pain, less
bleeding, and a worse outcome.

146

Section IV Miscellaneous Disorders

As for all types of mesenteric ischemia, treatment depends
on the cause and includes supportive treatment (volume
replacement, correction of low-ﬂow states, broad-spectrum
antibiotics, transfusions, and avoidance of vasoconstrictive
medications) and, in selected cases, surgery (signs and symptoms of transmural necrosis, perforation, massive bleeding,
recurrent sepsis, failure to improve over time, or stricture formation). In most patients, ischemic colitis resolves promptly
with supportive therapy alone. Patients younger than 60 years
or those with recurrent episodes should be evaluated for
thrombophilic states. Studies also lend support to the usefulness of thrombophilic screening in older patients with idiopathic ischemic colitis.

Miscellaneous Syndromes
Celiac Artery Compression

Celiac artery compression, also called median arcuate ligament
syndrome, is a rare syndrome with abdominal pain, which is
caused most likely by extrinsic compression of the celiac axis
(neural structures and the wall of the celiac artery) by the arcuate ligament. Rarely, the superior mesenteric artery also may
be involved. Ischemia to the gut is unlikely to cause the pain
(because only one vessel is involved and collateral vessels are
well developed). Celiac artery compression usually occurs in
young women, often with upper abdominal pain, especially
after eating (increased blood ﬂow through the celiac artery),
often with weight loss, and with a loud systolic bruit detected in
the epigastric area on physical examination. Lateral aortography should demonstrate a typical concave defect over the superior aspect of the celiac artery near its takeoff from the aorta,
with respiratory variability. Collaterals may be seen. Surgical
release of the compression of the celiac artery or reconstruction
of the artery (or both) may be curative. Preoperatively, other
possible causes of the symptoms must be excluded.
Vasculitis and Visceral Aneurysms

Many vasculitic syndromes can involve the gastrointestinal
tract. Buerger’s disease can cause multiple distal occlusions of
medium- and small-sized arteries of the mesenteric circulation. Polyarteritis nodosa typically involves medium- and
small-sized arteries, resulting in segmental microaneurysms,
and affects the small bowel more often than the colon. Many
patients have fever, abdominal pain, an increased erythrocyte
sedimentation rate, hypertension, and multiple organ involvement. Some have gastrointestinal tract bleeding or perforation.
Nearly one-half of the patients are infected with hepatitis B
virus. Also, the gallbladder, liver, pancreas, and spleen may be
involved. The gastrointestinal tract often is involved in ChurgStrauss syndrome (small- and medium-sized arteries) and
Henoch-Schönlein purpura (sometimes with E coli O157:H7
or Campylobacter jejuni infection). With Henoch-Schönlein

purpura, IgA is deposited in multiple organs, including the
walls of blood vessels. Abdominal pain, gastrointestinal tract
bleeding, arthritis, and palpable purpura often are present.
Patients with severe rheumatoid arthritis, high titers of rheumatoid factor, nodules, cryoglobulinemia, low serum levels of
complement, and extra-articular manifestations also may have
vascular lesions involving the gut, pancreas, gallbladder, spleen,
and appendix, as may patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (especially those with antiphospholipid or cardiolipin
antibodies). Vasculitis with bowel involvement is less common
in patients with giant cell arteritis, Takayasu’s arteritis, hypersensitivity vasculitis, cryoglobulinemia, Behçet’s syndrome, or
Wegener’s granulomatosis. Mesenteric venous involvement
can occur with Churg-Strauss syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus, Behçet’s syndrome, lymphocytic phlebitis, and
idiopathic mesenteric phlebosclerosis.
Bowel as well as large-vessel rupture can be a life-threatening
complication of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type IV, with thin
fragile skin, easy bruisability, hyperextensible distal interphalangeal joints, and splanchnic artery aneurysms due to a
defect in type III collagen. Similar vascular catastrophes with
gastrointestinal tract bleeding can occur in patients with pseudoxanthoma elasticum type I, which often is accompanied by
peau d’orange skin and choroiditis. Occasionally, mesenteric
vasculitis is found in patients with carcinoid syndrome.
Splanchnic artery aneurysms include splenic artery aneurysms
(due to atherosclerosis, ﬁbrodysplasia of the media, portal
hypertension, pregnancy, pancreatitis, vasculitis, infection, or
trauma), hepatic artery aneurysms (often due to trauma,
including liver biopsy), mesenteric aneurysms (often due to
atherosclerosis), and aneurysms of the arterial supply to the
pancreas (often due to pancreatitis and pseudocysts)—all
of which may present with gastrointestinal tract or intraperitoneal hemorrhage. Hemobilia may occur with hepatic
artery aneurysms. Symptomatic aneurysms, sizable aneurysms
(≥1 cm for a hepatic artery aneurysm and ≥2 cm for a splenic
artery aneurysm) and splenic artery aneurysms discovered
during pregnancy should be treated, usually by interventional
radiology.

Gastrointestinal Manifestations of
Systemic Disease
Stephen C. Hauser, MD

Many systemic disorders can have gastrointestinal manifestations. This chapter is an overview of these diseases as they
affect the gastrointestinal tract and liver, with emphasis on
disorders not considered elsewhere in this book.

nausea, vomiting, gas, abdominal pain, diarrhea, dysphagia,
gastroesophageal reﬂux disease, rumination, Mallory-Weiss
tear, gastric dilatation, gastroparesis, constipation, superior
mesenteric artery syndrome, cholelithiasis, pancreatitis,
increased values on liver function tests, and abnormal gastrointestinal tract motility.

Symptoms And Signsa
Nausea and Vomiting
Eating Disorders and Weight

Obesity, deﬁned as a body mass index greater than 30.0 kg/m2,
affects one-third of adults in the United States. It can have
adverse effects on the gastrointestinal tract, including an
increased risk of symptomatic gastroesophageal reﬂux disease
and Barrett’s esophagus; increased risk of esophageal, stomach, pancreas, gallbladder, and colorectal adenocarcinoma as
well as adenomatous polyps and hepatocellular carcinoma;
increased gallstone formation in women; fatty liver and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis; and complications in obese patients
with pancreatitis (gallstones and hypertriglyceridemia). Hypothyroidism, Cushing’s syndrome, hypothalamic disorders,
polycystic ovary syndrome, and drugs (especially antipsychotic
agents, tricyclic antidepressants, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, lithium, antidiabetic agents, and glucocorticoids) should
be considered in the differential diagnosis of obesity. Crash
diets with rapid weight loss can result in gallstones (increased
cholesterol saturation of bile and decreased gallbladder motility),
nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or severe constipation. Patients with
eating disorders (eg, bulimia or anorexia nervosa) may present
with a wide variety of gastrointestinal problems: hypogeusia,

Abbreviation: ALA, aminolevulinic acid

The differential diagnosis is protean and includes drugs (especially narcotics, dopamine agonists, digitalis, chemotherapy
agents, marijuana [cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome with
cyclic vomiting], and nonsteroidal antiinﬂammatory drugs),
toxins (alcohol, hypervitaminosis A, and poisoning), infections, vestibular diseases, central nervous system diseases,
pregnancy (see below), malignancy, psychiatric disorders,
metabolic disorders (eg, Reye’s syndrome, Jamaican vomiting
illness, uremia, parathyroid disease, diabetic ketoacidosis,
hyperthyroidism, sepsis, and Addison’s disease), myocardial
infarction (congestive heart failure), and radiation, as well as
intra-abdominal disorders. Vomiting must be distinguished
from rumination.
Diarrhea

Occasionally, diarrhea can be caused by systemic disorders
such as hyperthyroidism, Addison’s disease, hypoparathyroidism, collagen vascular diseases, vasculitis, malignancies
(eg, carcinoid, gastrinoma, pheochromocytoma, VIPoma,
medullary carcinoma of the thyroid, glucagonoma, mastocytosis, and other neuroendocrine tumors), immunologic disorders (see below), amyloidosis (see below), autonomic nervous
system disease, diabetes mellitus (see below), and, more commonly, drugs and toxins, including alcohol and radiation.

Section IV Miscellaneous Disorders

Constipation

The differential diagnosis should include drugs and toxins,
metabolic disorders (hypothyroidism, hypercalcemia, hypokalemia, hypopituitarism, diabetes mellitus, pheochromocytoma, and glucagonoma), neurologic disorders (central,
peripheral, or autonomic), myopathies, collagen vascular disease, amyloidosis, porphyria, and pregnancy.
Abdominal Pain

Extra-abdominal causes of acute or intermittent abdominal
pain include thoracic disorders (eg, myocardial infarction,
pulmonary embolus, pneumonia, and pericarditis), metabolic
disorders (diabetic ketoacidosis, diabetic radiculopathy, pheochromocytoma, Addison’s disease, uremia, hyperlipidemia,
porphyria, angioedema [see below], and hyperparathyroidism), hematologic disorders (sickle cell crisis, hemolysis, and
acute leukemia), neurologic diseases (herpes zoster, tabes dorsalis, abdominal epilepsy, and abdominal migraine), drugs,
toxins, narcotic withdrawal, aneurysm, and heat stroke.
Jaundice and Abnormal Results of Liver
Function Tests

Unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia in the newborn can be
caused by hypothyroidism. In adults, congestive heart failure
is one of the most common causes of mild abnormal results of
liver function tests, including mild unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, mild increases in alanine aminotransferase and
aspartate aminotransferase levels, and, less often, a mild
increase in the alkaline phosphatase level. Liver function test
abnormalities are common in persons with systemic infections, including those due to diverse bacteria, fungi, and other
organisms. Mild to moderate increases in the serum levels
of aminotransferases, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin
may occur. These abnormal ﬁndings on liver function tests
improve with treatment of the infection. However, cholestasis
may take up to months to resolve. Many connective tissue diseases (see below) can be associated with abnormal liver function test results. Like many infections and sepsis, Hodgkin’s
disease without involvement of the liver or biliary tree can be
associated with increased alkaline phosphatase levels and even
jaundice.

Systemic Disorders

lesions. Lesions may involve all histologic layers (mucosa to
serosa) of the bowel wall. A hepatic artery–portal vein ﬁstula
can produce portal hypertension, biliary strictures, hepatobiliary infection, and cardiac failure. A hepatic artery–hepatic
vein ﬁstula may be complicated by cardiac failure, and a portal
vein–hepatic vein ﬁstula can result in hepatic encephalopathy.
Blue rubber bleb nevus syndrome, sometimes autosomal
dominant, consists of intestinal and cutaneous cavernous
hemangiomas with a bluish, rubbery consistency. Other internal organs also may be involved. Intestinal lesions can result in
intussusception. Similar hemangiomas may occur in the sporadic disorder Klippel-Trénaunay-Weber syndrome, involving the gut and skin, with hemihypertrophy of a limb and
varicose veins. Malignant atrophic papulosis (Degos’ disease)
consists of painless skin papules with cigarette paper-like white
centers and a telangiectatic periphery, with gastrointestinal
tract and central nervous system involvement. All these disorders can cause bleeding and require therapeutic endoscopic
or surgical intervention.
Several bullous skin disorders can manifest with involvement of the gastrointestinal tract, including epidermolysis
bullosa (trauma-induced blisters and involvement of the oral
cavity, esophagus, and anal area, with bullae, webs, strictures,
dysphagia, bleeding, and constipation), pemphigus vulgaris
(oral involvement, less commonly the esophagus and occasionally the lower gastrointestinal tract, with bleeding), and
bullous pemphigoid (oral, less often esophageal or anal,
involvement). Dilatation (trauma) of strictures in epidermolysis bullosa may lead to more stricturing; soft diets and corticosteroids may be helpful. Topical or systemic corticosteroids
may be useful in treating bullous pemphigoid and pemphigus
vulgaris.
Lichen planus can affect the mouth and esophagus (ulcers,
strictures, pain, dysphagia; also, it has an association with hepatitis C virus infection and primary biliary cirrhosis), psoriasis
can affect the skin and esophagus (webs and dysphagia), and
tylosis (autosomal dominant) can affect the skin (palmoplantar keratoderma) and esophagus (squamous cell carcinoma;
family screening and surveillance endoscopy are indicated).
Erythema nodosum is associated with Crohn’s disease,
ulcerative colitis, and infectious colitis (eg, Yersinia enterocolitica), as well as Behçet’s syndrome, sarcoidosis, malignancy,
infections, and drugs. Pyoderma gangrenosum also is associated with ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease, as well as with
malignancy (myeloproliferative disorders), autoimmune
chronic liver disease, and rheumatoid arthritis. Sweet syndrome may occur in patients with inﬂammatory bowel disease, infections, or hematologic malignancies.

Dermatologic
Immunologic

Many dermatologic disorders can be associated with gastrointestinal tract vascular bleeding lesions. Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia is an autosomal dominant disorder.
Telangiectasias can involve any part of the bowel and the lips,
tongue, mouth, extremities, chest, nose, liver, central nervous
system, retina, and lung. Endoscopically, these mucosal
telangiectasias are indistinguishable from angiodysplastic

A host of immunologic disorders have gastrointestinal manifestations. X-linked (Burton’s) hypogammaglobulinemia, a
maturational hereditary defect in B cells, results in gastrointestinal tract infections (Campylobacter, Giardia, and rotavirus),
small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, and perirectal abscesses.
Typically, plasma cells are not seen in rectal biopsy specimens.

13 Gastrointestinal Manifestations of Systemic Disease

151

Selective IgA deﬁciency occurs in about 1 in 500 persons; it is
usually sporadic but is sometimes familial. It is associated with
a lack of secretory immunoglobulin A1 and A2. Most persons
are well, and gastrointestinal tract infections (Giardia) are not
common. The prevalence of immunoglobulin A deﬁciency
(1:50) is increased among persons with celiac disease. Other
gastrointestinal associations include pernicious anemia, bacterial overgrowth with vitamin B12 deﬁciency, Crohn’s disease,
and nodular lymphoid hyperplasia. Common variable (lateonset or acquired) hypogammaglobulinemia, often sporadic,
also involves abnormal maturation of B cells, gastrointestinal
tract infections (Giardia and other parasites, small intestinal
bacterial overgrowth, rotavirus, and bacterial diarrhea), malabsorption, pancreatic insufﬁciency, sprue-like disorders, pernicious anemia, gastric cancer, nodular lymphoid hyperplasia,
cholelithiasis, autoimmune chronic hepatitis, sclerosing cholangitis, and biliary parasitosis (cryptosporidiosis). Also, carcinoma or lymphoma of the small and large bowel may occur.
Chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis is a heterogeneous
group of disorders (including polyglandular autoimmune
syndrome type I) with defective T-cell function, oropharyngeal or esophageal candidiasis, skin and nail lesions, and
various autoimmune (pernicious anemia) and endocrine
(hypoadrenal, hypothyroid, hypoparathyroid, and diabetes
mellitus) deﬁciencies. Hereditary angioedema is an autosomal
dominant (chromosome 11q11-13) disorder with a quantitative or qualitative deﬁciency of C1 esterase inhibitor resulting
in attacks of nonpitting, painless, nonpruritic angioedema
that can involve the skin, mouth, larynx, or gastrointestinal
tract. Gastrointestinal tract involvement includes attacks of
pain, sometimes with diarrhea, vomiting, intussusception, or
transient ascites. Imaging may show edematous bowel. Similar
presentations may be due to acquired C1 esterase inhibitor
deﬁciency (collagen vascular diseases and lymphoproliferative
disorders). Diagnostic testing includes C1 esterase inhibitor
levels (low in 85% of patients), C1 esterase function (low in
the 15% with normal or increased inhibitor levels), and C4
levels (absent during attacks and decreased between attacks).
C1 levels are normal. Danazol can prevent attacks, and C1
esterase inhibitor concentrate or fresh frozen plasma can be
administered during attacks. Angiotensin-converting enzyme
inhibitors also can cause angioedema of the intestine, independently of diminished complement or C1 esterase inhibitor
levels. Angiotensin II receptor antagonists also have been
implicated. An estrogen-dependent inherited (usually autosomal dominant) form of angioedema, also independently of
diminished complement or C1 esterase inhibitor levels, has
been reported during pregnancy or with the administration of
exogenous estrogens.

diarrhea, malabsorption, protein-losing enteropathy, and
low-ﬂow mesenteric ischemia). It is now thought that valvular
aortic stenosis might be associated with gastrointestinal angiodysplasia, perhaps on the basis of abnormal von Willebrand
multimers. Cardiac transplantation may be complicated by an
increased risk of bowel perforation, ulcers, cytomegalovirus
infection, pancreatitis, and gallstone-related disease. Any process that markedly decreases arterial blood ﬂow to the liver or
hepatic arterial oxygen content can result in hepatic ischemia.
Obstructive sleep apnea is an underrecognized cause of hepatic
ischemia. Persons with portal hypertension, congestive heart
failure, or biliary obstruction are at greater risk for episodes of
hepatic ischemia.

Cardiovascular

Renal

Congestive heart failure can present with liver involvement
(hepatomegaly, right upper quadrant pain, mild abnormal
results on liver function tests, and ascites with an increased
serum-to-ascites albumin gradient) and gastrointestinal tract
involvement (anorexia, nausea, bloating, abdominal pain,

Chronic renal failure can be complicated by dysgeusia,
anorexia, nausea, vomiting, esophagitis, gastritis, angiodysplasias of the gastrointestinal tract, peptic ulcer disease, duodenitis, duodenal pseudomelanosis (asymptomatic), abdominal
pain, constipation, pseudo-obstruction, perforated colonic

Pulmonary

Alpha1-antitrypsin deﬁciency can be thought of as either a pulmonary disease with liver manifestations or a liver disorder
with pulmonary consequences. Liver disease, including neonatal jaundice, chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, cholangiocarcinoma, and hepatocellular carcinoma, is due to the inability of
the liver to export an abnormal gene product (usually the ZZ
protease inhibitor type, with low serum alpha1-antitrypsin
levels), but liver disease does not occur in most of those with
an abnormal gene product or in any person with the null-null
phenotype (no gene product). More than 25% of patients with
cystic ﬁbrosis develop liver disease (steatosis, neonatal hepatitis, neonatal cholestasis, focal biliary cirrhosis, or gallstones),
which can be severe in up to 5% of them. Patients with chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease are at increased risk for peptic
ulcer disease. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and
asthma can facilitate gastroesophageal reﬂux. Sarcoidosis is a
systemic granulomatous disorder that commonly involves the
liver (often asymptomatic, with or without mild increases of
alanine aminotransferase, bilirubin, or alkaline phosphatase
levels; occasionally progressive hepatic ﬁbrosis resulting in cirrhosis; some patients have severe intrahepatic or extrahepatic
cholestasis with ductopenia; Budd-Chiari syndrome and
nodular regenerative hyperplasia also may occur). Less often,
sarcoidosis affects the gastrointestinal tract (esophageal
involvement with dysphagia, dysmotility, or stricture is rare
and generally due to hilar or mediastinal lymph node involvement; stomach involvement, with antral ulceration, pyloric
stenosis or gastric outlet obstruction, occurs more often; smallbowel disease, with malabsorption or protein-losing enteropathy is very rare, as is colonic involvement). Lung transplantation
may be complicated by postoperative colonic perforation and
vagal injury, with esophageal and gastric dysmotility, ulcers,
pancreatitis, cholelithiasis, and cytomegalovirus infection.

152

Section IV Miscellaneous Disorders

diverticula, small-bowel and colonic ulceration, intussusception, gastrointestinal tract bleeding, amyloidosis, diarrhea,
fecal impaction, and small intestinal bacterial overgrowth. In
patients undergoing hemodialysis, a refractory exudative
ascites of unclear pathogenesis can develop; this resolves with
renal transplantation. These patients also are more at risk for
ischemic colitis. Patients who have had renal transplantation
often develop infections and ulcerative complications of the
gastrointestinal tract, diverticulitis, and perforated colonic
diverticula. The adult form (autosomal dominant) of polycystic kidney disease is associated with hepatic cysts, choledochal
cysts, congenital hepatic ﬁbrosis, and Caroli’s disease. There
are rare reports of hyperammonemia and hepatic encephalopathy in patients without previous liver disease who have
severe urease-producing Proteus or Escherichia coli bacterial
infections.
Endocrine

Endocrine disorders commonly affect the gastrointestinal tract
and liver. Diabetes mellitus can be complicated by disorders of
the esophagus (dysmotility, gastroesophageal reﬂux disease,
and candidiasis), stomach (dysmotility, gastroparesis, bezoars,
and pernicious anemia), small bowel (dysmotility, bacterial
overgrowth, and celiac disease association), colon (dysmotility, constipation, fecal incontinence, and diarrhea), biliary tree
(cholelithiasis), pancreas (pancreatic insufﬁciency), and liver
(nonalcoholic fatty liver disease). Diabetic neuropathy and
ketoacidosis can present as abdominal pain, and diabetes mellitus is a risk factor for several forms of primary mesenteric
ischemia. Acromegaly is associated with an enlarged tongue,
an increased risk of colonic adenomas (which may be large,
multiple, and right-sided), colon cancer, hepatomegaly, and,
perhaps, stomach cancer. Gallstones are a risk in patients
receiving octreotide therapy. Patients with Addison’s disease
may present with anorexia, nausea, vomiting, weight loss,
malabsorption, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and mild liver function test abnormalities. Also, the disease may be associated
with atrophic gastritis and pernicious anemia. Serum levels of
aminotransferase levels may be increased. Hypercortisolism
may be associated with gastric ulceration, fatty liver, steatohepatitis, and increased aminotransferase levels.
Pheochromocytoma may occur with hypertension, abdominal pain, ischemic colitis, and diarrhea or ileus.
Hyperthyroidism may manifest as hyperphagia, weight loss,
mild diarrhea, steatorrhea, abdominal pain, vomiting, concomitant atrophic gastritis, dysphagia, ascites, jaundice, and
nonspeciﬁc mild liver function test abnormalities. Autoimmune chronic hepatitis and primary biliary cirrhosis also
may be associated disorders. Hypothyroidism often results in
anorexia, weight gain, constipation, dysphagia, heartburn,
and, less often, intestinal pseudo-obstruction, achlorhydria,
and ascites (high concentration of protein). Associated gastrointestinal diseases include pernicious anemia, ulcerative colitis, primary biliary cirrhosis, autoimmune chronic hepatitis,
and celiac disease. Hyperparathyroidism, with hypercalcemia,

classically produces anorexia, nausea, vomiting, constipation,
and abdominal pain; rarely, peptic ulcer disease and pancreatitis develop. Patients with hypoparathyroidism can
present with diarrhea, steatorrhea, abdominal pain, pseudoobstruction, protein-losing enteropathy, and lymphangiectasia; also, autoimmune chronic hepatitis may develop.
Hematologic

Sickle cell anemia often results in severe abdominal pain with
sickle cell crisis. The liver also may be affected (thrombotic
veno-occlusive crisis or hepatic infarction), with pain, fever,
and increased values on liver function tests. As in other hemolytic states, cholelithiasis (black pigment stones) is common.
Hemolytic uremic syndrome and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura can be complicated by gastrointestinal tract
bleeding, ulceration, perforation, toxic megacolon, cholecystitis, and pancreatitis, and, often, they are associated with gramnegative infections, such as those caused by E coli O157:H7,
Shigella, Salmonella, Yersinia, and Campylobacter. A host of
hypercoagulable states, some caused by hematologic malignancies, have been implicated in cases of Budd-Chiari syndrome, portal venous thrombosis, and primary mesenteric
(venous and arterial) ischemic states. Hypocoagulable states,
such as hemophilia, and platelet abnormalities often result in
gastrointestinal tract bleeding, obstruction, intramural hematomas, or intussusception.
Four of the porphyrias can occur with acute abdominal
crises (abdominal pain, vomiting, constipation, and hyponatremia are common). These four are acute intermittent
porphyria, variegate porphyria, hereditary coproporphyria,
and aminolevulinic acid (ALA) dehydratase deﬁciency. The
ﬁrst three are autosomal dominant. Acute intermittent porphyria is the most common acute porphyria. It is associated with
increased levels of ALA and porphobilinogen; there are no
skin ﬁndings. Variegate porphyria is characterized by increased
levels of urine coproporphyrin and stool protoporphyrin and
coproporphyrin; patients can have skin disease, with or without an abdominal attack. In hereditary coproporphyria, stool
and urine coproporphyrin levels are increased; skin disease
can be present, usually with an abdominal attack. In the very
rare ALA dehydratase deﬁciency, only the ALA level is increased;
there are no skin ﬁndings, and the condition is autosomal
recessive. Abdominal crises may be precipitated by fasting,
medications, alcohol, intercurrent illnesses, and menstruation. Urine ALA and porphobilinogen levels (ALA only with
ALA dehydratase) are always increased during an acute
abdominal crisis. In acute intermittent porphyria, urinary
ALA and porphobilinogen values usually are increased
between attacks.
Porphyria cutanea tarda affects only the skin and is associated with alcohol abuse or alcoholic liver disease, mild iron
overload or hemochromatosis, and hepatitis B or C virus
infection. Erythropoietic protoporphyria, with skin manifestations, can result in cirrhosis and liver failure due to hepatic
deposition of protoporphyrin.

13 Gastrointestinal Manifestations of Systemic Disease

Mastocytosis is a systemic inﬁltrative disorder of bone
marrow, skin, bone, spleen, central nervous system, gastrointestinal tract, and liver. Periodic ﬂushing (precipitated by
alcohol, stress, heat, or medications), hypotension, urticaria
pigmentosa, Darier’s sign (urticaria after scratching), chest
pain, dyspnea, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, and paresthesias may occur. Malabsorption, peptic ulcer disease (gastric acid hypersecretion), complicated gastroesophageal reﬂux
disease, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, increased serum alkaline phosphatase value, and, rarely, portal hypertension and
hepatic ﬁbrosis may occur.
Oncologic

Leukemias and lymphomas commonly involve the gastrointestinal tract and liver. Hodgkin’s disease can involve the liver,
extrahepatic bile ducts, or lymph nodes, or it can manifest as
intrahepatic cholestasis without hepatobiliary involvement.
Unusual tumors affecting the gut include alpha chain disease
(immunoproliferative small intestine disease), which diffusely
inﬁltrates the small intestine and adjacent lymph nodes
(B cells, α heavy chains produced in excess); mantle cell lymphomas, which mimic a multiple polyposis syndrome; multiple myeloma or amyloidosis, with focal plasmacytomas (mass,
ulceration, bleeding, or obstruction), gastrointestinal mucosal
inﬁltration with malabsorption, or hyperviscosity syndrome
(ischemia); Waldenström’s macroglobulinemia, with gastrointestinal tract and hepatosplenic inﬁltration and malabsorption; and small cell carcinoma of the lung and other
malignancies, with paraneoplastic pseudo-obstruction
(patients may be positive for anti-neuronal nuclear antibody,
type I Purkinje cell antibody, or N-type calcium channelbinding antibody).
Allogenic bone marrow transplantation often is complicated by graft-versus-host disease. Acute graft-versus-host
disease with erythematous maculopapular rashes, small and
large intestinal mucosal involvement (diarrhea, protein-losing
enteropathy, malabsorption, pain, bleeding, and apoptotic
bodies seen in biopsy specimens, even in endoscopically normal-appearing areas), and cholestatic liver disease usually
occurs in the ﬁrst 20 to 80 days after transplantation. Chronic
graft-versus-host disease (usually in persons with previous
acute graft-versus-host disease) with cholestatic liver disease
(vanishing bile ducts), esophageal disease (dysphagia, strictures, and webs), small-bowel disease (diarrhea or bacterial
overgrowth), skin disease, and polyserositis usually occurs
80 to 400 days after transplantation. Veno-occlusive disease of
the liver, with bland, nonthrombotic obliteration of small
hepatic veins and venules due to conditioning (radiation or
chemotherapy) therapy, usually occurs 8 to 23 days after
transplantation.
Neuromuscular

Many neurologic and muscular disorders affect the gastrointestinal tract. Acute head injury with intracranial hypertension,

153

like many other serious illnesses, can result in stress gastritis.
However, deep ulceration, sometimes with perforation, can
occur in this setting, apparently as a result of vagal stimulation
of gastrin and gastric acid production. Similar ulceration can
occur after burns that cover a large surface area of the body.
Abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting rarely are attributed to
migraine or temporal lobe epilepsy, the latter often including
central nervous system symptoms. Cyclic vomiting may present with recurrent attacks of abdominal pain, nausea, and
vomiting. Some persons with this disorder ﬁnd relief with hot
showers or baths and recover with cessation of the use of marijuana. Cerebrovascular disease and cerebral palsy commonly
result in oropharyngeal dysphagia due to dysmotility. Multiple
sclerosis frequently affects the gastrointestinal tract with
oropharyngeal dysphagia, gastroparesis, constipation, or disorders of defecation or fecal incontinence. Patients with
Parkinson’s disease often have oropharyngeal dysphagia, gastroesophageal reﬂux disease, esophageal dysphagia, constipation, and fecal incontinence. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and
myasthenia gravis both can cause oropharyngeal dysphagia.
More diffuse gastrointestinal tract dysmotility syndromes
occur with poliomyelitis, Huntington’s chorea, dysautonomia
syndromes, Shy-Drager syndrome, Chagas’ disease, and spinal
cord injuries. Patients with dementia may be at risk for aspiration because of oropharyngeal dysphagia, and they may have
weight loss because of decreased intake, poor diet, and pica.
Muscular dystrophies such as oculopharyngeal muscular
dystrophy (third nerve palsy, often French-Canadian ancestry) and Duchenne’s muscular dystrophy can be complicated
by oropharyngeal dysphagia. Duchenne’s muscular dystrophy
is associated with more widespread gastrointestinal tract
dysmotility.
Rheumatologic

Involvement of the gastrointestinal tract in scleroderma, a
common effect, is due to smooth muscle atrophy, ﬁbrosis,
small vessel vasculitis, and neural damage. Typically, the
esophagus is affected (decreased motility, weak lower esophageal sphincter, gastroesophageal reﬂux disease, Barrett’s
esophagus, adenocarcinoma, and pill esophagitis). However,
the stomach (gastroparesis), small bowel (bacterial overgrowth
and pseudo-obstruction), and colon and rectum (decreased
motility, megacolon, fecal incontinence and impaction, rectal
prolapse, and anorectal sphincter dysfunction) also may be
affected. Pancreatic exocrine secretion may decrease.
Telangiectasias and diverticula may be found throughout the
gastrointestinal tract, including gastric antral vascular ectasia,
which is associated with connective tissue disease in general.
Mild increases in aminotransferase levels, autoimmune liver
disease, nodular regenerative hyperplasia, and primary biliary
cirrhosis may be associated with scleroderma, as in other connective tissue diseases.
Gastrointestinal tract manifestations may occur in other
connective tissue disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis
(esophageal dysmotility; vasculitis with ischemic cholecystitis,

154

Section IV Miscellaneous Disorders

appendicitis, and colitis; and amyloidosis), systemic lupus erythematosus (esophageal dysmotility, gastrointestinal vasculitis, serositis, and pancreatitis), polymyositis (oropharyngeal
dysmotility, gut smooth muscle dysfunction, and vasculitis),
dermatomyositis (malignancies, including stomach, pancreas,
ovary, lung, and colorectal), and Sjögren’s syndrome (esophageal webs and pancreatic insufﬁciency). Rheumatoid arthritis
may be part of Felty’s syndrome (splenomegaly and neutropenia) with nodular regenerative hyperplasia and portal hypertension (variceal hemorrhage). Nodular regenerative
hyperplasia itself also occurs with scleroderma, myasthenia
gravis, celiac disease, Graves’ disease, sarcoidosis, polymyositis, Behçet’s syndrome, sickle cell disease, systemic lupus
erythematosus, Sjögren’s syndrome, polymyalgia rheumatica,
vasculitis, multiple myeloma, hypercoagulable states, and
lymphoproliferative or myeloproliferative syndromes.
Rheumatoid arthritis also is associated with liver disease,
including mild liver function test abnormalities, autoimmune
chronic hepatitis, primary biliary cirrhosis, and amyloidosis
(see below). Sjögren’s syndrome is associated with autoimmune chronic hepatitis and primary biliary cirrhosis.
Patients with seronegative spondyloarthropathies may
have ileocolonic inﬂammation similar to that of Crohn’s disease. Systemic vasculitides, including Behçet’s syndrome (oral
and genital ulcers, gastrointestinal tract involvement similar
to that of Crohn’s disease, and Budd-Chiari syndrome),
polyarteritis nodosa (gallbladder, pancreas, appendix, and
ischemia involving the gastrointestinal tract; 50% of patients
have hepatitis B virus infection), Wegener’s granulomatosis
(gastrointestinal tract), and Churg-Strauss syndrome (gallbladder and gastrointestinal tract), can have diverse gastrointestinal and liver manifestations.
Pregnancy and Gynecologic Conditions

Pregnancy has many effects on the gastrointestinal tract. Nausea
and vomiting are extremely common during the ﬁrst trimester
of pregnancy. When these effects become protracted and severe
(hyperemesis gravidarum), dehydration, weight loss, malnutrition, and liver function test abnormalities may occur (see
Chapter 34, Liver Disease and Pregnancy). Risk factors include
young age, obesity, multiparity, multiple births, ﬁrst and
molar pregnancies, and previous hyperemesis gravidarum.
Hyperthyroidism must be excluded. Treatment is supportive,
and symptoms usually resolve by week 20 of pregnancy.
Gastroesophageal reﬂux disease also is common during
pregnancy because of the combined relaxing effects of estrogens and progestins on the smooth muscle of the body of the
esophagus and the lower esophageal sphincter. Once symptoms occur during a pregnancy, they often persist until term
and recur with subsequent pregnancies (see Chapter 21,
Gastrointestinal Disease and Pregnancy). Pregnancy appears
to decrease the frequency, severity, and risk of complications
of peptic ulcer disease. Constipation is another common gastrointestinal tract manifestation in pregnancy. Altered motility
(hormonal), altered diet, constipating medications (iron),

compression of the sigmoid colon by an enlarged uterus, and
decreased activity all contribute. Pregnancy is unlikely to cause
diarrhea. Small-bowel obstruction during pregnancy (about
1:1,500) is due most often to adhesions; volvulus is the second
most common cause, especially in the third trimester, when
incarcerated hernias are less common. Appendicitis is not
more common during pregnancy (about 1:1,500), but the
diagnosis often is delayed, with increased maternal (up to
11%) and fetal (up to 37%) mortality, especially late in pregnancy, when the enlarged uterus pushes the appendix and
cecum up into the right upper quadrant, resulting in atypical
signs and symptoms.
Endometriosis, if severe, often affects the gut; most frequently, the sigmoid colon is involved. It sometimes results in
obstruction (adhesions), perforation, bleeding, diarrhea, and,
more often, abdominal pain or constipation. These gastrointestinal tract symptoms may or may not be cyclical.
Associated gynecologic symptoms, such as pain with intercourse, are common. Estrogen administration after menopause may be associated with symptoms. Meigs’ syndrome
presents with ascites and, often, pleural effusion in association
with benign ovarian neoplasms.
Miscellaneous

Systemic amyloidosis includes AL amyloidosis (primary, associated with myeloma, B-cell lymphoma, and Waldenström’s
macroglobulinemia), AA amyloidosis (secondary, with
chronic infections and inﬂammation), familial forms, dialysisassociated amyloidosis (beta2-microglobulin), and senile amyloidosis. Localized forms of amyloidosis can involve the
gastrointestinal tract. Systemic forms can inﬁltrate the gastrointestinal tract, resulting in macroglossia (usually primary AL
amyloidosis), esophageal dysphagia or dysmotility, gastroesophageal reﬂux disease, gastroparesis, gastric ulceration,
tumors, obstruction, small- and large-bowel dysmotility or
pseudo-obstruction, diarrhea, malabsorption, bacterial overgrowth, bleeding, ischemia, ulceration, constipation, and fecal
incontinence. Liver involvement also is frequent, with hepatomegaly, increased alkaline phosphatase level, and, rarely,
severe intrahepatic cholestasis (usually primary AL amyloidosis) or liver failure. Pancreatic exocrine insufﬁciency also has
been described. Rectal, stomach, and liver (rare reports of
rupture) biopsy ﬁndings often are diagnostic. Chemotherapy
may be useful in treating primary AL amyloidosis, and colchicine may be useful in AA amyloidosis due to familial
Mediterranean fever (fever, serositis, arthritis, vasculitis, and
chest or abdominal pain; family history, recessive, chromosome band 16p13.3) and inﬂammatory bowel disease. Liver
transplantation may be helpful for certain familial forms
(ATTR or type I familial amyloid neuropathy, autosomal
dominant, mutant transthyretin protein) with symptoms, but
not after severe irreversible damage (especially neurologic)
has occurred.
Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type IV, usually autosomal dominant, is associated often with bowel perforation, vascular

aneurysms, arteriovenous ﬁstulas, and rupture. Paraneoplastic
syndromes with diffuse gastrointestinal tract motor dysfunction occur most often with small cell lung carcinoma, often
with autonomic neuropathy, cerebellar degeneration, peripheral neuropathy, seizures, or syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone. Antineuronal nuclear antibodies,
type 1, usually are detectable.

IV.6. An 85-year-old man presents with melena with three
stools over 12 hours. He has a history of compensated
congestive heart failure and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and uses home oxygen at night. He
takes one aspirin tablet daily. Endoscopy is performed
in the emergency department, and he is found to have
an adherent clot over a large ulcer in the posterior
duodenal bulb. Endoscopic therapy is not applied;
instead, he is given continuous IV infusion of a proton
pump inhibitor.
The bleeding stops, and the patient receives transfusion with 2 units of packed red blood cells with stable
hemoglobin. On day 3, he develops hematochezia with
tachycardia and hypotension that corrects with volume
replacement. After volume replacement, the hemoglobin concentration decreases 2 g. Repeat endoscopy
shows an ulcer in the posterior bulb with a 2.5-mm
visible vessel. The best treatment option at this point
would be:
a. Perform endoscopic clipping
b. No endoscopic therapy, continue treatment with
proton pump inhibitor
c. Refer for surgical oversewing of the ulcer
d. Inject epinephrine, followed by heater probe therapy
e. Place an endoscopic clip adjacent to the ulcer to localize it, and proceed to angiographic embolization of
the vessel
IV.7. A 72-year-old man presents with a history of three
black stools over 24 hours. This is his second admission for melena in 2 months. On his last admission, he
received transfusion with 4 units of packed red blood
cells, and ﬁndings on esophagogastroduodenoscopy
and colonoscopy into his terminal ileum were negative. The results of capsule endoscopy performed in an
outpatient setting 3 weeks after the bleeding episode
were negative. He has hypertension, chronic renal

failure, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,
with an FEV1 of 0.95 L. He had myocardial infarction
5 years ago and has congestive heart failure, with an
ejection fraction of 22%. He takes 81 mg of aspirin
daily. His pulse rate is 95 beats/minute, and blood
pressure is 150/75 mm Hg, with minimal change with
standing. Laboratory values include hemoglobin 9.7 g/
dL, ferritin 18 μg/L, blood urea nitrogen 20 mg/dL,
and creatinine 2.4 mg/dL. Which of the following is
the next best step?
a. Repeat esophagogastroduodenoscopy and colonoscopy if ﬁndings are negative
b. Repeat capsule endoscopy
c. Perform CT enterography
d. Perform balloon-assisted endoscopy peroral approach
e. Perform small-bowel follow-through study
IV.8. A 55-year-old woman presents with hematemesis,
orthostasis, and tachycardia, and after rehydration,
the hemoglobin level is 10 g/dL. Findings with upper
endoscopy are normal. She has no history of nose
bleeding. She takes low-dose aspirin and ibuprofen,
on average four 200-mg tablets per week. Four weeks
earlier, the patient was admitted to the hospital with
melena and required transfusion with 2 units of blood.
Findings with both upper endoscopy and colonoscopy
at that time were normal, and there has been no ensuing bleeding. The most likely source of bleeding is:
a. Gastric Dieulafoy’s lesion
b. Gastric varices
c. A 2-cm antral ulceration
d. Esophageal varices
e. Large vascular ectasia in the gastric antrum
IV.9. An 80-year-old man who takes a low dose of aspirin
presents with a history of three black, mushy stools
over the past 12 hours. He takes 81 mg of aspirin daily
and has known coronary artery disease. A coronary
artery stent was placed 4 years ago. He has no abdominal pain or known liver disease. His blood pressure is
105/80 mm Hg and decreases to 90/60 mm Hg with
standing. His pulse at rest is 100 beats/minute and
increases to 120 with standing. Hemoglobin is 12.5 g/dL,
with a mean corpuscular volume of 82 fL. Laboratory
values include sodium 138 mEq/L, potassium
4.9 mmol/L, blood urea nitrogen 45 mg/dL, and creatinine 1.0 mg/dL. The ratio of prothrombin time to activated partial thromboplastin time is normal. Alanine
aminotransferase is 75 U/L. Alkaline phosphatase,
bilirubin, and albumin values are normal. The most
likely source of blood loss would be:
a. Sigmoid adenocarcinoma
b. Ascending colon diverticula
c. Cecal vascular ectasia
d. Gastric antral vascular ectasia
e. Duodenal ulcer

Answers

IV.1. Answer b.
This patient’s symptoms are likely due to a viral
infection. Cryptosporidiosis and Giardia infection
would not produce such a wide variety of symptoms and
laboratory ﬁndings. Early in the course of primary infection with HIV-1, testing for plasma levels of the virus
will be positive. Also, early in the course, blood CD4
lymphocyte counts are normal and HIV-1 antibodies
are not detectable in the plasma (window period).
IV.2. Answer d.
The clinical scenario suggests a chronic inﬁltrative
disorder such as non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (almost
always B-cell lineage), Kaposi’s sarcoma, Mycobacterium
(avium-intracellular or tuberculosis) infection, or fungus
(histoplasmosis) infection. Yersinia and Aeromonas can
involve the distal ileum and right colon, but these are
not more common in HIV-infected persons and usually
are not this chronic. Although enteroaggregative E coli is
more common in HIV-infected than in non-HIV–
infected persons, it is not this chronic and would not
produce bulky, enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes.
IV.3. Answer e.
Both Giardia and enteroaggregative E coli infections can
cause diarrhea, which could last 5 weeks in the case of
Giardia in this nonimmunosuppressed HIV-infected
patient receiving HAART, and both could occur as a
result of travel. However, neither infection would be
associated with the mucosal changes as described in the
small-bowel biopsy specimen. Isospora, Cryptosporidium, and Cyclospora infections all could cause diarrhea
and the histologic ﬁndings, but Isospora would be
expected to produce eosinophilia and eosinophils or
Charcot-Leyden crystals in the stool. Cryptosporidium
infection would likely not last 5 weeks, and extracytoplasmic but intracellular sporozoites would likely be
evident in a small-bowel biopsy specimen (salt and

pepper lesions). With Isospora and Cyclospora infections, intracellular parasitic bodies might be more difﬁcult to demonstrate with standard histologic staining of
small-bowel biopsy specimens. Infection with Cyclospora
often persists for weeks, even in healthy persons.
IV.4. Answer c.
Atovaquone is the only choice not associated with an
increased risk of pancreatitis. Inhaled pentamidine is no
less risky than intravenous pentamidine.
IV.5. Answer d.
HIV-infected bisexual men and men who have sex with
men plus anal infection with human papillomavirus are
at greatest risk for anal squamous cell carcinoma.
Gonorrhea, syphilis, and infections with CMV, herpes
simplex virus, or Chlamydia do not appear to be risk
factors.
IV.6. Answer e.
In animal models, endoscopic therapy has not been
highly successful in treating vessels larger than 2 mm.
Further bleeding has been reported in more than onehalf of treated patients with vessels larger than 2 mm.
The efﬁcacy of angiographic therapy is similar to that of
surgery but with less morbidity and mortality, particularly in elderly patients with comorbid conditions.
IV.7. Answer b.
Capsule endoscopy has a much higher yield for localizing the source of blood loss if performed within the ﬁrst
2 weeks after the active bleeding. It has been reported to
identify the location of bleeding in more than 90% of
cases if performed within the ﬁrst 48 hours. The role of
CT enterography in identifying obscure bleeding is
evolving, but with the increased level of creatinine, this
method would not be the best choice. Double balloon
endoscopy certainly can be performed in this setting,
but because of the patient’s comorbid conditions,
161

162

Section IV Miscellaneous Disorders

it would be better to allow capsule endoscopy to direct
the double-balloon endoscopic approach from either
peroral or per rectum.
IV.8. Answer a.
The patient has had two episodes of clinically important obscure upper gastrointestinal tract bleeding.
The hematemesis strongly implicates an upper gastrointestinal tract source of the blood loss. This degree of
blood loss has been acute and severe, consistent with
arterial bleeding. It is unlikely that a large ulcer, a larger
vacular ectasia, or esophageal varices would be missed
on two endoscopic studies. Bleeding from gastric
varices certainly is possible because they can be overlooked on endoscopy; however, bleeding from a gastric Dieulafoy’s lesion is the most likely cause of the
blood loss in this patient. Typically, these lesions are
very difﬁcult to identify when not actively bleeding,
and 75% of them are in the proximal stomach, which
would be a likely location for hematemesis in this
patient.
IV.9. Answer e.
The increased ratio of blood urea nitrogen to creatinine and evidence of orthostasis strongly suggest an
upper gastrointestinal tract source of blood loss. This
is an episode of acute bleeding, which can be seen with
gastric antral vascular ectasia but is more likely with a
bleeding duodenal ulcer.
IV.10. Answer d.
The presentation of abdominal pain, followed by diarrhea and then small-volume rectal bleeding, is typical
for ischemic colitis disease. A patient with E coli
O157:H7 colitis may present with watery diarrhea,
followed by bloody diarrhea, but this typically occurs
over several days rather than over several hours, as in
ischemic colitis. Although pain can occur with E coli
O157:H7 colitis, it is seldom the chief complaint.
Diverticular bleeding and colonic ectasia bleeding typically are painless. A patient with maroon stools from
bleeding of a duodenal ulcer generally would present
with orthostasis.
IV.11. Answer b.
The arc of Riolan, also known as the meandering mesenteric artery, connects the superior mesenteric arterial circulation with the inferior mesenteric arterial
circulation at the base of the mesentery, as does the
marginal artery of Drummond, along the mesenteric
border. The arc of Barkow, the arc of Buhler, and the
pancreaticoduodenal arcade connect the superior
mesenteric artery circulation with the celiac artery circulation. The ileocolic artery is a branch of the superior mesenteric artery and does not provide collaterals
to other major arterial circulations.

IV.12. Answer d.
The clinical scenario is most consistent with acute
mesenteric ischemia due to new atrial ﬁbrillation, with
acute, constant severe pain that is out of proportion to
the minimal abdominal tenderness to palpation. Anticoagulation would be recommended. A standard CT
scan early in the course of acute mesenteric (smallbowel) ischemia can be normal; standard CT is less
sensitive than multidetector CT angiography. Both of
these radiologic tests may miss small peripheral emboli,
but mural abnormalities are much more likely to be
observed with multidetector CT angiography. Persons
with food poisoning usually have vomiting or diarrhea. In acute pancreatitis, the pain usually is more
upper abdominal, with tenderness and vomiting. Early
on in the course of acute pancreatitis, the serum level
of lipase is unlikely to be signiﬁcantly increased if the
serum level of amylase is normal. Exposure to monosodium glutamate in some persons can cause nausea,
vomiting, diarrhea, and ﬂushing. Acute abdominal
porphyria (answer e) can present with similar pain out
of proportion to tenderness, but it is rare and would
not explain the irregularly irregular pulse.
IV.13. Answer b.
This clinical case is most consistent with a malignancy
and isolated fundic gastric varices, which suggest isolated splenic vein thrombosis. Superior mesenteric
vein thrombosis alone could account for the patient’s
recent symptoms but not for the varices and hematemesis. Thrombosis of the portal, superior mesenteric,
and splenic veins would likely result in esophageal
varices, as would cirrhosis with hepatocellular carcinoma. Renal carcinoma with thrombosis extending
into the inferior vena cava would not be expected to
produce isolated fundic gastric varices.
IV.14. Answer c.
The clinical presentation and endoscopic and histologic ﬁndings in this patient suggest ischemic colitis.
Her age makes idiopathic ischemic colitis unlikely.
Although the birth control pill may increase her risk of
venous thrombosis, inferior mesenteric venous thrombosis is unusual. There is no history of antibiotic exposure to suggest C difﬁcile infection. Salmonella colitis
and ischemic colitis have different histologic features.
Her profession, as well as the severity and persistence
of the bloody diarrhea, favors E coli O157:H7 infection, which can mimic ischemic colitis clinically, endoscopically, and histologically.
IV.15. Answer e.
The clinical presentation is most consistent with
Henoch-Schönlein purpura, a leukocytoclastic vasculitis with IgA deposition in multiple organs. The acute
clinical course and palpable purpura would be unusual

Questions and Answers

for B-cell lymphoma, Crohn’s disease, rheumatoid
arthritis, or mesenteric ischemia.
IV.16. Answer e.
The patient’s clinical presentation is most consistent
with amyloidosis. Fundic gland polyps would not produce organomegaly, diarrhea, or early satiety. Most
small gastric carcinoid tumors are not associated with
carcinoid syndrome and are not friable. β2-Microglobulin amyloid is associated with long-term renal
replacement therapy. She has no chronic disease to
cause AA type amyloid deposits, and most likely has
AL type amyloid, which frequently involves the gastrointestinal tract, often with macroglossia, gut dysmotility, bacterial overgrowth, and diarrhea.
IV.17. Answer b.
The patient’s presentation is consistent with an acute
attack of porphyria. Tachycardia, neuropathic abdominal pain, and hyponatremia support the diagnosis.
Her use of a birth control pill could be a precipitant.
During an acute attack, urinary porphobilinogen
should be increased above normal levels. The blisters
on the dorsum of her hands suggest that this is not
acute intermittent porphyria; thus, the erythrocyte
porphobilinogen deaminase level should be normal.
Because of the attacks of pain, this is not porphyria
cutanea tarda; consequently, the erythrocyte uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase level should not be
decreased. Nor is this erythropoietic protoporphyria;
thus, the erythrocyte protoporphyrin level should not
be greatly increased. Fecal coproporphyrin would be
increased whether this patient has hereditary coproporphyria or variegate porphyria, both of which include
acute attacks and skin symptoms.

163

IV.18. Answer b.
This patient has symptomatic granulomatous antral
gastritis. By history and with the minimal inﬂammation seen in the biopsy specimen, Crohn’s disease
(answer c) and ulcerative colitis (answer e) are unlikely.
Granulomas are not typical with the use of nonsteroidal antiinﬂammatory drugs (answer d). Syphilis is also
unlikely (answer a). This patient most likely has granulomatous gastritis due to sarcoidosis, with an increase
in 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D level due to macrophage
synthesis, resulting in mild hypercalcemia.
IV.19. Answer e.
Acanthosis nigricans and dermatomyositis (answer e)
may occur in persons with adenocarcinoma of the
stomach. Facial ﬂushing (carcinoid), dermatographism (systemic mastocytosis), easy bruising (amyloidosis, answer c), and porphyria cutanea tarda (answer
d) would not be expected.
IV.20. Answer d.
The clinical presentation is most consistent with acute
graft-versus-host disease, with involvement of the gastrointestinal tract, liver (cholestatic pattern), and skin
(rash). The timing of the presentation is a little late for
sinusoidal obstruction syndrome, which would not
include the rash or diarrhea. Recurrent leukemia
is unlikely, and the vanishing bile duct syndrome
(answer c) presents much later (80–400 days after
transplantation). The low level of albumin, bloating,
and diarrhea suggest gastrointestinal tract involvement

Inﬂammatory Bowel Disease:
Clinical Aspects
David H. Bruining, MD, and William J. Tremaine, MD

Inﬂammatory bowel disease (IBD) remains a vexing clinical
challenge. It is a disease process characterized by chronic
idiopathic intestinal inﬂammation. The two main subtypes
are ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease. Ulcerative colitis
involves the colonic mucosa, extending proximally from the
anal verge in an uninterrupted pattern to involve all or part of
the colon. Crohn’s disease is a disorder that typically affects
the full thickness of the intestine. Although it has a special predilection for involving the small bowel, the disease can occur
anywhere in the gastrointestinal tract from mouth to anus.
Typically, Crohn’s disease results in patchy inﬂammation with
intervening areas of normal mucosa. Both ulcerative colitis
and Crohn’s disease can be associated with extraintestinal
disease manifestations.

Epidemiologya

Men and women are generally at a similar risk for inﬂammatory bowel disease, with a higher overall incidence of Crohn’s
disease in females. Onset of IBD is highest among adolescents;
the peak incidence is between ages 15 and 25 years, with a
smaller second peak between the ﬁfth and seventh decades.
IBD is more common among Ashkenazi Jews than non-Jews.
Ulcerative colitis has historically been more common than
Crohn’s disease.
The incidence of ulcerative colitis is 8.3 per 100,000 in
Olmsted County, Minnesota, and 14.2 per 100,000 in
Winnipeg, Manitoba. The prevalence in Olmsted County,

Abbreviations: CT, computed tomography; IBD, inﬂammatory
bowel disease; MR, magnetic resonance

Minnesota, is 229 per 100,000. The proportion of patients
with ulcerative proctitis varies in different series from 17% to
49% of the totals.
The incidence of Crohn’s disease also varies among different reporting centers. It is 6.9 per 100,000 in Olmsted County
and 14.6 per 100,000 in Winnipeg. The prevalence in Olmsted
County is 133 per 100,000.
Mortality rates of persons with IBD may be slightly higher
than those for the general population. In a study from
Stockholm, the standardized mortality ratio was 1.37 for
ulcerative colitis and 1.51 for Crohn’s disease.

Genetics

The genetic inﬂuence on the development of IBD is a topic of
considerable interest. Between 10% and 15% of patients with
ulcerative colitis have a relative with IBD, mainly ulcerative
colitis and, less commonly, Crohn’s disease. Approximately
15% of patients with Crohn’s disease have a relative with IBD,
mainly Crohn’s disease and, less commonly, ulcerative colitis.
The phenotypic concordance appears to be higher for Crohn’s
disease. Several genetic linkages have been identiﬁed, and speciﬁc genetic defects have been determined in IBD. The ﬁrst to
be characterized was the CARD15/NOD2 gene, present in the
homozygous form in up to 17% of patients with Crohn’s disease. This genetic defect is associated with ﬁbrostenotic disease involving the distal ileum. Other associations are with the
IBD5 haplotype of chromosome 5 and the IL23R gene on
chromosome 1p31. The latter gene encodes a proinﬂammatory cytokine, interleukin-23. Three genetic syndromes are
associated with IBD: Turner’s syndrome, Hermansky-Pudlak
syndrome (oculocutaneous albinism, a platelet aggregation
defect, and a ceroid-like pigment deposition), and glycogen
storage disease type 1B.

Diet

Diagnosis

Patients with IBD have no speciﬁc dietary restrictions.
Although lactose intolerance is more common among patients
with Crohn’s disease than among the general population,
lactose and other milk components do not seem to inﬂuence
the inﬂammatory disease. Elemental diets and parenteral
hyperalimentation are useful for correction of malnutrition
and for growth failure in children with IBD. Parenteral nutrition has not been found to be superior to enteral nutrition for
Crohn’s disease. The role of enteral and parenteral nutrition
as primary therapy for Crohn’s disease is controversial, and
they are used primarily as an alternative to corticosteroids.
There is no convincing evidence that elemental or parenteral
nutrition is therapeutic for ulcerative colitis.

The diagnosis of IBD is conﬁrmed by a combination of endoscopic, radiographic, and pathology studies. The speciﬁc diagnostic tests are based on the presenting symptoms and physical
examination ﬁndings.

Pregnancy

Fertility is normal in patients with inactive IBD. Fertility is
decreased in some women with active IBD, but most patients
are able to conceive. Sulfasalazine causes reversible infertility
in men as a result of abnormalities of spermatogenesis and
decreased sperm motility. There is debate about the risk of
birth defects in the offspring of a parent with IBD. Although
most studies do not show an increased risk in association with
the disease or the treatments, one study found more birth
defects among the offspring of fathers with Crohn’s disease
treated with 6-mercaptopurine. The course of pregnancy is
usually normal, although there is increased chance of preterm
delivery and decreased birth weight. For women with IBD in
remission before pregnancy, two-thirds remain in remission
through the pregnancy and postpartum. Flares occur most
commonly during the ﬁrst trimester and postpartum. Previous
colectomy with an end-ileostomy or with a continent ileal
pouch does not preclude pregnancy, and for some women,
vaginal delivery is still an option. Increased infertility has been
reported in women after ileal pouch-anal anastomosis for
ulcerative colitis. There is no deﬁnitive evidence to support
the idea that breastfeeding is a protective factor against later
development of IBD.

Environmental Inﬂuences

Ulcerative colitis is primarily a disease of nonsmokers. Only
13% of patients with ulcerative colitis are current smokers,
and the rest are nonsmokers or former smokers. Pouchitis
after proctocolectomy with an ileal J pouch-to-anal anastomosis for ulcerative colitis is less common among smokers.
In contrast, patients with Crohn’s disease are more
commonly smokers than the general population, and smoking
increases the risk of symptomatic recurrences. IBD is more
common in colder climates than in warmer climates, and it is
more common in developed countries than in developing
countries.

Clinical Presentations
Ulcerative Colitis

The onset may be gradual or sudden, with an increase in bowel
movements and bloody diarrhea, fecal urgency, cramping
abdominal pain, and fever. The course is variable, with periods of exacerbation, improvement, and remission that may
occur with or without speciﬁc medical therapy. About half of
the patients have disease involving the left side of the colon to
some extent, including proctitis, proctosigmoiditis, and disease extending from the splenic ﬂexure distally. Constipation
with rectal bleeding is a presenting symptom in about 25% of
patients with disease limited to the rectum. Diarrhea may vary
from 1 to 20 or more loose or liquid stools a day, usually worse
in the morning and immediately after meals, and patients with
moderate or severe symptoms often have nocturnal stools.
Abdominal pain is usually cramping, which is worse after
meals or bowel movements. Anorexia, weight loss, and nausea
in the absence of bowel obstruction are common with severe
and extensive disease but uncommon with mild to moderate
disease or disease limited to the left colon. In children, urgency,
incontinence, and upper gastrointestinal tract symptoms are
more frequent and growth failure is common. Extraintestinal
symptoms occur in up to 36% of patients.
Crohn’s Disease

Symptoms depend on the anatomical location of the disease.
With ileocecal disease, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and fever are
typical. With colonic disease, bloody bowel movements with
diarrhea, weight loss, and low-grade fever are common.
Patients with gastroduodenal Crohn’s disease often have
burning epigastric pain and early satiety, and these symptoms
usually overshadow the symptoms from coexisting ileal or
colonic disease. The symptoms of oral or esophageal Crohn’s
disease include dysphagia, odynophagia, and chest pain, even
without eating. The ﬁndings of perianal Crohn’s disease
include perirectal abscesses, painful and edematous external
hemorrhoids, and anal and perianal ﬁstulas. Enterovesical ﬁstulas can cause pneumaturia and recurrent polymicrobial urinary tract infections. Rectovaginal ﬁstulas occur in up to 10%
of women with rectal Crohn’s disease and may cause gas or
stool to be passed from the vagina. In children, the onset of
Crohn’s disease is often insidious; weight loss occurs in up to
87% before the diagnosis is made, and 30% of children have
growth failure before the onset of intestinal symptoms.

14 Inﬂammatory Bowel Disease: Clinical Aspects

Physical Examination

In mildly active ulcerative colitis, physical examination ﬁndings are often normal or there may be abdominal tenderness,
particularly with palpation over the sigmoid colon. Patients
with more severe disease may have pallor (anemia), tachycardia (dehydration), fever, diminished bowel sounds, and diffuse abdominal tenderness with rebound. Tenderness with
rebound is ominous and suggests toxic dilatation or perforation. In Crohn’s disease, physical examination ﬁndings may
be normal or may include one or more of the following: fever,
weight loss, muscle wasting, abdominal tenderness (particularly in the lower abdomen), and a palpable mass, usually in
the ileocecal region of the right lower abdomen. Rectal examination may show large, edematous, external hemorrhoidal
tags; ﬁstulas; anal canal ﬁssures; and anal stenosis. Ulcers in
Crohn’s disease may occur on the lips, gingiva, or buccal
mucosa.

with systemic symptoms such as fever, malaise, and myalgias,
cytomegalovirus infection should be excluded by mucosal
biopsy studies, particularly if the patient is receiving therapy
with immunosuppressive agents.
Endoscopy

Laboratory Findings

In mild disease, laboratory results may be normal. Iron deﬁciency anemia due to gastrointestinal tract blood loss may
occur in ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease, and anemia of
chronic disease, presumably due to cytokine effects on the
bone marrow, may occur with either disorder. Malabsorption
of vitamin B12 or folate is an additional cause for anemia in
patients with Crohn’s disease. Hypoalbuminemia, hypokalemia, and metabolic acidosis can occur with severe disease
because of potassium and bicarbonate wasting with diarrhea.
An increased leukocyte count may be a consequence of active
IBD or be due to a complicating abscess.
Laboratory values of acute phase reactants, including the
erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein, can be
increased but may also be normal in mildly active disease. The
perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody is positive
in about two-thirds of patients with ulcerative colitis and
about one-third of patients with Crohn’s disease. The antiSaccharomyces cerevisiae antibody is positive in about twothirds of patients with Crohn’s disease and about one-third of
patients with ulcerative colitis. These tests may be used
together to help distinguish between ulcerative colitis and
Crohn’s disease. However, the positive predictive value of the
two tests together is 63.6% for ulcerative colitis and 80% for
Crohn’s disease; thus, distinguishing the two diseases with
these serologic tests is less than ideal (Table 14.1). Several
additional antimicrobial antibodies have been described,
including Escherichia coli outer membrane protein C (OmpC),
Bacteroides caccae TonB-linked outer membrane protein W
(OmpW), antibodies to CBir1 ﬂagellin (anti-CBir1), and
Pseudomonas ﬂuorescens-related protein (anti-I2). The usefulness and role of these markers in IBD diagnostic and management algorithms is being assessed. With new-onset IBD or at
relapse, infection should be ruled out with stool studies,
including cultures for bacterial pathogens and examinations
for ova and parasites and Clostridium difﬁcile toxin. For patients

Flexible proctosigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy can identify
characteristic mucosal changes of ulcerative colitis, including
loss of the normal vascular markings, mucosal granularity, friability, mucous exudate, and focal ulceration (Fig. 14.1). With
colonoscopy, the extent of disease can be determined and the
terminal ileum can be examined for evidence of backwash
ileitis in ulcerative colitis or ileal involvement in Crohn’s disease. Patients with left-sided ulcerative colitis may have
inﬂammatory changes around the appendix, referred to as a
cecal patch, as a manifestation of the disease; this ﬁnding
should not be confused with segmental colitis due to Crohn’s
disease. Only a limited examination of the rectosigmoid colon
should be performed in patients with severely active colitis

Figure 14.1 Diffuse changes of colitis with mucosal granularity,

erythema, and exudate. This is typical of moderately active
ulcerative colitis.

because of the risk of perforation. In Crohn’s disease, characteristic lesions at colonoscopy are deep linear ulcers (rake
ulcers) with surrounding erythema and granularity and skip
areas of normal-appearing mucosa between areas of involvement (Fig. 14.2). Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy can conﬁrm the presence and distribution of disease in the upper gut
and deﬁne how severely the mucosa is affected.
For patients with IBD who have extensive long-standing
colonic inﬂammation, the risk of malignancy is higher than
that for the general population. For that reason, periodic
colonoscopy with surveillance biopsies for dysplasia is indicated after 8 to 10 years of disease for patients who have extensive ulcerative colitis. The risk of malignancy for patients with
less extensive ulcerative colitis (with involvement of the colon
distal to the splenic ﬂexure) also is increased, but the magnitude of the risk has not been deﬁned. The risk of rectal cancer
for ulcerative proctitis without colitis above the rectum does
not appear to be increased. Patients with left-sided ulcerative
colitis or Crohn’s colitis (involving more than one-third of the
colon) should have periodic surveillance biopsies after 8 to 10
years of disease. The optimal interval between surveillance
examinations has not been deﬁned, and the examinations are
usually performed at 1- to 2-year intervals.
Radiologic Features

Plain abdominal ﬁlms with supine and upright views should
be obtained in cases of severely active colitis to examine for
complications, including perforation with free air or toxic
dilatation. In Crohn’s disease, computed tomographic (CT)
enterography (Fig. 14.3) or magnetic resonance (MR) enterography can assess the location and extent of small-bowel disease
and complications such as ﬁstulas, strictures, or abscesses. CT
enterography has been shown to have superior sensitivity and

speciﬁcity to traditional small-bowel follow-through images
for detecting active small intestinal inﬂammation. MR
enterography has the advantage of avoiding exposure to
ionizing radiation. Wireless capsule endoscopy may have a
role in evaluating some patients but should not be performed
if obstructive or stricturing disease is suspected, because of
the risk of capsule retention. A barium swallow may be
useful for assessment of Crohn’s disease that involves the
esophagus, stomach, and duodenum. MR imaging is the preferred imaging modality for identifying pelvic and perianal
abscesses.
Histology

Mucosal biopsy specimens from involved areas of the gastrointestinal tract are useful for excluding self-limited colitis and
other infections and noninfectious colitis causes such as
ischemia, drug effect, radiation injury, and solitary rectal
ulcer syndrome. Noncaseating granulomas are a feature
of Crohn’s disease and can be helpful in differentiating it
from ulcerative colitis, but even when multiple specimens are
taken, granulomas are identiﬁed in only 30% of specimens of
resected Crohn’s disease. The presence of focal, patchy inﬂammation is characteristic of Crohn’s disease but not invariably
identiﬁable.
Differential Diagnosis

Ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease must be differentiated
from infectious causes of colitis and also from the noninfectious causes of inﬂammation in the colon and small intestine
(Table 14.2). Microscopic colitis is a descriptive term for a syndrome of chronic watery diarrhea with characteristic histologic

abnormalities but without speciﬁc endoscopic or radiographic

inﬂammatory cells are present in the lamina propria, and collagenous colitis, which includes the features of lymphocytic
colitis plus the presence of a subepithelial collagen band.

171

Diverticular disease-associated chronic colitis is a segmental
colitis in which there are chronic inﬂammatory changes of the
mucosa limited to areas of the sigmoid colon where diverticula
are present.
Nonsteroidal antiinﬂammatory drugs can cause ulcerations
throughout the gastrointestinal tract, including the colon and
rectum, which can be confused with Crohn’s disease. Ischemia
more commonly causes segmental colitis that may be confused with Crohn’s disease, but occasionally it can cause a diffuse colitis that can appear as ulcerative colitis. Injury to the
rectum from radiation for prostate cancer or gynecologic
malignancy may appear similar to ulcerative proctitis or
Crohn’s disease with ﬁstulas and strictures. Injury to the small
intestine and more proximal colon from radiation may cause
chronic diarrhea, strictures, malabsorption, and other features
that may mimic extensive Crohn’s disease. Solitary rectal ulcer
syndrome may be confused with Crohn’s disease involving the
rectum but can be differentiated on the basis of histologic features showing marked subepithelial ﬁbrosis without inﬂammation. Diverticulitis may be confused with Crohn’s disease
when it presents with ﬁstulas, localized abscesses, and a segmental colitis.

Inﬂammatory Bowel Disease: Therapy
Sunanda V. Kane, MD

Many different medical and surgical therapies are available for
inﬂammatory bowel disease. Medical therapies include antiinﬂammatory drugs such as sulfasalazine, olsalazine, balsalazide, and mesalamine; antibiotics; corticosteroids, including
budesonide; immunosuppressive medications such as azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, methotrexate, cyclosporine, and
tacrolimus; and biotechnology medications such as antitumor necrosis factor (TNF) agents. Surgical therapies include
colectomy with ileostomy, ileoanal pouch, or Kock pouch for
ulcerative colitis and surgical resection, stricturoplasty, and
placement of setons for Crohn’s disease.
Many of the treatments for ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s
disease are designed to deliver medications topically to the
inﬂamed bowel, with the goal of achieving local efﬁcacy with
minimal systemic absorption, thus minimizing toxicity. A
thorough understanding of the anatomical classiﬁcation of
both ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease is required in order
to choose the optimal drug delivery system for a patient.
Ulcerative colitis can be divided into ulcerative proctitis
(rectal involvement only, with the maximal extent of 10 cm
from the anal verge), ulcerative proctosigmoiditis (inﬂammation is limited to the rectum and sigmoid colon), left-sided
ulcerative colitis (inﬂammation does not extend proximal to
the splenic ﬂexure), and extensive colitis or pancolitis (inﬂammation extends proximal to the splenic ﬂexure or involves the
entire colon). Crohn’s disease can be divided into Crohn’s ileitis (only the small bowel is involved), Crohn’s colitis (only the
colon is involved), and Crohn’s ileocolitis (both the small bowel
and colon are involved).a

Antiinﬂammatory Medications
(5-Aminosalicylates)

Sulfasalazine, oral mesalamine (Pentasa, Asacol, Lialda, and
Apriso), rectal mesalamine (Rowasa and Canasa), olsalazine,
and balsalazide are drugs that deliver 5-aminosalicylate
(mesalamine) to the colon (Table 15.1). Sulfasalazine, the ﬁrst
drug developed in this class, was designed to combine the
antiinﬂammatory properties of 5-aminosalicylate with the
antibacterial properties of sulfapyridine for the treatment
of rheumatoid arthritis. Subsequently, sulfasalazine was
discovered to be effective for ulcerative colitis and to serve
as a prodrug for the active ingredient 5-aminosalicylate.
5-Aminosalicylate is linked to sulfapyridine by an azo bond
that is cleaved by bacteria in the colon. Olsalazine and balsalazide are also prodrugs for 5-aminosalicylate. Olsalazine
consists of a dimer of two 5-aminosalicylate molecules linked
by an azo bond. Balsalazide consists of 5-aminosalicylate
linked to an inert carrier by an azo bond. Parent
5-aminosalicylate (mesalamine) can be delivered orally in a
capsule covered with the pH-dependent polymer Eudragit-S,
which dissolves at pH 7 in the terminal ileum and cecum
(Asacol), as ethylcellulose-coated granules that give a timed
release throughout the gastrointestinal tract, beginning in the
duodenum, jejunum, and ileum and ending in the colon and
rectum (Pentasa), as a tablet covered with the pH-dependent
polymer Eudragit-S, which dissolves at pH 7 in the terminal
ileum and cecum, exposing lipophilic and hydrophilic matrices that reportedly prolong mesalamine release throughout
the colon (Lialda), or in granulated form in a delayed and
extended formulation (Apriso). Mesalamine can be administered also as an enema (Rowasa) or a suppository (Canasa).
In placebo-controlled trials, sulfasalazine at doses of 2 to
6 g daily is effective in both inducing remission in mildly to
moderately active ulcerative colitis and maintaining remission. In comparative trials, sulfasalazine is less effective than
oral corticosteroids for active ulcerative colitis. In contrast,

Dose ranges reﬂect those commonly used in clinical practice and are broader than those speciﬁcally studied in clinical trials.

placebo-controlled trials of sulfasalazine at 3 to 5 g daily for
mildly to moderately active Crohn’s disease demonstrated
only modest efﬁcacy for inducing remission (this effect was
limited to patients with Crohn’s colitis or ileocolitis). In comparative trials, sulfasalazine was less effective than oral corticosteroids for active Crohn’s disease. Sulfasalazine at 2.5 to 3 g
daily was not more effective than placebo for maintaining
remission in Crohn’s disease. Drug-associated toxicity occurs
in up to 30% of patients receiving treatment with sulfasalazine. Commonly observed adverse events include headache,
epigastric pain, nausea and vomiting, and skin rash. Less
common but severe adverse events include hepatitis, fever,
autoimmune hemolysis, aplastic anemia, leukopenia, agranulocytosis, folate deﬁciency, pancreatitis, drug-induced lupus,
pneumonitis, and Stevens-Johnson syndrome. Reversible
male infertility may occur. Sulfasalazine may be taken during
pregnancy and breastfeeding.
Similar to those for sulfasalazine, placebo-controlled trials
of mesalamine enemas, 1 to 4 g daily, and mesalamine suppositories, 0.5 to 1.5 g daily, have demonstrated efﬁcacy for
both inducing remission in mildly to moderately active leftsided ulcerative colitis and ulcerative proctitis and maintaining remission. Oral mesalamine delivered to the terminal
ileum and cecum (Asacol and Lialda) at doses of 1.6 to 4.8 g
daily or throughout the gastrointestinal tract (Pentasa) at 2 to
4 g daily in patients with mildly to moderately active ulcerative

colitis is effective for inducing remission, and Asacol, 0.8 to
1.6 g daily, Pentasa, 4 g daily, and Apriso, 1.5 g daily, are effective for maintaining remission.
The data for use of oral mesalamine in the treatment of
Crohn’s disease are less clear. Placebo-controlled trials have
shown that low-dose mesalamine, 1 to 2 g daily, is not effective
for inducing remission in mildly to moderately active Crohn’s
disease. Data from placebo-controlled trials for high-dose
mesalamine, 3.2 to 4 g daily, for inducing remission in active
Crohn’s disease are conﬂicting (if there is beneﬁt, it is relatively small). A comparative trial demonstrated that oral
mesalamine is less effective than controlled ileal release (CIR)
budesonide, 9 mg daily, for active Crohn’s disease. Data from
placebo-controlled trials of oral mesalamine, 1 to 4 g daily, for
maintenance of medically induced remission or postoperative
remission of Crohn’s disease are conﬂicting (however, a metaanalysis has suggested a small beneﬁt for postoperative maintenance of remission). Oral mesalamine, 4 g daily, is not
steroid sparing.
Placebo-controlled trials have shown that olsalazine at 0.75
to 3 g daily is effective for inducing remission in patients with
mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis. Placebocontrolled trials have demonstrated that olsalazine at 1 g daily
is effective for maintaining remission in ulcerative colitis.
Comparative trials have shown that balsalazide at 6.75 g (contains 2.4 g of 5-aminosalicylate) daily has an efﬁcacy similar to

15 Inﬂammatory Bowel Disease: Therapy

that of oral mesalamine at 2.4 g daily for inducing remission in
mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis. Dose-response
trials demonstrated that balsalazide at 4 to 6 g daily is more
effective than balsalazide at 2 to 3 g daily for maintaining
remission in ulcerative colitis (this evidence of dose response
demonstrates a maintenance beneﬁt for balsalazide even
though a placebo-controlled trial has not been performed).
Olsalazine, balsalazide, and mesalamine generally are better
tolerated than sulfasalazine. Commonly occurring adverse
events include headache and gastrointestinal symptoms attributable to underlying inﬂammatory bowel disease. Sometimes,
rash, alopecia, and a hypersensitivity reaction resulting in a
syndrome of worsening diarrhea and abdominal pain may
occur. Rarely, serious adverse events, including interstitial
nephritis, pericarditis, pneumonitis, hepatitis, and pancreatitis, are observed. Periodic monitoring of renal function is recommended with long-term treatment with any mesalamine
formulation. Ileal secretory diarrhea can occur with olsalazine.
Olsalazine, balsalazide, and mesalamine may be taken during
pregnancy and breastfeeding.

Antibiotics

Controlled trials of various antibiotics, including vancomycin,
metronidazole, ciproﬂoxacin, and tobramycin, have not demonstrated efﬁcacy in treating ulcerative colitis. Thus, as a primary treatment for ulcerative colitis, antibiotic therapy is not
appropriate. The data for use of antibiotics in Crohn’s disease
are less clear cut. Three small underpowered comparative
studies suggested equivalence of either metronidazole or ciproﬂoxacin to sulfasalazine, methylprednisolone, and oral
mesalamine (Pentasa). However, a placebo-controlled trial of
metronidazole at 10 mg/kg daily or 20 mg/kg daily did not
demonstrate efﬁcacy in active Crohn’s disease. Similarly, a
comparative trial of budesonide 9 mg daily or combination
therapy with budesonide 9 mg + metronidazole 1.5 g + ciproﬂoxacin 1.0 g daily did not demonstrate an adjunctive role for
antibiotics in patients receiving budesonide therapy for active
Crohn’s disease. A single controlled trial of metronidazole,
1,500 mg daily for 3 months after ileal resection, showed that
the occurrence of severe endoscopic lesions could be delayed
for up to 1 year in patients undergoing an operation for
Crohn’s disease. Because of the results of these studies, the role
of antibiotic therapy for Crohn’s disease is debated. Many clinicians undertake a trial of antibiotic therapy before prescribing corticosteroids for active Crohn’s disease.
Uncontrolled studies have reported that metronidazole,
750 to 1,500 mg daily, and ciproﬂoxacin, 1,000 mg daily, may
be effective for ﬁstulizing Crohn’s disease, particularly in
patients with perianal ﬁstulas. No controlled trials have been
performed, but antibiotic therapy is used widely for this treatment indication and is considered to be the ﬁrst-line therapy.
Small placebo-controlled and comparative trials have
shown that metronidazole, 750 to 1,500 mg daily, and ciproﬂoxacin, 1,000 mg daily, are effective for inducing remission

175

in patients with active acute pouchitis after colectomy and
ileoanal anastomosis for ulcerative colitis. Uncontrolled clinical observations have suggested that metronidazole and ciproﬂoxacin may be effective for maintaining remission in patients
with chronic pouchitis.
Adverse events observed with metronidazole include paresthesias, peripheral neuropathy, yeast vaginitis, anorexia,
nausea, a metallic taste, and possible intolerance to alcohol.
Adverse events observed with ciproﬂoxacin include photosensitivity, nausea, rash, increased levels of liver enzymes, and
Achilles tendon rupture (rare). Ciproﬂoxacin should not be
taken during pregnancy or breastfeeding, but metronidazole
can be taken for short courses during pregnancy.

Corticosteroids

A small number of pharmacologic studies have been conducted with corticosteroids in inﬂammatory bowel disease,
and they can be used to guide dosing and route of administration. A dose-response study in patients with active ulcerative
colitis demonstrated that prednisone at doses of 40 or 60 mg
daily is more effective than prednisone at 20 mg daily. More
adverse events occurred in the 60-mg daily dose group. These
results have been extrapolated to patients with Crohn’s disease. Most clinicians initiate oral corticosteroid therapy with
prednisone at a dose of 40 mg daily and then taper the dose
over 2 to 4 months. Pharmacokinetic studies in patients with
active ulcerative colitis have demonstrated decreased bioavailability of prednisolone compared with that of controls. Thus,
patients with severely active ulcerative colitis or Crohn’s disease who do not have a response to oral corticosteroid therapy
are hospitalized and given corticosteroids intravenously to
ensure adequate bioavailability of the corticosteroid dose.
Placebo-controlled trials have demonstrated that orally
administered cortisone, 100 mg daily, or prednisone, 40 to
60 mg daily, is effective for inducing remission in mildly to
severely active ulcerative colitis. In contrast, placebo-controlled
trials have shown that low-dose oral corticosteroid therapy
(cortisone at 25 mg twice daily, prednisone at 15 mg daily, or
prednisone at 40 mg every other day) is not effective for maintaining remission in ulcerative colitis.
No controlled trials of intravenous corticosteroid therapy
for severely active ulcerative colitis have been conducted.
Uncontrolled studies have suggested that intravenous prednisolone, 60 mg daily, or hydrocortisone, 300 to 400 mg daily, is
effective for severely active ulcerative colitis. Most clinicians
administer methylprednisolone, 40 to 60 mg daily, intravenously as a single bolus dose, in divided doses (2-4 times
daily), or as a continuous infusion.
Placebo-controlled trials have demonstrated that hydrocortisone administered rectally as an enema at a dose of
100 mg daily or prednisolone at a dose of 5 mg daily is effective
for inducing remission in mild to moderately active left-sided
ulcerative colitis or ulcerative proctitis. Placebo-controlled
trials also have shown that hydrocortisone enemas at a dose

176

Section V Colon

of 100 mg two nights per week are not effective for maintaining remission in left-sided ulcerative colitis or ulcerative
proctitis.
Placebo-controlled trials have demonstrated that oral
prednisone administered at a dose of 60 mg daily and
6-methylprednisolone at 48 mg daily are effective for inducing
remission in mildly to moderately active Crohn’s disease.
In contrast, placebo-controlled trials have shown that lowdose corticosteroids (oral prednisone, 20 mg daily, or
6-methylprednisolone, 8 mg daily) are not effective for maintaining remission in Crohn’s disease.
Both short-term and long-term adverse events occur frequently in patients receiving corticosteroid therapy. Shortterm adverse events include weight gain, moon face, acne,
ecchymoses, hypertension, hirsutism, petechial bleeding,
striae, and psychosis. Long-term adverse events include diabetes mellitus, increased risk of infection, osteonecrosis, osteoporosis, myopathy, cataracts, and glaucoma. Corticosteroids
may be taken during pregnancy and breastfeeding.
Budesonide is a newer corticosteroid, with 90% ﬁrst-pass
metabolism in the liver. It can be administered orally as a CIR
formulation (release is pH dependent) or rectally as a compounded enema. These “topical” formulations have fewer
adverse events than conventional corticosteroids. A placebocontrolled trial demonstrated that CIR budesonide at doses of
9 to 15 mg daily is effective for inducing remission in mild to
moderately active ileal or right colonic Crohn’s disease.
Comparative studies have shown that oral CIR budesonide at
9 mg daily is more effective than mesalamine at 4 g daily and
equivalent to oral corticosteroids for inducing remission in
active Crohn’s disease. In contrast, oral CIR budesonide at
3 mg daily is not effective for maintaining remission in Crohn’s
disease and 6 mg has only a modest short-term maintenance
beneﬁt.

Azathioprine and 6-Mercaptopurine

Azathioprine is a prodrug that, after being administered, is
converted rapidly to 6-mercaptopurine. 6-Mercaptopurine,
then, is either inactivated to 6-thiouric acid by xanthine oxidase or to 6-methylmercaptopurine by thiopurine methyltransferase, or it is activated through several enzyme steps to
the 6-thioguanine nucleotides, which are thought to be the
active metabolites. The enzyme activity of thiopurine methyltransferase is determined genetically: 1 in 300 patients (0.3%)
have no enzyme activity, 10% have intermediate enzyme activity, and 90% have normal enzyme activity.
Placebo-controlled trials have demonstrated that azathioprine at doses of 1.5 to 2.5 mg/kg daily are effective for steroidsparing in patients with steroid-dependent ulcerative colitis.
Similarly, a placebo-controlled trial showed that azathioprine
at 100 mg daily is effective for maintaining remission in ulcerative colitis, and another trial showed that azathioprine at
2.0 mg/kg daily was more effective than oral mesalamine at
3.2 g daily for this indication.

Placebo-controlled trials have demonstrated also that azathioprine at doses of 2 to 3 mg/kg daily and 6-mercaptopurine
at a dose of 1.5 mg/kg daily are effective for inducing remission and closing ﬁstulas in patients with active Crohn’s disease. Similarly, placebo-controlled trials have shown that
azathioprine at 2 to 3 mg/kg daily and 6-mercaptopurine at
1.5 mg/kg daily are effective for maintaining remission in
Crohn’s disease and are steroid sparing.
Adverse events that have been associated with azathioprine
and 6-mercaptopurine include fever, nausea, allergic reactions,
pancreatitis, arthralgias, bone marrow suppression, hepatitis,
and infectious complications. Patients with inﬂammatory
bowel disease treated with azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine
have approximately a fourfold increase in the risk of lymphoma. Azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine can be administered during pregnancy to maintain remission.
Methotrexate

A placebo-controlled trial demonstrated that methotrexate
administered orally at a dose of 12.5 mg weekly is not effective
for treating active ulcerative colitis or for maintaining remission.
Placebo-controlled trials have demonstrated that low-dose
oral methotrexate, 12.5 mg weekly, is not effective for inducing or maintaining remission in Crohn’s disease. In contrast,
as shown by placebo-controlled trials, higher-dose methotrexate, 25 mg weekly given intramuscularly and possibly 15 mg
weekly given orally, is effective for inducing remission in
patients with steroid-dependent and steroid-refractory active
Crohn’s disease. A placebo-controlled trial also showed that
methotrexate at doses of 15 to 25 mg weekly given intramuscularly is effective for maintenance of remission and steroidsparing in Crohn’s disease.
The adverse events that may occur with methotrexate therapy include rash, nausea, mucositis, diarrhea, bone marrow
suppression, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, increased levels of
liver enzymes, and liver ﬁbrosis or cirrhosis. Methotrexate is
contraindicated for pregnant women and can cause sperm
damage in men.
Cyclosporine and Tacrolimus

A placebo-controlled trial of intravenous cyclosporine administered as a continuous infusion at a high dose of 4 mg/kg daily
(equivalent to 12-16 mg/kg daily of oral cyclosporine) demonstrated efﬁcacy for inducing remission in patients with severely
active, steroid-refractory ulcerative colitis. A comparative trial
showed that monotherapy with moderate-dose intravenous
cyclosporine (2 mg/kg as a continuous daily infusion) has efﬁcacy similar to that of high-dose intravenous cyclosporine
(4 mg/kg as a continuous daily infusion) for inducing remission in patients with severely active ulcerative colitis. There
are no controlled trials of oral cyclosporine for the treatment
of active ulcerative colitis or for maintaining remission in

15 Inﬂammatory Bowel Disease: Therapy

ulcerative colitis. A placebo-controlled trial demonstrated that
oral tacrolimus titrated to a target whole blood level of 10 to
15 ng/mL was more effective than placebo for inducing remission in patients with severely active, steroid-refractory ulcerative colitis.
Placebo-controlled trials of cyclosporine administered
orally at a low dose of 5 mg/kg daily did not demonstrate efﬁcacy for inducing remission in active Crohn’s disease or for
maintaining remission in Crohn’s disease. There are no controlled trials of high-dose cyclosporine administered intravenously for severely active or ﬁstulizing Crohn’s disease.
A placebo-controlled trial of oral tacrolimus, 0.2 mg/kg
daily, demonstrated efﬁcacy for treatment of ﬁstulizing
Crohn’s disease.
The adverse events that may occur with cyclosporine
therapy include headache, tremor, paresthesias, seizures,
hypertrichosis, gingival hyperplasia, renal insufﬁciency, hypertension, infections, hepatotoxicity, nausea and vomiting, and
anaphylaxis. The adverse events that may occur with tacrolimus therapy include headache, tremor, paresthesias, renal
insufﬁciency, hypertension, infections, and diabetes mellitus.
Although not absolutely contraindicated, cyclosporine and
tacrolimus therapy generally should be avoided for pregnant
women.

Anti-TNF Agents

Inﬂiximab is a chimeric IgG1 monoclonal antibody directed
toward TNF-α. Adalimumab is a fully human IgG1 monoclonal antibody directed toward TNF-α. Certolizumab pegol is a
pegylated humanized antibody Fab′ fragment of TNF-α
monoclonal antibody. Controlled trials have shown that infliximab at 5 mg/kg administered 3 times over 6 weeks as an
intravenous infusion is effective for inducing remission and
closing ﬁstulas in active Crohn’s disease and for inducing
remission in patients with active ulcerative colitis. For patients
who have a response to induction therapy with inﬂiximab,
re-treatment with inﬂiximab at doses of 5 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg
administered intravenously every 8 weeks is effective for maintaining remission in Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis and
is steroid-sparing. Controlled trials have demonstrated that
adalimumab administered subcutaneously at a dose of 160 mg
at week 0 and 80 mg at week 2 is effective for inducing remission in active Crohn’s disease, including in patients who previously had a response to inﬂiximab therapy and then became
intolerant or lost response to it. For patients who have had a
response to adalimumab therapy, re-treatment with it at a
dose of 40 mg every other week or every week is effective for
maintaining remission in Crohn’s disease and is steroidsparing and can result in ﬁstula closure. Treatment of ulcerative colitis with adalimumab is investigational. Controlled
trials have demonstrated that certolizumab pegol delivered
subcutaneously at a dose of 400 mg at week 0 and week 4 controls active disease symptoms, including those of patients who
previously had a response to inﬂiximab. For those with a

177

response to certolizumab pegol therapy, 400 mg every 4 weeks
is effective in maintaining remission in Crohn’s disease and is
steroid sparing.
Adverse events that may occur with anti-TNF therapy
include formation of human anti-chimeric antibodies (inﬂiximab) or human anti-human antibodies (adalimumab or certolizumab pegol), infusion reactions (inﬂiximab), injection
site reactions (adalimumab or certolizumab pegol), delayed
hypersensitivity reactions (inﬂiximab), autoantibody formation, drug-induced lupus, infection (particularly tuberculosis
and fungal infections such as histoplasmosis), psoriasis, and
possibly non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. Human anti-chimeric
antibodies frequently lead to higher rates of infusion reactions
and loss of efﬁcacy in patients receiving inﬂiximab. The frequency of formation of human anti-chimeric antibodies in
patients receiving inﬂiximab is decreased when patients receive
1) three induction doses of inﬂiximab, followed by systematic
maintenance infusions every 8 weeks; 2) concomitant immunosuppressive therapy with azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine,
or methotrexate; or 3) pretreatment with 200 mg of hydrocortisone administered intravenously. Human anti-human
antibodies occur infrequently in patients receiving adalimumab and certolizumab pegol when they are given a loading
dose of adalimumab at weeks 0 and 2 and then systematic
maintenance injections. Although data are limited, anti-TNF
agents can be prescribed for pregnant women in selected
circumstances.
Natalizumab

Natalizumab is a humanized IgG4 monoclonal antibody to α4
integrins. Placebo-controlled trials have shown that the
administration of 300 mg intravenously once monthly induces
and maintains remission in patients with active Crohn’s disease. Steroid sparing has also been demonstrated, but not
enough data are available to assess the use of this agent for
ﬁstulas.
Natalizumab therapy has been associated with the development of multifocal leukoencephalopathy, a predominantly
fatal infection of the central nervous system by the JC
Polyomavirus. This risk appears to be 1 in 1,000 patients, particularly those receiving treatment with several immunosuppressive agents.
Surgery for Ulcerative Colitis

The original operation for ulcerative colitis consisted of total
proctocolectomy with Brooke ileostomy (Fig. 15.1). In the
1970s, the continent ileostomy, or Kock pouch, served as an
alternative to ileostomy (Fig. 15.1). Reoperation was frequently
required with the Kock pouch. In the 1980s, the ileoanal pouch
largely replaced the Kock pouch for patients with ulcerative
colitis who required operation and is the standard procedure
for the majority of patients (Fig. 15.1). Colectomy is indicated
for patients with ulcerative colitis who have colorectal cancer,

who are steroid-dependent, or who have disease refractory to
medical therapy (including severely active steroid-refractory
ulcerative colitis and toxic megacolon). Colectomy for deﬁnite
low-grade or high-grade dysplasia is debated and dependent
on other patient factors. Pouchitis is inﬂammation of the
ileoanal pouch that leads to recurrent symptoms of diarrhea,
urgency, and fecal incontinence. The cumulative frequency of
acute pouchitis after colectomy with ileoanal pouch approaches
50% by 5 years. The frequency of chronic pouchitis is 5% to
10% by 5 years.
The probability of surgical resection in patients with
Crohn’s disease increases with time. By 15 years after diagnosis, 70% of patients have had at least one operation, and onehalf of these have had two or more operations. In patients with
extensive stricturing or numerous previous operations (or
both), bowel-sparing techniques such as stricturoplasty may
be used (Fig. 15.2). In patients with perianal ﬁstulas complicated by abscess, a ﬁstulotomy or placement of setons (drains)
may be used in an attempt to avoid proctectomy.

Figure 15.2 Stricturoplasty for Crohn’s disease.

Treatment Strategies for Ulcerative Colitis
Induction of Remission

Sulfasalazine, oral mesalamine, olsalazine, and balsalazide are
effective for inducing remission in patients with active extensive or pancolonic ulcerative colitis. Patients with active ulcerative proctitis, ulcerative proctosigmoiditis, or left-sided
ulcerative colitis may receive treatment with rectal mesalamine enemas or suppositories, corticosteroid enemas, the oral
therapies outlined above for extensive and pancolonic ulcerative colitis, or a combination of oral and rectal therapy. For
patients who have disease that is moderate to severe and for
patients for whom sulfasalazine, oral or rectal mesalamine,
olsalazine, or balsalazide therapy failed, the next step is secondline therapy with prednisone. Patients with moderately active
disease can receive oral prednisone as an outpatient. Patients
who require corticosteroid therapy often become steroid
dependent. Patients with persistent symptoms may require

15 Inﬂammatory Bowel Disease: Therapy

oral corticosteroids, azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine, inﬂiximab, or colectomy with ileostomy or ileoanal pouch.
However, because of the slow onset of action, azathioprine
and 6-mercaptopurine have limited use as induction agents in
patients with signiﬁcantly active ulcerative colitis. Inﬂiximab
is effective for the treatment of active ulcerative colitis refractory to other therapies, usually corticosteroids or immunosuppressive medications (or both). Patients who are more
severely ill should be hospitalized for intravenous corticosteroid therapy, and if the disease does not respond, colectomy
should be performed (intravenous cyclosporine, oral tacrolimus, and inﬂiximab may be considered as alternatives to
colectomy). Methotrexate is not effective for ulcerative colitis,
and adalimumab is investigational for this condition.
Maintenance of Remission

Sulfasalazine, oral mesalamine, olsalazine, and balsalazide are
effective for maintaining remission in patients with extensive
or pancolonic ulcerative colitis. Patients with ulcerative proctitis, ulcerative proctosigmoiditis, or left-sided ulcerative
colitis can receive maintenance treatment with rectal mesalamine enemas or suppositories or with the oral therapies outlined above for extensive and pancolonic disease. Low-dose
prednisone is not effective for maintaining remission, and
patients who receive corticosteroid therapy for active ulcerative colitis often become steroid dependent. Azathioprine
and 6-mercaptopurine are effective for maintaining remission, particularly steroid-induced remission, and for steroidsparing. Inﬂiximab is effective for maintaining remission
in patients with disease refractory to other therapies.
Administration of three induction doses over 6 weeks and
then systematic maintenance dosing every 8 weeks with or
without concomitant immunosuppression decreases the frequency of human anti-chimeric antibody formation.
Methotrexate is not effective for ulcerative colitis, and adalimumab is investigational for this condition.

Treatment Strategies for Crohn’s Disease
Induction of Remission

Sulfasalazine is modestly effective for inducing remission in
patients with active Crohn’s disease, with the beneﬁt conﬁned
largely to patients with Crohn’s colitis and ileocolitis.
Mesalamine and metronidazole are not consistently effective
for inducing remission. Nevertheless, many clinicians continue to prescribe these agents for inducing remission in
patients with mild to moderately active Crohn’s disease.
Budesonide is more effective than mesalamine and similarly
effective to prednisone but safer. Thus, budesonide is the ﬁrstline treatment of choice for inducing remission in patients
with mildly to moderately active Crohn’s disease that involves
the terminal ileum or right colon, whereas sulfasalazine is
the optimal ﬁrst-line therapy for patients with Crohn’s colitis.

179

An evidence-based treatment algorithm for ﬁrst-line therapy
for Crohn’s disease is shown in Figure 15.3.
For patients who have moderate to severe disease and for
patients for whom budesonide or sulfasalazine therapy failed,
the next step is second-line therapy with prednisone. Patients
with moderately active disease can receive oral prednisone as
outpatients, but more severely ill patients should be hospitalized for intravenous corticosteroid therapy. Often, patients
who require corticosteroid therapy become steroid dependent. Because of the slow onset of action, azathioprine,
6-mercaptopurine, and methotrexate are of limited use as
induction agents in patients with signiﬁcantly active Crohn’s
disease. Anti-TNF agents are effective for the treatment of
active Crohn’s disease refractory to other therapies, usually
corticosteroids or immunosuppressive medications (or both).
Administration of three induction doses over 6 weeks and
then systematic maintenance dosing every 8 weeks with or
without concomitant immunosuppression reduces the frequency of human anti-chimeric antibody formation in patients
receiving inﬂiximab. Administration of two induction doses
over 2 weeks and then systematic maintenance dosing every
1 to 2 weeks results in a low rate of human anti-human antibody
formation in patients receiving adalimumab. Administration
of two induction doses over 2 weeks and then systematic
maintenance dosing every 2 to 4 weeks results in a low rate of
human anti-human antibody formation in patients receiving
certolizumab pegol.
Maintenance of Medically Induced Remission

Sulfasalazine is not effective for maintenance of medically
induced remission, and mesalamine is not consistently effective. Metronidazole has not been evaluated for this indication.
Low-dose prednisone is not effective for maintaining remission, and patients with active Crohn’s disease treated with corticosteroids often become steroid dependent. Budesonide,
6 mg, prolongs the time to relapse, but a maintenance effect as
deﬁned by conventional criteria has not been demonstrated.
Azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, and methotrexate are effective for maintaining remission, particularly corticosteroidinduced remission. Anti-TNF agents are effective for maintaining
remission in patients with disease refractory to other therapies.
Administration of three induction doses over 6 weeks and then
systematic maintenance dosing every 8 weeks with or without
concomitant immunosuppression decreases the frequency of
human anti-chimeric antibody formation in patients receiving
inﬂiximab. Administration of two induction doses over 2 weeks
and then systematic maintenance dosing every 1 to 2 weeks
results in a low rate of human anti-human antibody formation
in patients receiving adalimumab. Administration of two induction doses over 2 weeks and then systematic maintenance dosing
every 2 to 4 weeks results in a low rate of human anti-human
antibody formation in patients receiving certolizumab pegol.
A treatment algorithm for maintenance therapy in patients with
Crohn’s disease that is budesonide or prednisone dependent or
refractory is shown in Figure 15.4.

Postoperative Maintenance of Remission

Sulfasalazine is not effective for postoperative maintenance of
remission. Mesalamine is not consistently effective and is of
minimal beneﬁt. Metronidazole, 20 mg/kg for 3 months,
reduces the recurrence of severe endoscopic lesions at 3
months but does not alter clinical recurrence at 1 year, and
adverse events are common. Low-dose prednisone is not effective for postoperative maintenance therapy, nor is budesonide,
6 mg. Azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine may be effective,
but clinical data are sparse. In the absence of deﬁnitive data,
these agents are currently the treatment of choice for patients
who are deemed to be at “high risk” for recurrence.

Methotrexate and inﬂiximab have not been evaluated for
postoperative maintenance of remission. A treatment algorithm for postoperative maintenance therapy for patients with
Crohn’s disease is shown in Figure 15.5.

Controlled trials have not been performed. A placebo-controlled trial of tacrolimus did demonstrate effectiveness for

disease. Anti-TNF agents and natalizumab are effective for
both inducing and maintaining ﬁstula closure. Currently, infliximab is the best evidence-based therapy for ﬁstulas.
Administration of a loading dose, followed by systematic
maintenance therapy or concomitant immunosuppression
(or both), is required. An algorithm for the treatment of perianal Crohn’s disease is shown in Figure 15.6.

Inﬂammatory Bowel Disease: Extraintestinal
Manifestations and Cancer
Edward V. Loftus Jr, MD

Although ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease are idiopathic
inﬂammatory bowel diseases that by deﬁnition affect the gastrointestinal tract, they are associated with a wide variety
of systemic complications. Classically, such extraintestinal manifestations are deﬁned as immune-mediated phenomena that affect the joints, eye, skin, or hepatobiliary
tract, but they can be deﬁned more broadly to include complications in other organ systems and complications that arise
as a direct pathophysiologic consequence of extensive
bowel inﬂammation or resection. This chapter reviews
the most common extraintestinal manifestations, their relationship to activity of the underlying bowel disease, and their
treatment.
One of the complications of inﬂammatory bowel disease
most feared by patients and physicians alike is the development of colorectal cancer. Inﬂammatory bowel disease is associated less commonly with other malignancies, such as
cholangiocarcinoma. The risk of colorectal cancer may be
mitigated partially with colonoscopic surveillance. This chapter reviews risk factors for cancer and provides an algorithm
for surveillance colonoscopy.

Arthritisa

The overall prevalence of inﬂammatory bowel disease-related
rheumatologic manifestations is thought to be approximately
30%. Several types of arthritis have been identiﬁed, each with
its own clinical presentation, natural history, and treatment
(Table 16.1).

Abbreviations: FDA, US Food and Drug Administration; TNF,
tumor necrosis factor

Bowel Disease

Peripheral
Type 1 (oligoarticular)
Type 2 (polyarticular) (rare)
Metabolic bone diseases

Osteomalacia (rare)
Osteonecrosis (rare)

Arthritis affecting the axial skeleton can be classiﬁed into
the more common, frequently asymptomatic, sacroiliitis and
the less common, more progressive, ankylosing spondylitis.
Subtle inﬂammatory changes of the sacroiliac joints may be
detected with magnetic resonance imaging in up to 45% of
patients with inﬂammatory bowel disease, but most patients
are asymptomatic. Typical changes seen on plain radiographs
of the sacroiliac joints include narrowing of the joints and surrounding sclerosis. Symptomatic sacroiliitis manifests as low
back pain and stiffness, typically worse in the morning and
with rest. A subset progresses to ankylosing spondylitis, which
involves the vertebral facet joints and associated ligaments,
resulting in progressive stiffness and lordosis of the spine. The
prevalence of ankylosing spondylitis in inﬂammatory bowel
disease ranges between 1% and 6% across studies, with a
higher prevalence in Crohn’s disease than in ulcerative colitis.
The relationship between spondyloarthropathy, intestinal
inﬂammation, and classic inﬂammatory bowel disease is complex. Many patients with ankylosing spondylitis who have no
185

186

Section V Colon

gastrointestinal symptoms have evidence of subtle ileal inﬂammation, and symptomatic Crohn’s disease eventually develops
in 5% to 10% of these patients. Radiographic changes of ankylosing spondylitis include squaring of the vertebral bodies in
the early stages, followed by the classic “bamboo spine”
appearance of syndesmophytes between the vertebral bodies.
The HLA-B27 antigen is associated with ankylosing spondylitis in 50% to 75% of patients who have concomitant inﬂammatory bowel disease and ankylosing spondylitis. HLA-B27
positivity in patients with sacroiliitis implies a higher risk of
progression to ankylosing spondylitis.
The clinical course of the axial arthritides associated with
inﬂammatory bowel disease appears to be unrelated to the
activity of the underlying bowel disease. The course of ankylosing spondylitis is typically progressive even if the associated
inﬂammatory bowel disease is quiescent. The treatment of
ankylosing spondylitis has been revolutionized with the availability of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) antagonists. First-line
therapy consists of physical therapy directed at maintaining
spinal mobility, analgesics such as acetaminophen (with or
without mild opioid agents such as hydrocodone), and antiinﬂammatory agents if needed. Conventional nonsteroidal antiinﬂammatory drugs can be a problem because they may trigger
an exacerbation of inﬂammatory bowel disease. There is little
evidence that methotrexate is effective in treating ankylosing
spondylitis. In more resistant cases, an anti-TNF agent is indicated. Currently, etanercept (Enbrel), inﬂiximab (Remicade),
adalimumab (Humira), and golimumab (Simponi) have all
been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) for treating ankylosing spondylitis. Of these, only infliximab and adalimumab have FDA approval for at least one
form of inﬂammatory bowel disease.
The peripheral arthritis that occurs with inﬂammatory
bowel disease consists of two subtypes that are associated with
different HLA antigens. Type 1, the more common type, is an
asymmetric oligoarticular arthritis that affects primarily large
joints such as the knees, ankles, wrists, and elbows. The clinical presentation consists of joint pain and swelling, with limited range of motion. Plain radiographs typically do not show
destructive changes, although rarely they may be apparent.
Type 1 arthritis is usually self-limited, and its activity mirrors
the activity of the underlying inﬂammatory bowel disease.
Rarely, this form of peripheral arthritis becomes more chronic.
Type 2 arthritis is a more chronic symmetric polyarthritis,
similar to rheumatoid arthritis; however, rheumatoid factor is
typically absent. The activity of this arthritis is independent of
the associated inﬂammatory bowel disease. Initial treatment
of peripheral arthritis consists of physical therapy and analgesics. Nonsteroidal antiinﬂammatory drugs may exacerbate the
underlying inﬂammatory bowel disease. Sulfasalazine should
be considered the aminosalicylate of choice because it has mild
efﬁcacy for symptoms of peripheral arthritis. Corticosteroids,
administered by either oral ingestion or intra-articular injection, may be required. Considerable evidence supports the use
of methotrexate for treating peripheral manifestations of
spondyloarthropathy in patients with inﬂammatory bowel

disease. For refractory cases of peripheral arthritis, an antiTNF agent may be required.
The differential diagnosis for arthralgia in a patient with
inﬂammatory bowel disease who is receiving anti-TNF therapy is broad and includes partially treated inﬂammatory bowel
disease with associated spondyloarthropathy, delayed hypersensitivity reaction to the biologic agent (most often inﬂiximab), or drug-induced lupus-like reaction. A careful history
of the temporal association between arthralgias and the
administration of the anti-TNF agent should be documented.
Patients with lupus-like reaction will have positive antibodies
to either double-stranded DNA or histones.

Ocular Manifestations

Inﬂammatory ocular complications occur in 1% to 13% of
patients with inﬂammatory bowel disease (Table 16.2). The
most common forms are anterior uveitis (also known as iritis)
and scleritis. An inﬂammatory retinopathy or keratitis (corneal inﬂammation) may occur less frequently. Anterior uveitis
occurs in up to 6% of patients with inﬂammatory bowel disease and manifests with ocular pain, redness, photophobia, or
blurred vision. The presentation may be either acute or
chronic. The acute form is associated with HLA-B27 in 50% of
patients; the chronic form is not associated with any particular
HLA antigen. If the diagnosis is suspected, it should be conﬁrmed with a slit-lamp examination by an ophthalmologist.
(Indeed, any ocular symptoms in a patient with inﬂammatory
bowel disease should prompt referral to an ophthalmologist.)
The activity of the HLA-B27–associated form does not
necessarily correlate with the activity of the inﬂammatory
bowel disease, whereas the activity of the chronic form unrelated to HLA antigens typically mirrors the activity of
the bowel disease. A recent retrospective study suggested
that sulfasalazine treatment caused fewer exacerbations of
uveitis in the year after therapy was initiated than during
the previous year (from 3.4 to 0.9 ﬂares per year). If left
untreated, uveitis can result in irreversible complications such
as adhesions, cataracts, and glaucoma. Initial treatment consists of topical corticosteroids and cycloplegic agents. For
more refractory disease, oral corticosteroids may be required.
Recent studies have shown the steroid-sparing qualities of
methotrexate in this setting, and the results of open-label
studies of TNF inhibitors for the treatment of uveitis have
been promising.
Episcleritis and scleritis produce symptoms of eye irritation
(eg, burning and itching) and conjunctival erythema. The
activity of these conditions typically correlates with the activity of the inﬂammatory bowel disease. Initial treatment consists of topical corticosteroids, but oral corticosteroids may be
required for refractory scleritis. Again, because an untrained
physician cannot differentiate vision-threatening conditions
such as scleritis from nonthreatening conditions such as episcleritis, ocular symptoms in a patient with inﬂammatory
bowel disease should prompt referral to an ophthalmologist.

Some ocular complications may be treatment-related
(Table 16.2). The most common example is cataract formation after prolonged treatment with corticosteroids. The
cumulative incidence of cataract formation may be as high as
85% after 4 years of corticosteroid use. Less commonly, prolonged corticosteroid therapy may precipitate the development of glaucoma. Patients with inﬂammatory bowel disease
who have required prolonged courses of corticosteroids (ie,
several years) should have periodic eye examinations even if
they are asymptomatic.

Dermatologic Manifestations

The two most common dermatologic extraintestinal manifestations are pyoderma gangrenosum and erythema nodosum.
However, numerous other disorders of the skin have been
described in association with inﬂammatory bowel disease
(Table 16.3). Pyoderma gangrenosum is an idiopathic ulcerative skin disease that occurs in up to 12% of patients with
inﬂammatory bowel disease. It is manifested initially as a pustular lesion, which evolves to an ulcer with undermining borders. The lesion often exhibits “pathergy,” or a tendency to
worsen with trauma. The most common location is the lower
extremity, but the lesion can occur anywhere, including peristomal areas in patients with ostomies. Although skin biopsy
ﬁndings may be helpful in excluding other conditions, pyoderma gangrenosum has no pathognomonic histologic feaTable 16.3

tures, and the diagnosis is a clinical one. Bacterial and fungal
superinfection should be excluded. The course of pyoderma
gangrenosum is independent of the associated inﬂammatory
bowel disease. First-line treatment consists of oral corticosteroids. There should be a low threshold for institution of immunosuppressive therapies so that the dose of corticosteroids can
be tapered rapidly. The most commonly used immunosuppressive agents are cyclosporine and tacrolimus, although azathioprine and mycophenolate mofetil have been used
occasionally for more chronic lesions. Case reports and case
series have documented the efﬁcacy of inﬂiximab in treating
refractory pyoderma gangrenosum in both adult and pediatric
patients.
Erythema nodosum occurs more commonly in Crohn’s
disease (up to 15% of cases) but, rarely, may occur in ulcerative colitis (up to 5% of cases). For reasons that are unclear,
this complication is most likely to develop in young women.
The presentation is painful, tender, erythematous subcutaneous nodules, most typically in the pretibial areas. The activity
of erythema nodosum tends to correlate with that of the
underlying inﬂammatory bowel disease, and the lesions typically resolve with aggressive treatment of the bowel disease.
Supportive care for erythema nodosum includes leg elevation,
support stockings, bed rest, and nonsteroidal antiinﬂammatory drugs. Cutaneous Crohn’s disease refers to granulomatous lesions of the skin, most commonly in the perianal region.
When such changes occur distant to the perineum, they are
sometimes called metastatic Crohn’s disease. These lesions
occur as erythematous plaques or nodules. Disease activity
may not correlate with that of the underlying inﬂammatory
bowel disease, and treatment may be difﬁcult. Corticosteroids
and immunosuppressive therapy frequently are required.
Although anti-TNF agents have been approved for the
treatment of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, these drugs infrequently cause psoriasis-like skin lesions. Often, these lesions
can be treated successfully with topical corticosteroids, and
the anti-TNF therapy can be continued. However, more severe
manifestations may require cessation of treatment with the
biologic agent.
Oral manifestations of inﬂammatory bowel disease include
oral aphthous ulcers (which occur in up to 10% of patients
with Crohn’s disease) and, less commonly, mucosal cobblestoning of the buccal mucosa and palate and pyostomatitis
vegetans. The latter is characterized by pustules, erosions, and
plaques on the buccal and gingival mucosa.

Hepatobiliary Manifestations

The most important hepatobiliary condition associated with
inﬂammatory bowel disease is primary sclerosing cholangitis
(Table 16.4). This idiopathic chronic cholestatic liver disease
is characterized by inﬂammation and ﬁbrosis of the biliary
tree. Approximately 75% to 80% of all patients with primary
sclerosing cholangitis have associated inﬂammatory bowel
disease, and most of these have ulcerative colitis. Conversely,

2% to 7% of patients with ulcerative colitis and an even smaller
percentage of patients with Crohn’s disease have associated
primary sclerosing cholangitis. Patients present with pruritus
and jaundice in advanced stages of the condition; however,
with increased diagnostic awareness, the most frequent presentation in the modern era is in an asymptomatic patient
with inﬂammatory bowel disease who has abnormal results on
liver biochemistry tests. The presence of numerous strictures
and dilatations of the extrahepatic or intrahepatic biliary tree
found on endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography
most commonly conﬁrms the diagnosis. Liver biopsy may be
necessary for diagnosis in small duct primary sclerosing cholangitis (formerly known as “pericholangitis”). The inﬂammatory bowel disease associated with primary sclerosing
cholangitis is commonly mild in activity and almost always
pancolonic in extent. Rectal or even left-sided sparing and
“backwash ileitis” appear to be more common in primary
sclerosing cholangitis-related inﬂammatory bowel disease
than in typical ulcerative colitis, suggesting that primary sclerosing cholangitis-associated inﬂammatory bowel disease may
be a unique phenotype. The course of primary sclerosing cholangitis is completely independent of the underlying inﬂammatory bowel disease, and even total proctocolectomy is
thought to have no effect on its natural history. The disease
course is typically progressive, and there are no proven medical therapies. Orthotopic liver transplantation may be required.
Complications include acute cholangitis, formation of dominant biliary strictures, choledocholithiasis, and cholangiocarcinoma (see Chapter 30, Cholestatic Liver Disease).
Autoimmune hepatitis is associated rarely with inﬂammatory bowel disease, but when it is, it usually is associated with
ulcerative colitis. Some patients may have features of both
autoimmune hepatitis and primary sclerosing angitis (the
so-called overlap syndrome) (see Chapter 32, Autoimmune
Hepatitis).
Cholelithiasis is a common consequence of Crohn’s disease. Either inﬂammation or surgical resection of the distal
ileum impairs enterohepatic recycling of bile salts and upsets
the balance of bile salts, cholesterol, and phospholipids, lead-

ing to an increased tendency to form cholesterol crystals and
stones. Pigment stones also have been implicated in patients
with steatorrhea, most likely because of impaired enterohepatic circulation of bilirubin.
Osteopenia and Osteoporosis

Accumulating evidence strongly suggests that osteopenia and
osteoporosis are highly prevalent in inﬂammatory bowel disease (up to 50%–70% of patients, depending on the patients
studied and deﬁnitions used) (Table 16.1). Several factors may
have a role, including corticosteroid use, malabsorption of
calcium and vitamin D, malnutrition, low body mass index,
cigarette smoking, and increased concentrations of cytokines,
which contribute to bone resorption. However, conventional
risk factors for osteoporosis such as female sex, menopause,
and increasing age are equally important in patients with
inﬂammatory bowel disease. Although corticosteroid use is
thought by some investigators to be the most important risk
factor for osteoporosis in inﬂammatory bowel disease, vertebral compression fractures have been diagnosed occasionally
in patients with inﬂammatory bowel disease who have never
received corticosteroids. Bone loss associated with corticosteroid use is rapid, and the bulk of the loss occurs within the ﬁrst
several months of therapy. Unexpectedly, population-based
studies of patients with inﬂammatory bowel disease have
shown only a modestly increased risk of actual bone fracture
compared with that of the general population. The diagnosis
of osteoporosis is made with bone mineral densitometry (dual
photon absorptiometry). A T score of –2.5 (more than 2.5
standard deviations below mean bone mass for a young adult)
signiﬁes osteoporosis, and a T score between –1 and –2.5 signiﬁes osteopenia. There is as yet no consensus about which
patients with inﬂammatory bowel disease should have densitometry screening. Patients with inﬂammatory bowel disease
who have the usual risk factors for osteoporosis, including
postmenopausal state and low body mass index, should have
the screening test. Also, patients whose cumulative systemic
corticosteroid exposure is longer than 6 months should be
considered for testing. Treatment consists of calcium and vitamin D supplementation (1,200 mg calcium and 800 IU vitamin D), sex hormone replacement if deﬁcient, and an oral
bisphosphonate (alendronate, ibandronate, or risedronate).
For patients who are intolerant of oral bisphosphonates,
therapeutic options include intravenous bisphosphonates
(ibandronate, pamidronate, or zoledronic acid) intranasal calcitonin, or parenteral teriparatide (recombinant parathyroid
hormone) or denosumab (monoclonal antibody targeting the
RANK ligand).

Miscellaneous Complications

Renal complications are most common in Crohn’s disease
(Table 16.5). Nephrolithiasis may occur in up to 10% of
patients with Crohn’s disease, mostly a result of calcium oxalate

stone formation. Intestinal inﬂammation or resection cause
excessive absorption of oxalate. With fat malabsorption, the
intestinal luminal calcium, which normally binds to oxalate,
binds instead to fatty acids, leaving oxalate free to be absorbed
from the colonic lumen. Patients with ulcerative colitis, especially those who have had colectomy, have a slightly increased
tendency to form uric acid stones. Other renal complications
include glomerulonephritis, right ureteral obstruction due to
ileal inﬂammation, and enterovesical ﬁstula formation.
Interstitial nephritis can result from an idiosyncratic reaction
to 5-aminosalicylate products, and it is recommended that
renal function be assessed at baseline and monitored periodically thereafter.
Hematologic complications such as anemia, thrombocytosis, and leukocytosis are common. Anemia may be multifactorial (eg, iron or vitamin B12 deﬁciency and anemia of chronic
disease), and, rarely, it is a sign of an associated hematologic
disorder such as autoimmune hemolytic anemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, or promyelocytic leukemia.

189

Various cardiopulmonary complications have been
described, including pericarditis, myocarditis, conduction
abnormalities, eosinophilic pneumonia, and interstitial pneumonitis. Pericarditis and pneumonitis may arise both as a true
extraintestinal manifestation and as an allergic complication
of treatment with sulfasalazine or other 5-aminosalicylates.
In inﬂammatory bowel disease, pancreatitis most commonly occurs as a complication of medical therapy.
Azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine are the inﬂammatory
bowel disease drugs most likely to result in pancreatitis
(3%–5% of patients). Also, but rarely, acute pancreatitis has
developed after treatment with sulfasalazine or other
5-aminosalicylates. In patients with duodenal Crohn’s disease,
pancreatitis may result from a stricture or ﬁstula formation.
However, up to 50% of patients with inﬂammatory bowel disease have no obvious cause of pancreatitis, and a subset of
these may have a true extraintestinal manifestation. In some
patients with Crohn’s disease, granulomatous inﬂammation
of the pancreas seems to develop. Furthermore, antipancreatic
antibodies have been described in up to 30% of patients with
Crohn’s disease. Several cases of inﬂammatory bowel disease
have been described in association with autoimmune pancreatitis, but the mechanism for a putative association is unclear.
Thromboembolism is more common in patients with
inﬂammatory bowel disease than in the general population,
probably because of various factors. Activation of the inﬂammatory cascade in inﬂammatory bowel disease appears to
result in secondary activation of important mediators of
thrombosis, such as platelets, ﬁbrinogen, and ﬁbrinopeptide
A. A single genetic mutation does not appear to be responsible, but cases of factor V Leiden mutation, protein C deﬁciency, and protein S deﬁciency have been described in patients
with inﬂammatory bowel disease. Initially, the risk of thromboembolism was tied to the activity of inﬂammatory bowel
disease, but there are numerous reports of thromboembolic
activity in the absence of active bowel disease.

Colorectal Cancer

Patients with ulcerative colitis, and likely Crohn’s colitis, are at
increased risk for colorectal cancer, and this remains an
important cause of mortality for patients with inﬂammatory
bowel disease. In most population-based studies of ulcerative
colitis, the relative risk of colorectal cancer is two to eight
times higher than that of the general population. Overall, the
absolute risk, or cumulative incidence, of colorectal cancer is
8% to 18% after 20 to 30 years of ulcerative colitis. However,
when the risk is stratiﬁed by the extent of disease, it is clear
that more extensive disease confers a higher risk of colorectal
cancer (Table 16.6). The cumulative incidence of colorectal
cancer among patients with extensive ulcerative colitis (ie,
extent of disease proximal to the splenic ﬂexure) ranges from
6% to 50% after 30 years of disease. Another major risk factor
appears to be duration of ulcerative colitis. The cumulative
risk of colorectal cancer does not seem to be higher than that

for the general population until 8 to 10 years after diagnosis,
and the increase in risk is 0.5% to 1% each year thereafter.
Whether age at onset of colitis is a risk factor independent of
disease duration is unclear.
Another important risk factor for colorectal cancer in
inﬂammatory bowel disease appears to be the presence of primary sclerosing cholangitis. Whether primary sclerosing cholangitis is a truly independent risk factor for colorectal cancer
or whether it functions as a marker for long-standing but
asymptomatic pancolitis is not clear. Also, a family history of
colorectal cancer in a patient with inﬂammatory bowel disease
appears to be a risk factor for cancer independent of the aforementioned factors. In several reports, endoscopically and histologically conﬁrmed inﬂammation have been implicated as a
risk factor for colorectal dysplasia and cancer.
In many studies, prolonged treatment with 5-aminosalicylates or sulfasalazine appears to decrease the risk of colorectal
cancer substantially. Conversely, in the period when nonsulfonamide 5-aminosalicylate agents were not available commercially, the presence of sulfonamide allergy appeared to be
a risk factor for colorectal cancer. However, the data are
conﬂicting on this point, in that some studies have not found
a risk reduction for patients receiving treatment with
5-aminosalicylates. Several studies also have suggested that the
use of ursodeoxycholic acid is associated with a lower risk of
colorectal neoplasia among patients with primary sclerosing
cholangitis who have inﬂammatory bowel disease.
Dysplasia frequently precedes or is associated with inﬂammatory bowel disease-related colorectal cancer. The dysplastic
change may be ﬂat or polypoid on endoscopy. In an attempt
to manage the increased risk of colorectal cancer, surveillance
colonoscopy with biopsy at regular intervals is offered to many
patients with long-standing and extensive ulcerative colitis.
Although surveillance colonoscopy has never been proved to
decrease colorectal cancer-related mortality of patients with
inﬂammatory bowel disease, several retrospective studies have
suggested this to be the case. Surveillance is thought to detect
early, curable cancers and to identify patients at increased risk
for the development of cancer. The use of staining dyes in
combination with high-magniﬁcation lenses (also known as
chromoendoscopy) may increase substantially the ability of
the endoscopist to detect dysplastic lesions. This technique is
actively being studied.

We recommend institution of regular surveillance colonoscopy with biopsy after 8 to 10 years of left-sided or extensive
colitis in both ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease. This procedure should be performed at least every other year, and
some experts advocate yearly procedures. Patients who have
only proctitis do not have an increased risk of colorectal cancer
and do not require surveillance colonoscopy. Patients with
primary sclerosing cholangitis should begin surveillance
colonoscopy immediately. Random biopsy specimens should
be obtained in a consistent fashion (“the more biopsies, the
better”). Some experts advocate four-quadrant biopsies every
10 to 15 cm, which results in approximately 40 biopsy specimens. At Mayo Clinic, we obtain a minimum of 32 biopsy
specimens (four each from the cecum, ascending, proximal
transverse, distal transverse, proximal descending, distal
descending, and sigmoid colon and rectum). These are placed
in four bottles (eight per bottle). In addition to the 32 random
samples, specimens are obtained from suspicious lesions or
nodules and placed in separate bottles.
Most investigators agree that patients with ﬂat, high-grade
dysplasia are at particularly high risk for either synchronous
cancer or metachronous cancer in the near future. Immediate
colectomy is recommended. However, debate continues about
whether patients with ﬂat, low-grade dysplasia should be
offered immediate colectomy or more intensive surveillance
colonoscopy. In the past, we had recommended immediate
colectomy because most retrospective studies had suggested
that the 5-year risk for progression to high-grade dysplasia,
polypoid dysplasia, or cancer after a diagnosis of low-grade
dysplasia may be as high as 50%. However, if the low-grade
dysplasia is unifocal, we will offer, in selected cases, more frequent enhanced surveillance techniques such as chromoendoscopy or colonoscopy associated with narrow-band imaging
and autoﬂuorescence. The management of polypoid dysplasia
(formerly known as dysplasia-associated lesion or mass) also
is evolving. Previous dogma suggested that all such lesions
were an indication for immediate colectomy. However, recent
studies have suggested that if these lesions are not associated
with ﬂat dysplasia in the surrounding mucosa, they can
be removed safely with colonoscopic polypectomy and then
followed up closely.

Other Cancers

Patients with ulcerative colitis are at increased risk for cholangiocarcinoma, likely because of the increased risk of primary
sclerosing cholangitis in the population with ulcerative colitis.
(Primary sclerosing cholangitis is a risk factor for cholangiocarcinoma.) Patients who have Crohn’s disease with smallbowel involvement seem to be at increased risk for small-bowel
adenocarcinoma compared with the general population.
However, the absolute risk is low, and surveillance for this
lesion is not recommended. Whether inﬂammatory bowel
disease is a risk factor for lymphoma is a matter of controversy. Population-based studies generally have shown either

16 Inﬂammatory Bowel Disease: Extraintestinal Manifestations and Cancer

no or a slightly increased relative risk, although the latter
has been suggested by several referral center-based studies.
The question has become more complicated with widespread
use of immunosuppressive agents such as azathioprine,
6-mercaptopurine, methotrexate, and inﬂiximab. It is well
recognized that immunosuppressed states, such as posttransplantation state and acquired immunodeﬁciency syndrome,
are associated with an increased risk of lymphoproliferative
disorders. Although most individual studies of patients with
inﬂammatory bowel disease who have received immunosuppressive agents have not shown an increased risk of lymphoma,
a meta-analysis of lymphoma risk among patients with inﬂammatory bowel disease being treated with 6-mercaptopurine or
azathioprine suggested a threefold increase in lymphoma risk.
Subsequently, a meta-analysis of lymphoma risk in the setting
of anti-TNF therapy suggested a threefold increase in risk
compared with expected and an absolute annual risk of 0.06%.
It is important to emphasize that the absolute risk of lymphoma is small, and, in most situations, the beneﬁts of the
drug outweigh this potential risk.

Gastrointestinal Infections,
Clostridium difﬁcile-Associated Disease,
and Diverticular Diseasea
Conor G. Loftus, MD

Infections are a common cause of gastrointestinal disease.
This chapter focuses on the more common infectious causes
of diarrhea, food poisoning, and diverticulitis. It does not
review Helicobacter pylori infection, bacterial overgrowth, or
infections in patients seropositive for human immunodeﬁciency virus (HIV), because they are considered in other
chapters.a
Worldwide, an estimated 1 billion cases of infectious diarrhea occur annually, and the death rates are second only to
those of cardiovascular disease. It is estimated that every 10
seconds worldwide infectious diarrhea causes the death of one
child younger than 5 years. Thus, in some areas, diarrheal diseases are responsible for more years of life lost than all other
causes combined. Infectious diarrhea is more common in children and in developing countries than in adults in developed
countries. In developed countries, the infections are usually

The clinical features of infectious diarrhea vary, depending on
whether the organism is invasive and whether the infection
occurs in the small bowel or colon (Table 17.2).

Viruses

In the United States, most cases of gastroenteritis are viral and
usually are brief and self-limited (Table 17.3). Viral gastroenteritis usually is characterized by diarrhea of brief duration,
often with nausea and vomiting, and by the absence of high
fever, severe abdominal pain, and bloody diarrhea. Therapy is
symptomatic with antiemetics, antipyretics, and attention to
adequate hydration.
Rotavirus

Rotavirus is the most common cause of diarrhea in young
children worldwide. Adult infection often occurs after contact
with a sick child or as part of an institutional epidemic. In
tropical climates, rotavirus infection occurs year-round; in

temperate climates, it is more common in the winter. Spread
is by the fecal-oral route, facilitated by prolonged survival in
the environment and resistance to many disinfectants.
Symptoms occur within 72 hours after exposure, last up to
5 days, and include mild fever, diarrhea, and vomiting. Most
adults are mildly symptomatic or asymptomatic, but the disease can be severe in persons who are immunocompromised,
malnourished, or chronically ill. Death can occur from dehydration and acidosis, usually in the very young or elderly.
Symptoms may be prolonged because of transient disaccharidase deﬁciency caused by damage to small-bowel epithelial
cells, with a resultant decrease in brush border enzymes.
Treatment focuses on dehydration. Oral rehydration is optimal because oral nutrition stimulates mucosal repair, leading
to shorter duration and less severe diarrhea. Protective immunity may not develop after natural infections, although reinfection tends to be less severe. A rotavirus vaccine has been
developed and approved for use in infants. In the United
States, rotavirus vaccination is now part of the recommended
immunization schedule for children up to 6 years old.
Caliciviruses

Caliciviruses, also known as small round-structured viruses,
are the most important cause of viral gastroenteritis in adults,
and they cause many outbreaks in young children and adults.
The most common calicivirus is Norovirus (also known as
Norwalk-like virus). Outbreaks are associated with contaminated food (eg, shellﬁsh), water, or person-to-person spread.
Caliciviruses are common in the environment and are resistant to disinfectants and chlorination. The incubation period
is less than 48 hours, followed by illness lasting up to 3 days.
Infection occurs in the proximal small bowel. Diarrhea,
nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, fever, headache, and malaise are common but typically mild. Postinfectious immunity
is not permanent or fully protective against reinfection.
Astrovirus

Astrovirus is an important cause of diarrhea in infants and children, particularly in developing countries. Nausea and vomiting
are less commonly reported than with rotavirus. The incubation
period is 2 to 4 days. Illness is mild and lasts up to 5 days.
Enteric Adenovirus

Most adenoviruses cause respiratory infection, although some
strains cause diarrhea. Respiratory symptoms may precede
gastrointestinal manifestations. A long incubation period (up
to 10 days) and diarrhea of long duration (1–2 weeks) are
characteristic.
Bacteria

Bacteria are relatively uncommon causes of acute diarrhea,
and the indiscriminate culturing of stool from patients with

acute diarrhea produces few positive ﬁndings, with an unacceptably high cost per positive culture. However, stool cultures are appropriate for patients who have bloody diarrhea,
high fever or pain, fecal leukocytes, immunocompromise, or
diarrhea persisting longer than a few days. In most laboratories, routine stool cultures detect Salmonella, Shigella, and
Campylobacter. Escherichia coli O157:H7, Yersinia, Vibrio, and
others often require a special request.
Many bacterial causes of diarrhea do not require antibiotic
therapy in healthy adults. However, in those with bloody stools
or high fever or those with a chronic illness, including immunocompromise, empiric antibiotic therapy is often provided
while the results of stool culture are pending. Quinolones are
usually given for empiric coverage in adults. The more common
causes of bacterial diarrhea are summarized in Table 17.4.

patients, antibiotic therapy is unnecessary. Antibiotics are recommended for prolonged (>1 week) or worsening symptoms,
dysentery, high fever, bacteremia, pregnant women, and persons at risk for complications (extremes of age, immunocompromise, or cirrhosis). Quinolones and erythromycin are
effective therapy. Erythromycin is less expensive, with less
resistance, but treatment must be started early (within the ﬁrst
3 days of symptoms). Treatment with quinolones can be
started later in the illness, but high rates of resistance have
been reported.
Salmonella

Infection with Salmonella causes a spectrum of diseases
ranging from gastroenteritis to typhoid fever (Table 17.5).
Infection can be complicated by bacteremia resulting in

Campylobacter

Campylobacter is the most commonly identiﬁed bacterial
cause of diarrhea in the United States and is twice as common
as Salmonella and sevenfold more common than Shigella.
Most infections are due to Campylobacter jejuni and typically
are acquired from contaminated poultry (up to 90% of chickens may be colonized) or unpasteurized milk in the summer
or early autumn. Infection is most common in very young
children, teens, and young adults.
Fevers, myalgias, malaise, abdominal pain, and headache
follow an incubation period of 1 to 4 days. Diarrhea begins
later and ranges from profuse watery to bloody, lasting up to
1 week. Prolonged carriage can occur for several months, and
recurrent infection can occur in up to 25% of patients. A
chronic carrier state is rare. Hemolytic uremic syndrome
(HUS), reactive arthritis (HLA-B27), and Guillain-Barré syndrome can occur.
In most healthy patients, symptoms are mild to moderate,
and by the time the slow-growing Campylobacter is identiﬁed,
the patient’s condition has begun to improve. For these

disseminated infection. Salmonella typhi and Salmonella paratyphi cause typhoid fever. The other serotypes (∼2,000
described) cause nontyphoidal salmonellosis. Salmonella
enteritidis and Salmonella typhimurium are the two most commonly isolated serotypes in the United States.
Outbreaks typically occur in the summer or autumn and
are associated with contaminated food (undercooked or raw
poultry or eggs, meat, or dairy products), reﬂecting the high
colonization rates of Salmonella in poultry and livestock. Pets,
including turtles, reptiles, cats, and dogs, can carry and transmit the organism. Person-to-person spread is also important
in outbreaks and in developing countries. Because typhoidal
Salmonella exists only in humans, a new case of typhoid fever
indicates exposure to a carrier. Attack rates are highest among
infants, the elderly, and persons with decreased stomach acid.
Conditions that predispose to Salmonella infection, in addition to eating raw or undercooked eggs and poultry, are listed
in Table 17.6.
Gastroenteritis occurs in 75% of infections and typically
begins within 48 hours after exposure, with nausea and vomiting, followed by diarrhea and cramps. Diarrhea may range
from mild to severe and from watery to bloody. Fever and
abdominal pain are common. Localized tenderness can simulate an acute abdomen and is often localized to the right lower
quadrant, reﬂecting the ileal location of most infections.
Gastroenteritis usually lasts for 7 or fewer days, although in
unusual cases, primarily with colitis, symptoms can last for
weeks. Bacteremia occurs in 5% to 10% of infections, often
resulting in distant infections (eg, central nervous system
infections, endocarditis, or osteomyelitis). Recurrent or persistent bacteremia can occur in patients with acquired immunodeﬁciency syndrome (AIDS).

Typhoid fever (enteric fever) is a systemic infection characterized by an incubation period of 1 to 2 weeks, followed by
systemic symptoms that include fever, malaise, arthralgia,
myalgia, headache, and delirium. Gastrointestinal symptoms
are often delayed and include abdominal pain and constipation more than diarrhea. Delayed bowel perforation and
bleeding can occur. Physical ﬁndings include relative bradycardia (pulse-temperature dissociation), hepatosplenomegaly,
lymphadenopathy, and a macular rash (rose spots). Typhoid
fever is associated with recurrent or sustained bacteremia,
which results in metastatic infections. Symptoms typically last
4 weeks, although antibiotic therapy can hasten recovery.
Recurrent infection, occurring 7 to 10 days after apparent
recovery, is not uncommon. The incidence of typhoid fever is
decreasing in the United States.
Prolonged asymptomatic fecal shedding of Salmonella is
common (average, ∼5 weeks), although most patients clear
the organism within 3 months. Chronic carriage (>1 year)
occurs in less than 1% of patients with gastroenteritis and in
up to 3% with typhoid fever. Risk factors include extremes of
age and cholelithiasis (associated with chronic gallbladder
infection).
Therapy for uncomplicated gastroenteritis includes hydration and avoidance of antimotility agents. Antibiotics may
prolong the carrier state and select resistant organisms; they
do not improve outcomes and are not indicated for healthy
subjects with uncomplicated gastroenteritis. Antibiotics (eg,
quinolones, amoxicillin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole
[TMP-SMX]) are indicated for colitis, for patients with or at
risk for bacteremia (extremes of age, immunocompromise
[HIV, medications, or malignancy], valvular heart disease,
hemoglobinopathy, or orthopedic implants), for severe disease, or for chronic carriers. Multidrug resistance is becoming
a problem; therapy should be guided by sensitivity testing.
Prolonged therapy is necessary for metastatic infections.
For typhoid fever, therapy is recommended. Typically,
quinolones or third-generation cephalosporins are given as
empiric therapy while sensitivity data are pending. In cases of
ﬂuoroquinolone resistance, azithromycin is the treatment of
choice. Resistance to chloramphenicol, TMP-SMX, and ampicillin makes these drugs inappropriate for empiric therapy.
Corticosteroids also may be beneﬁcial for patients with severe
disease. In chronic carriers, therapy with a quinolone (eg,
norﬂoxacin, 400 mg twice daily for 4 weeks) may lead to clearance. If not, cholecystectomy may be needed to remove the
nidus of chronic infection.
Shigella

Shigella has 40 serotypes in four species (Shigella dysenteriae,
Shigella ﬂexneri, Shigella boydii, and Shigella sonnei). Spread is
typically person-to-person, facilitated by a low infective
dose because of resistance to stomach acid. Outbreaks are
related to contaminated food and water. S sonnei produces the
mildest disease and is the most common type in the United
States. Symptoms characteristically begin within 48 hours

17 Gastrointestinal Infections, Clostridium difﬁcile-Associated Disease, and Diverticular Disease

after ingestion and include fever, malaise, abdominal pain,
and watery diarrhea. Rectal pain or burning can be prominent. Respiratory symptoms are common, and children may
have neurologic manifestations, including seizures. The diarrhea may decrease and become bloody with mucus and pus
(ie, dysentery). This classic progression occurs in a small proportion of cases and is least common for S sonnei infections.
The initial watery diarrhea is thought to be due to the Shiga
toxin, whereas dysentery is due to mucosal invasion, which
occurs primarily in the colon. Bacteremia is uncommon.
Predictors of severity include extremes of age, malnutrition,
immunocompromise, and infection with S dysenteriae.
S dysenteriae is most likely to cause complications such as HUS
(see below), dysentery, and toxic megacolon. Shigellosis typically lasts for 1 to 3 days in children and 5 to 7 days in adults.
Although chronic carriage is unusual, prolonged infections
can occur and be difﬁcult to differentiate from ulcerative colitis. A delayed asymmetric large-joint arthritis can occur, usually in those with HLA-B27.
Treatment focuses on hydration and perhaps avoidance
of antimotility agents. Healthy patients whose condition
improves spontaneously may not require therapy. However,
antibiotics have been shown to decrease the duration of
disease and mortality. Therefore, for most patients, particularly those with chronic illnesses (including malnutrition and
HIV), the elderly, day care or health care workers, or food
handlers, antibiotic therapy is indicated. Ciproﬂoxacin is the
treatment of choice (500 mg twice daily for 5 days), with TMPSMX or azithromycin as alternative regimens. Resistance to
multiple antibiotics has been reported (amoxicillin, ampicillin), and if therapy is begun before sensitivity data are available, quinolones are recommended (for adults). For all
patients, handwashing and other hygienic practices are necessary to decrease person-to-person spread and to limit outbreaks.
Escherichia coli
Enterohemorrhagic E coli (eg, E coli O157:H7)

Enterohemorrhagic E coli (EHEC) produces Shiga toxin and
causes colitis after an incubation period of 3 to 5 days. E coli
O157:H7 accounts for more than 90% of EHEC cases in the
United States; 100 other serotypes have been identiﬁed.
Although several outbreaks have attracted considerable media
attention, most cases of EHEC are sporadic. It has been estimated that 50% of cattle and 90% of hamburger lots are contaminated with EHEC. Thus, EHEC is associated with the
ingestion of undercooked hamburger but also of salami,
sprouts, and unpasteurized milk or juice. Although the infectious dose is low, EHEC is effectively killed at temperatures
higher than 156°F. A pink center in a hamburger is associated
with lower temperatures and an increased risk of infection.
Irradiation of hamburger also effectively kills EHEC, but
whether the public will embrace irradiated foods is not
known.

197

EHEC typically produces watery diarrhea that progresses
to bloody diarrhea after a few hours to a few days. One study
suggested that EHEC is the most common cause of bloody
diarrhea in the United States. Systemic symptoms (fatigue,
myalgias, and headache), severe abdominal pain, nausea, and
vomiting are common, but fever is not. Illness typically lasts
5 to 10 days. In the elderly, EHEC may be misdiagnosed as
ischemic colitis.
EHEC can lead to HUS/thrombotic thrombocytopenic
purpura (TTP) in 5% of patients, resulting in hemolytic
anemia and renal failure, with or without central nervous
system symptoms. The pathophysiologic mechanism of
EHEC appears to be vascular endothelial damage that leads to
platelet aggregation and initiation of the coagulation cascade.
This, in turn, leads to ischemia of the colon and results in
hemorrhagic colitis. In fact, some cases of “ischemic colitis”
probably represent misdiagnosed cases of EHEC. Similar
thrombi and ischemia in the kidney may be the cause of
renal insufﬁciency in HUS. HUS/TTP can have high morbidity and mortality rates, particularly among the very young and
very old.
In some laboratories, speciﬁc testing for E coli O157:H7
(sorbitol-MacConkey agar or a newer stool toxin assay that
may be more sensitive) must be requested; thus, the condition
can be underdiagnosed. In several large series reported from
North America, E coli O157:H7 was the second to fourth most
commonly identiﬁed bacterium in acute diarrheal illnesses.
Antibiotics do not appear to be beneﬁcial and may increase
toxin production or release (or both). This, in turn, may
increase the risk of HUS/TTP and, perhaps, death. Also,
antimotility agents, including narcotics, may increase the risk
of HUS. Thus, antibiotics and antimotility agents should be
avoided if EHEC infection is suspected clinically (eg, absence
of fever in a patient with bloody diarrhea of suspected infectious origin).
Patients with EHEC should be placed in contact isolation,
and any personal contacts who have gastrointestinal symptoms should be tested for EHEC. It has been recommended
that children, food handlers, and health care workers delay
their return to school or work until they are asymptomatic
and have had several stool cultures negative for EHEC.
Enterotoxigenic E coli

Enterotoxigenic E coli (ETEC) is a common cause of diarrhea
in travelers and in children in developing countries. The
organism attaches to the small bowel and causes diarrhea
through enterotoxins. The disease ranges from mild to severe
watery diarrhea often associated with mild upper gastrointestinal tract symptoms that last for 2 to 5 days. Rehydration is
the mainstay of therapy. Antibiotics (quinolones, TMP-SMX,
and rifaximin) often are given empirically for moderate-tosevere traveler’s diarrhea. As for most gastrointestinal infections, multiple-drug antibiotic resistance has been reported
with ETEC, although resistance to quinolones does not yet
appear to be a major problem.

Section V Colon

Enteropathogenic E coli

Enteropathogenic E coli (EPEC) is primarily a problem in
infants. It caused several epidemics with high mortality in
neonatal nurseries in the early 1970s. Currently, it occurs most
often in developing countries. EPEC attaches to the smallbowel mucosa and causes watery mucoid diarrhea by producing structural changes in the microvilli. Antibiotics are effective
therapy, although resistance to TMP-SMX is emerging.
Enteroinvasive E coli

Enteroinvasive E coli (EIEC) is a rare cause of diarrhea associated with fever and abdominal pain. The diarrhea is usually
watery, but it can be accompanied by fever and leukocytes
(ie, dysentery). EIEC is similar to Shigella in its ability to invade
the colonic mucosa and produce a Shiga-like toxin. Resistance
to TMP-SMX is common, but not to quinolones.
Enteroaggregative E coli

Enteroaggregative E coli (EAEC) is primarily a problem in
infants in developing countries and in HIV-infected adults,
although it also can cause traveler’s diarrhea. EAEC causes
persistent diarrhea that can be watery or bloody. Testing for
EAEC requires a tissue culture adherence assay. Quinolones
are effective therapy, suggesting that empiric treatment with
these agents may be reasonable for patients with HIV who
have diarrhea and negative ﬁndings on evaluation.
The different types of E coli are summarized in Table 17.7.
Vibrio

Vibrio species are halophilic and associated with the consumption of raw or undercooked saltwater ﬁsh or shellﬁsh (oysters,
crabs, and mussels) or contamination of food with seawater.
Vibrio parahaemolyticus is a common cause of diarrhea in
the coastal United States and Japan, particularly during warm
months. Several toxins can be produced, resulting in various

clinical presentations. The incubation period is less than 1 to
2 days, and the primary symptom is watery diarrhea.
Abdominal pain, vomiting, and headaches are also common.
Uncommonly, V parahaemolyticus may cause frank dysentery
and mucosal ulceration. Illness typically lasts 2 to 5 days, and
antibiotics usually are not necessary. The role of antibiotics is
uncertain, even for patients with severe or prolonged symptoms. If antibiotics are administered, a reasonable choice is
ciproﬂoxacin or doxycycline.
Vibrio cholerae infection is not common in the United
States, although sporadic cases occur along the Gulf Coast and
in travelers returning from endemic areas (Latin America,
Africa, and Asia). The infectious dose is large, although
hypochlorhydria decreases it. Cholera toxin can cause profound dehydration from profuse diarrhea (up to 1 L/hour or
more) and vomiting. However, milder cases (and asymptomatic carriage) are possible. In severe cases, stools are described
as “rice water” because of the watery consistency with ﬂecks of
mucus. Hypotension, renal failure, and hypokalemic acidosis
occur in severe cases and, without aggressive rehydration,
often lead to death. Oral rehydration solution can be lifesaving, but severe cases usually require intravenous ﬂuids,
with attention to potassium and bicarbonate replacement.
Infection can be treated with various antibiotics, most commonly including tetracycline or doxycycline. Azithromycin,
erythromycin, or even a single dose of quinolone therapy can
be effective, although resistance patterns are emerging.
Vibrio vulniﬁcus also can cause diarrhea. The organism can
be acquired through wound contamination by infected seawater or by direct consumption, particularly in the summer
months. In immunocompromised patients or those with
chronic liver disease, systemic infection with sepsis is a risk,
with a high mortality rate. These patients should be instructed
not to eat or to handle raw seafood, particularly oysters.
Yersinia

Yersinia enterocolitica is less common in the United States
than in northern Europe. Yersinia typically is acquired in

cold months from contaminated food, milk, or water and has
an incubation period of 4 to 7 days. Many animals can harbor
the organism and be a source of infection, which occurs primarily in the terminal ileum. Symptoms range from mild
(fever, diarrhea, nausea, and cramps) to severe (reﬂecting
invasion). Uncommonly, Yersinia causes bacteremia with
sepsis or distant infection. Arthralgias and rash are more
common in adults than in children. Postinfectious arthritis
also can occur (HLA-B27).
In healthy patients, symptoms typically last 1 to 3 weeks.
Antibiotic therapy has not been shown to be of beneﬁt in
uncomplicated disease. Patients at risk for sepsis (cirrhosis,
iron overload, or immunocompromise) and those with severe
or prolonged symptoms, bacteremia, or distant infections may
beneﬁt from antibiotic therapy (tetracycline, quinolones, or
TMP-SMX with or without aminoglycosides). Yersinia ileocolitis can simulate Crohn’s disease (including extraintestinal
manifestations: aphthous ulcers, arthralgias, and erythema
nodosum), and right lower quadrant tenderness with mesenteric lymphadenitis can simulate appendicitis.

Parasites

Stool evaluation for ova and parasites is particularly helpful in
immunocompromised patients and those with an appropriate
exposure or travel history. Most parasites are shed intermittently, and a single stool evaluation is relatively insensitive. To
increase sensitivity, three or more separate stools should be
analyzed.
Giardia lamblia

Giardia lamblia, the most common parasitic infection in the
United States, is acquired by the ingestion of water or food
contaminated with cysts or by person-to-person spread (eg,
day care centers and nursing homes). Cysts can survive for
months in the environment and are resistant to chlorination.
In the United States, the peak incidence occurs in the summer
and early autumn. Excystation occurs in the small bowel,
where the trophozoites attach to and damage the mucosa.
High-risk groups are travelers to endemic areas, children in
day care, patients with immunoglobulin deﬁciencies, and
homosexual men. Symptoms, including watery diarrhea,
cramps, nausea, bloating, and ﬂatulence, occur 1 to 2 weeks
after ingestion. Patients initially may have acute disease,
although diarrhea may be intermittent, leading to a delay in
seeking medical attention. Chronic symptoms also may occur
and can be associated with malabsorption. Some persons
become asymptomatic carriers with chronic cyst passage.
Examination of multiple stools for trophozoites or cysts is
reasonably sensitive in cases of acute watery diarrhea. With
chronic symptoms or less watery stools, this examination is
insensitive and duodenal aspirate and biopsy (organisms or
lack of plasma cells) or fecal analysis for Giardia antigen may
be better. Metronidazole (250 mg 3 times daily for 5–7 days)

199

or tinidazole (single 2-g dose) are effective therapies. Other
treatments include albendazole, furazolidone, or nitazoxanide. Treatment of asymptomatic carriers provides no beneﬁt
for the individual but may help prevent outbreaks, for example, among day care or health care workers.
Cryptosporidium

Although Cryptosporidium increasingly has been recognized
as a pathogen during the AIDS epidemic, it also can cause
diarrhea in immunocompetent hosts. Infection commonly
is acquired from contaminated water or person-to-person
spread. It can resist chlorination, resulting in outbreaks even
in industrialized areas. Several US outbreaks have been attributed to contaminated water sources. Cryptosporidium invades
the small-bowel mucosa and causes inﬂammation, villous
blunting, and malabsorption. In most healthy patients, disease
is mild and self-limited, with watery diarrhea, nausea, cramps,
and ﬂatulence developing 7 to 10 days after ingestion. Stools
may be intermittent and mucoid but should not contain much
blood or pus. Diarrhea can last 6 weeks or longer. Headaches,
fevers, or myalgias are common. The diagnosis can be made by
stool analysis (immunoassays are more sensitive than microscopy) or small-bowel biopsy. In healthy patients, treatment
usually is not necessary. Cryptosporidiosis in patients with
AIDS is discussed in Chapter 10, Gastrointestinal Manifestations of Human Immunodeﬁciency Virus Infection.
Entamoeba histolytica

Amebiasis is the most common parasitic diarrhea in the world,
although it is less common in the United States. Most cases in
the United States occur in travelers or immigrants from
endemic areas (Latin America, Africa, and India) and in
homosexual men. Infection is acquired through the ingestion
of contaminated food or water. Amebic cysts undergo excystation in the small bowel and infect the colon. Symptoms begin
7 to 21 days after ingestion and include bloody diarrhea,
abdominal pain, fever, and tenesmus, consistent with invasive
colitis. Amebic colitis can vary from mild to fulminant, with
severe bleeding or perforation. Because the risk of perforation
is increased by corticosteroid use, it is important to differentiate amebic colitis from ulcerative colitis. Amebic ulcers are
caused by mucosal invasion by trophozoites. The ulcers vary
from mild to severe, with the classic description being that of
undermined edges leading to a ﬂask-shaped ulcer. Amebae
can penetrate the bowel wall, enter the portal circulation, and
cause liver or splenic abscesses. Patients with liver abscesses
tend to be male, and they may not have a discernible history of
colitis. Distant infection (peritonitis, empyema, or central
nervous system infection) also can occur. A localized infection
surrounded by granulation tissue or a dense ﬁbrous coat
(ameboma) can resemble colon cancer.
Diagnosis is made by stool examination. Three or more
samples may be needed to make the diagnosis with microscopy, although stool antigen testing and the polymerase chain

200

Section V Colon

reaction for Entamoeba histolytica DNA are more sensitive.
Metronidazole (750 mg 3 times daily for 7–10 days) is the drug
of choice for treating colitis or liver abscesses. Cysts are relatively resistant to metronidazole and require a second agent
such as diloxanide furoate, paromomycin, or iodoquinol.
Drainage of liver abscesses is not recommended unless rupture is imminent or medical therapy is ineffective.
Numerous nonpathologic amebae can inhabit the human
colon, including Entamoeba coli, Entamoeba hartmanni, and
Endolimax nana. Distinguishing between these organisms and
Entamoeba histolytica can be difﬁcult with routine microscopy, even for experienced examiners, although serologic testing and stool polymerase chain reaction assay should help.

Table 17.8
Antimicrobial Options for Traveler’s Diarrhea

Blastocystis hominis

From 1988 to 1992 in the United States, 2,423 food-borne
outbreaks affected more than 77,000 people. Because of underreporting, the true burden of disease may be 10 to 100 times
higher. Most cases of bacterial diarrhea, as indicated in Table
17.4, are acquired from food and can be considered forms of
“food poisoning.” Also, some bacteria cause acute gastrointestinal symptoms from preformed toxins that are ingested with
contaminated foods. Common symptoms of food poisoning
and typical offending agents are listed in Table 17.9.
Staphylococcus aureus toxin causes 1 to 2 days of severe
vomiting, cramps, and diarrhea that begin 2 to 6 hours after
ingestion (eg, cream-ﬁlled pastries, meat, or potato or egg
salad). Severe infection can cause dehydration.
Clostridium perfringens toxin produces 1 to 2 days of
abdominal pain and watery diarrhea that usually begin 8 to
24 hours after ingestion of foods typically prepared in advance
and left to sit unrefrigerated (eg, beef, poultry, or gravy). An
uncommon strain of C perfringens produces the potentially
fatal enteritis necroticans, or pigbel, a condition that occurs
primarily in poor tropical regions.
Bacillus cereus toxin causes nausea and vomiting that usually occur within 2 to 6 hours after ingestion (eg, pork, creams
or sauces, or fried rice) and last 6 to 10 hours. Diarrhea may

Blastocystis hominis is found occasionally on routine stool
examinations for ova and parasites. Its pathogenicity is uncertain, particularly in immunocompetent hosts. However, if no
other cause for a patient’s symptoms is found, a trial of metronidazole can be considered.

Traveler’s Diarrhea

Infectious diarrhea affects 40% to 60% of travelers to high-risk
areas of Southeast Asia, the Middle East, India, Africa, and
Latin America. The incidence of diarrhea varies depending on
the speciﬁc area visited (eg, urban or rural), the traveler’s
age, time of year, and local conditions such as ﬂooding or
a cholera outbreak. Bacteria cause 80% to 90% of cases of
traveler’s diarrhea, and the other 10% to 20% are due to
parasites, viruses, or toxins. ETEC is a common cause. The
unusual case of prolonged traveler’s diarrhea is more likely to
be caused by a parasite such as Giardia lamblia or Cyclospora
cayetanensis. The risk of infection can be decreased by avoiding uncooked foods, local water (including ice), and unpasteurized drinks.
Symptoms typically begin several days after the person
arrives in the area and last for 3 to 5 days. Watery diarrhea,
bloating, fatigue, and cramps are common. Bloody diarrhea
and high fever are uncommon; their presence suggests an
invasive organism and should prompt an evaluation for a speciﬁc organism. For most travelers, antibiotic prophylaxis is
not recommended. However, patients with immunocompromise, severe chronic illness, hypochlorhydria, or proton pump
inhibitor therapy may beneﬁt from prophylaxis (eg, ciproﬂoxacin, 500 mg daily). Bismuth subsalicylate (2 tablets 4 times
daily) is alternative prophylaxis.
Mild cases of traveler’s diarrhea can be treated with rehydration and antidiarrheals or bismuth (if no fever, severe pain,
or bloody diarrhea) for 1 to 3 days (Table 17.8). For moderateto-severe diarrhea, a quinolone is recommended, often
together with an antidiarrheal. Ampicillin and TMP-SMX are
not recommended because of the high rates of resistance in
some areas.

occur later, probably from a toxin formed in vivo. In healthy
hosts, antibiotic therapy is not necessary for these acute forms
of food poisoning due to preformed enterotoxins.
Listeria monocytogenes can be found in many foods (eg, hot
dogs, lunch meat, and cheeses), and its growth is not substantially inhibited by refrigeration. It can cause gastroenteritis,
often with fever, that is typically mild and self-limited, lasting
1 to 2 days. However, in chronically ill or immunosuppressed
patients and in the very young, the elderly, and pregnant
women, Listeria also can cause severe disease, with bacteremia
and disseminated infection associated with a high mortality
rate. Therapy, usually with ampicillin and gentamicin, is
indicated.

Clostridium difﬁcile-Associated Disease
Background

The ﬁrst case of pseudomembranous colitis was reported in
1893 as “diphtheritic colitis,” and the Clostridium difﬁcile
organism was described in 1935. It was not until the 1970s that
C difﬁcile was implicated as a causative factor in pseudomembranous colitis. Although C difﬁcile-associated disease was
described before antibiotics were introduced, most current
cases are associated with antibiotic use. Other conditions that
can predispose to C difﬁcile-associated disease include bowel
ischemia, surgery, malnutrition, chemotherapy, and critical illness. The spectrum of disease associated with C difﬁcile includes
an asymptomatic carrier state, diarrhea without colitis, and
various degrees of colitis with or without pseudomembranes.
Recent increases in the rates of C difﬁcile infections may be
associated with increased use of antibiotics in the community.
Epidemiology

During the past 25 years, there has been an increase in the
occurrence rate and a more modest clinical spectrum of
C difﬁcile-associated disease, trends thought to be due to
increased use of antibiotics, more aggressive testing, and early
intervention. Recent data reﬂect the health care burden of
C difﬁcile infection: an additional hospital cost of more than
$3,000 per patient and an extra length of stay of 3.6 days,
leading to an estimated cost in the United States in excess of
$1 billion per year.
C difﬁcile is detected in very few (1%–3%) healthy adults. It
is more common in hospitalized adults and in patients receiving antibiotic therapy. Up to 50% of infants and children carry
the bacterium, but pseudomembranous colitis is rare in this
age group. The incidence of antibiotic-associated diarrhea
varies from 5% to 39%, depending on the antibiotic used, and
most cases are due to the antibiotic and not to infection with
C difﬁcile, particularly in outpatients. Pseudomembranous
colitis occurs in only 10% of cases of antibiotic-associated
diarrhea. In contrast to antibiotic-associated diarrhea, most
cases of pseudomembranous colitis are due to C difﬁcile.

201

Risk factors for C difﬁcile-associated disease include older
age (>70 years), uremia, burns, abdominal surgery, cancer,
inﬂammatory bowel disease, use of gastric acid suppressive
medication, and being in an intensive care unit. It is not known
whether these groups are more exposed to nosocomial infections or are more susceptible to C difﬁcile-associated disease
because of their speciﬁc illnesses.
Case Presentation

A 75-year-old man sought care for a 2-day history of crampy
lower abdominal pain, nonbloody diarrhea, tenesmus, and
fever. He recently completed a course of antibiotic therapy for
pneumonia. On physical examination, he appeared ill, with a
temperature of 101°F, normal blood pressure, and a pulse rate
of 98 beats/minute. The abdomen was mildly distended and
tender without guarding or rebound. Laboratory studies
showed leukocytosis of 13.4×10 9 cells/L, with 15% band forms.
Stool analysis showed many leukocytes, and C difﬁcile toxin was
detected. Abdominal radiography showed mild ileus but no
dilatation of the colon. Treatment with metronidazole, 500 mg
3 times daily by mouth, promptly improved the symptoms.
Clinical Presentation

The time between starting antibiotic therapy and the appearance of clinical symptoms varies from 1 day to 6 weeks, most
commonly 3 to 9 days. However, symptoms may occur after a
single dose of antibiotics (including topical antibiotics) or
they may not begin until several weeks after antibiotic therapy
has been discontinued.
Presentation may range from only loose stools to toxic
megacolon (nausea, vomiting, high-grade fever, and ileus)
and colonic perforation. Typically, the disease manifests with
watery or mucoid diarrhea, abdominal pain, and low-grade
fever. Stools may contain small amounts of blood.
Extraintestinal manifestations, such as arthritis, are rare.
Diarrhea may cause dehydration and electrolyte depletion.
Overall mortality rate is low (2%–3%), although it is higher
among the elderly or debilitated patients (10%–20%) and with
fulminant colitis or toxic megacolon (30%–80%). In some
patients (5%–19%), disease is localized to the proximal colon
and may manifest with an acute abdomen and localized
rebound tenderness, but no diarrhea, and normal ﬁndings on
sigmoidoscopy.
Despite successful treatment, 10% to 25% of patients have
disease relapse, regardless of the therapeutic agent used.
Disease relapse usually responds well to re-treatment with
metronidazole or vancomycin, but the risk of additional recurrences is high.
Differential Diagnosis

Staphylococcal enterocolitis and typhlitis can occur in patients
receiving chemotherapy and can have a presentation similar
to that of C difﬁcile-associated disease. Exacerbation of Crohn’s

202

Section V Colon

disease and ulcerative colitis can simulate C difﬁcile-associated
disease, and, importantly, C difﬁcile infection can cause a
symptom ﬂare in patients with inﬂammatory bowel disease.
Other disorders in the differential diagnosis include chemical
colitis (chemotherapy or gold), ischemic colitis, and other
infections (Campylobacter, Salmonella, Shigella, E coli,
Entamoeba, Listeria, cytomegalovirus).
Pathophysiology

The development of C difﬁcile-associated disease requires an
alteration in the normal gut ﬂora or mucosal immunity, the
acquisition and germination of spores, overgrowth of C difﬁcile, and the production of toxin. Toxin A binds to mucosal
receptors and causes cytotoxicity by disrupting cytoplasmic
microﬁlaments and inducing apoptosis. Toxin B can then
enter the damaged mucosa and cause further cytotoxicity,
resulting in hemorrhage, inﬂammation, and cellular necrosis.
The toxins also interfere with protein synthesis, stimulate
granulocyte chemotaxis, increase capillary permeability, and
promote peristalsis. In severe cases, inﬂammation and necrosis may involve deeper layers of the colon and result in toxic
dilatation or perforation.
A new hypervirulent strain of C difﬁcile (NAP1/BI/027) has
been linked with selected outbreaks of severe disease in recent
years. An epidemic strain of NAP1/BI/027 is known to produce a binary toxin not produced by other C difﬁcile strains.
The epidemic strain also produces larger quantities of toxin
A/B in vitro and is resistant to ﬂuoroquinolones in vitro.
Diagnostic Testing

Diagnosis is based on a combination of clinical ﬁndings, laboratory test results, and occasionally endoscopy. Leukocytosis
and hypoalbuminemia are not uncommon. Fecal leukocytes
can be seen, but their absence does not exclude colitis. Stool
culture for C difﬁcile is relatively demanding and has low predictive value.
Cytotoxicity assays are considered positive when cultured
cells show cytopathic changes on exposure to stool ﬁltrates.
The result is then conﬁrmed by neutralizing these effects with
speciﬁc antitoxins. This is considered the standard diagnostic
method because of its high sensitivity and speciﬁcity. However,
cytotoxicity assays are expensive and time consuming.
Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the
detection of toxin A or B is less expensive and faster than tissue
culture and, thus, is preferred at many centers. Sensitivity is
lower (75%–85%) than for cytotoxic assays, but performing
the test on two or three separate stools should increase sensitivity to 90% to 95%. In addition, proper storage and handling
may prevent toxin degradation and improve sensitivity. A
newer ELISA to detect the presence of either toxin (TOX A/B
test) has excellent speciﬁcity and improved sensitivity compared with testing for either toxin alone, because some strains
of C difﬁcile may produce only one toxin or the other. In July
2009, a polymerase chain reaction assay based on the stool

Figure 17.1 Typical histologic appearance of pseudomembranous

colitis.

toxin assay was introduced, with a sensitivity of approximately
95% using a single stool sample.
Although endoscopic ﬁndings may be normal in patients
with mild C difﬁcile-associated disease, most patients have
abnormal mucosa. Flexible sigmoidoscopy is diagnostic in
most cases, but colonoscopy may be required in about 10% of
cases when disease is localized above the splenic ﬂexure.
Endoscopy may be the fastest means of suggesting the diagnosis, but in patients with severe disease, it is hazardous and
should be avoided. Colitis may range from minimal erythema
or edema to ulceration, often with nodular exudates that may
coalesce to form yellow “pseudomembranes” consisting of
mucus and ﬁbrin ﬁlled with dead leukocytes and mucosal
cells (Fig.17.1).
Treatment of Primary Infection

For mild disease, supportive therapy alone (without antibiotic
treatment) may be sufﬁcient, including rehydration and discontinuation of treatment with the offending antibiotic.
Antidiarrheal agents and narcotics should be avoided because
they may prolong exposure to toxins and result in more severe
colitis. Speciﬁc antibiotic therapy should be prescribed if supportive therapy fails, if treatment with the offending antibiotic
cannot be discontinued, or if symptoms are severe. For severe
disease, hospitalization for antibiotic therapy and intravenous
hydration may be necessary. When C difﬁcile-associated disease is suspected in elderly and severely ill patients, empiric
antibiotic therapy should be started before test results are
known.
Metronidazole is inexpensive and effective and has response
and relapse rates comparable to those of vancomycin. The
usual oral dose is 250 to 750 mg 3 or 4 times daily for 7 to
10 days. Because of concerns about cost and resistance with
vancomycin, metronidazole is the preferred ﬁrst-line therapy.
However, metronidazole has more adverse effects and is
not recommended for children or pregnant women. If the
patient’s condition does not improve promptly (2–3 days),

17 Gastrointestinal Infections, Clostridium difﬁcile-Associated Disease, and Diverticular Disease

the situation should be reassessed and, if the diagnosis is
secure, vancomycin should be substituted for metronidazole.
Vancomycin is a reliable but more expensive treatment,
with response rates of 90% to 100%, and is the preferred treatment for severely ill patients. Because oral vancomycin is
poorly absorbed, a high stool concentration can be achieved
without systemic adverse effects. The usual dose is 125 mg
every 6 hours for 7 to 14 days. A higher dose (250–500 mg
4 times daily) can be given to severely ill patients.
Parenteral therapy is less effective than oral therapy, but
when necessary (eg, paralytic ileus), intravenous metronidazole (500–750 mg 3 or 4 times daily) is recommended, perhaps supplemented by vancomycin (500 mg 4 times daily)
through a nasogastric tube or by enema.
Anion exchange resins work by binding toxin.
Cholestyramine (4 g 4 times daily) can help decrease symptoms in mild disease, but when it has been given alone, results
have been disappointing, with variable but generally low cure
rates. Obstipation is the most common adverse effect. Because
cholestyramine binds vancomycin, they should not be given
simultaneously.
Treatment of Recurrent Infection

Recurrent disease usually responds well to re-treatment with
metronidazole or vancomycin at standard doses. For multiple
or refractory recurrences, several therapeutic options are available. One is a prolonged course of vancomycin therapy, followed by gradual tapering, for example, 125 mg 4 times daily
for 4 to 6 weeks, 125 mg twice daily for 1 week, 125 mg daily
for 1 week, and 125 mg every other day for 1 week, followed by
125 mg every 72 hours for 2 weeks. A similar prolonged, tapering course of metronidazole can be considered, although
adverse effects may increase with longer treatment. An alternative to prolonged antibiotic tapers is vancomycin 500 mg
4 times daily for 10 to 14 days, followed by rifaximin 400 mg
3 times daily for 14 days. Another option is to give antibiotic
and anion exchange resin for 5- to 7-day periods, alternating
with periods when antibiotic treatment is withheld. Also,
treatment with a combination of vancomycin and rifampin
has been successful. Other regimens aim to suppress C difﬁcile
with the use of oral Lactobacillus GG or nonpathogenic yeast
(Saccharomyces boulardii) or with enemas containing feces
from healthy subjects. However, none of these agents has been
proved superior to standard therapy.
Surgical Treatment

Surgical treatment usually is not necessary for C difﬁcileassociated disease. Diverting ileostomy or colectomy is performed for severe refractory disease or for complications such
as perforation or megacolon. Because the risk of complications increases markedly after several days of ineffective therapy, some advocate surgery for severe disease that does not
respond after 2 to 7 days of treatment.

203

Prevention

C difﬁcile spores can survive for up to 5 months in the environment, and a primary mode of infection is the hands of
hospital personnel or contaminated objects. Therefore, prevention has a crucial role in disease management and can be
facilitated by the prudent use of antibiotics, routine hand
washing, disinfection of potentially contaminated objects, and
isolation of infected patients, including the use of gloves for
patient contact.
Treatment of asymptomatic carriers is not recommended
because it may prolong the carrier state, which usually resolves
spontaneously. Restricting the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics has decreased the rate of C difﬁcile-associated disease at
some institutions.
Summary

C difﬁcile is a spore-forming toxigenic bacterium that causes
diarrhea and colitis, typically after antibiotic therapy. The
clinical presentation ranges from self-limited diarrhea to fulminant colitis and toxic megacolon. Although in most cases
the disease is mild and responds quickly to treatment, C difﬁcile colitis may be severe, especially if diagnosis and treatment
are delayed. Recurrence can be a serious problem. Prevention
is achieved best by limiting the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics and by following good hygienic techniques and universal
precautions to limit the transmission of the bacteria. A high
index of suspicion results in early diagnosis and treatment and
potentially decreases the incidence of complications.

Diverticular Disease

In Western societies, colonic diverticulosis affects 5% to 10%
of the population older than 45 years and 80% of those older
than 85 years. Uninﬂamed and nonbleeding diverticula are
asymptomatic. Approximately 20% of patients with diverticula have an episode of symptomatic diverticulitis. Diverticular
hemorrhage is the second most common cause of colonic
bleeding after vascular lesions.
Pathophysiology

Diverticulosis affects predominantly the sigmoid colon but
may involve the entire colon. High luminal pressure is believed
to cause mucosal protrusion through weak areas where the
vasa rectae penetrate the bowel wall, resulting in diverticula.
There is an association between diverticulosis and a Western
diet high in reﬁned carbohydrates and low in dietary ﬁber;
whether this represents cause and effect is unproved. If the
neck of a diverticulum is obstructed, it may distend and lead
to bacterial overgrowth and invasion, often with perforation,
which is generally walled off by the adjacent mesocolon or
appendices epiploicae.

204

Section V Colon

Classiﬁcation

Stage I diverticulitis is characterized by small conﬁned pericolonic abscesses, and stage II disease includes larger conﬁned
pericolonic collections. Stage III involves generalized suppurative peritonitis (perforated diverticulitis); because the diverticular neck is generally obstructed by a fecalith, peritoneal
contamination by feces may not occur. Stage IV indicates fecal
peritonitis.
Clinical Features

Symptoms of diverticulitis include lower abdominal pain,
fever, and altered bowel habits (typically, diarrhea). The stool
may contain trace blood, but profuse bleeding is very uncommon. Dysuria, urinary frequency, and urgency reﬂect bladder
irritation, whereas pneumaturia, fecaluria, or recurrent urinary tract infection suggests a colovesical ﬁstula. Physical ﬁndings include fever, left lower quadrant tenderness, or a mass.
Complications

Rupture of a peridiverticular abscess or uninﬂamed diverticulum causes peritonitis, occurs more commonly in the elderly
and immunosuppressed persons, and is associated with a high
mortality rate. Repeated episodes of acute diverticulitis may
lead to colonic obstruction. Jaundice or hepatic abscesses suggest pylephlebitis. A massively dilated (>10 cm) cecum, signs
of cecal necrosis (ie, air in the bowel wall), or marked tenderness mandates immediate surgical consultation. Colovesical
and, less frequently, colovaginal and colocutaneous ﬁstulas
may occur.
Diagnostic Studies

A contrast enema shows diverticula but not diverticular
inﬂammation. Moreover, contrast studies may cause perforation. If the clinical features are highly suggestive of diverticulitis, imaging studies are unnecessary. If the diagnosis is
uncertain or if an abscess is suspected, computed tomography
is preferred, although the results may be false negative in up to
20% of cases. Ultrasonography also may show diverticular
inﬂammation, but it is more operator-dependent than computed tomography and abdominal tenderness may preclude
application of sufﬁcient external pressure. Flexible sigmoidoscopy is necessary only if carcinoma or colitis is a concern.
Treatment

Treatment is inﬂuenced by severity, ability to tolerate oral
intake, previous history of diverticulitis or bleeding, and
complications.
• Mild ﬁrst attack, tolerate oral intake: Outpatient therapy
with a liquid diet and oral broad-spectrum antibiotics
(eg, ciproﬂoxacin and metronidazole). After the acute

attack has resolved, a high ﬁber diet and colonoscopy
(to exclude cancer) are advisable. Approximately 5%
to 10% of patients will have a second attack within
2 years.
• Severe pain, inability to tolerate oral intake, persistent
symptoms despite adequate outpatient therapy: Hospitalization, nothing by mouth, and broad-spectrum
intravenous antibiotics. Computed tomography to
exclude abscess or perforation. Consider computed
tomography-guided percutaneous drainage of an abscess
to control systemic sepsis, permitting a single-stage surgical procedure, if necessary, at a later stage.
• Surgery: Emergency operation is indicated for peritonitis, uncontrolled sepsis, perforation, and clinical deterioration. Indications for elective surgery include ﬁstula
formation, stricture, and recurrent diverticulitis.
If surgical treatment can be deferred until acute inﬂammation heals, then a single-stage primary resection and reanastomosis, perhaps laparoscopically, can be accomplished with
minimal morbidity and mortality. For emergency indications,
the ﬁrst stage of a two-stage procedure involves resection of
the diseased segment and creation of an end colostomy with
oversewing of the distal colonic or rectal stump (Hartmann’s
procedure). Colonic continuity may be reestablished in a
second operation.

Colorectal Neoplasms
Lisa A. Boardman, MD, and Paul J. Limburg, MD, MPH

Colorectal cancer is primarily a disease of urban, industrialized societies. In the United States, the lifetime risk for the
development of this cancer is approximately 6%. Recent data
have suggested that the incidence rates for colorectal cancer
may be decreasing gradually in some subgroups of the population. However, the mechanisms underlying these favorable
trends have not been deﬁned completely. Several national
organizations have endorsed screening and surveillance guidelines, which undoubtedly have contributed to more effective
prevention of colorectal cancer.

Clinical Featuresa
Deﬁnition

Most cases (>95%) of colorectal cancer are adenocarcinomas.
Less common cancer subtypes include lymphoma, carcinoid,
and leiomyosarcoma. Metastatic lesions to the colorectum can
include lymphoma, leiomyosarcoma, malignant melanoma,
and adenocarcinomas of the breast, ovary, prostate, lung, and
stomach. Because of the relative rarity of these other malignancies, the term colorectal cancer is used throughout the rest
of this chapter to refer to primary adenocarcinoma. The term
colorectal neoplasia is used to refer to either malignant adenocarcinomas or premalignant adenomas, as described in more
detail below.

Abbreviations: AFAP, attenuated familial adenomatous polyposis;
COX, cyclooxygenase; CT, computed tomography; FAP, familial
adenomatous polyposis; MAP, MutYH-associated polyposis;
SEER, Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results; VEGF, vascular
endothelial growth factor

Presentation

Clinical manifestations of colorectal cancer often are related
to tumor size and location. Common signs and symptoms of
proximal neoplasms (cecum to splenic ﬂexure) include illdeﬁned abdominal pain, weight loss, and occult bleeding. The
presentation of distal neoplasms (descending colon to rectum)
may be altered bowel habits, decreased stool caliber, or hematochezia (or a combination of these). Colonoscopy is the test
of choice for the diagnostic evaluation of any signs or symptoms suggestive of colorectal cancer because tissue specimens
can be obtained at the time of visual inspection. Up to 7% of
patients with colorectal cancer may have additional, synchronous malignancies in the colon or rectum at the time of the
index cancer diagnosis. At the time of the initial diagnosis of
colorectal cancer, 39% of patients have localized disease, 36%
have regional metastases, and 19% have distant metastases.
Distant metastases typically occur in the liver, peritoneal
cavity, and lung. Less common sites of metastases are the adrenal glands, ovaries, and bone. Central nervous system metastases are rare.
Adenoma-Carcinoma Sequence

Most colorectal cancers are thought to develop through an
ordered series of events: normal colonic mucosa→mucosa at
risk→adenoma→adenocarcinoma. Indirect evidence to support this adenoma-carcinoma sequence includes the following:
1) prevalence rates cosegregate within populations, 2) subsite
distribution patterns within the colorectum are similar,
3) benign adenomatous tissue is often juxtaposed with invasive cancer in early-stage malignancies, and 4) incidence rates
of colorectal cancer are decreased by endoscopic polypectomy.
Also, speciﬁc molecular alterations have been associated with
the adenoma-carcinoma sequence (Fig.18.1). The APC tumor
suppressor gene is considered the “gatekeeper” and is mutated
in approximately 85% of all colorectal cancers. K-ras is the

most frequently activated oncogene in colorectal neoplasms
and is mutated in approximately 50% of large (≥1 cm) adenomas and adenocarcinomas. The p53 gene appears to be
mutated later in carcinogenesis, because chromosomal loss is
relatively more common in malignant (70%–80%) than in
benign neoplasms. DNA mismatch repair genes, including
MSH2, MLH1, PMS1, PMS2, and MSH6, maintain nucleic
acid sequence integrity during replication and have been
termed caretaker genes. Mutations in these genes are found in
10% to 15% of sporadic colorectal cancers and are associated
with microsatellite instability.
Polyp Subtypes

Adenomatous polyps are considered to have malignant potential, whereas hyperplastic, inﬂammatory, and hamartomatous
(juvenile) polyps generally do not. Sessile serrated adenomas
confer an increased risk for future colorectal cancer and have
been implicated in being precursor lesions for microsatellite
unstable colorectal cancer. Adenomas can be classiﬁed further
as tubular (70%–85%), villous (<5%), or tubulovillous
(10%–25%) on the basis of their glandular histologic features
and as low-grade or high-grade on the basis of their degree of
dysplasia. “Advanced” adenomas are associated with an

increased risk of colorectal cancer and usually are deﬁned by
1) large size (≥1 cm), 2) any villous histologic features, or
3) high-grade dysplasia. Multiple (three or more) synchronous adenomas also are associated with an increased risk of
colorectal cancer.
Staging and Prognosis

The American Joint Commission on Cancer system is commonly used to stage colon and rectal cancers (Table 18.1). It
subcategorizes the pathologic stage of the tumor to correlate
with prognosis. This classiﬁcation system has subdivided
pathologic stages further to account for worse prognosis on
the basis of the depth of tumor invasion, number of metastatic
regional nodes, and number of metastatic sites. For colon cancers, the preoperative, or clinical, stage typically is determined
by physical examination, computed tomography (CT), and
chest radiography. For rectal cancer, endoscopic ultrasonography or pelvic magnetic resonance imaging can provide additional information about the depth of tumor invasion and
regional lymph node status. Prior to neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy, rectal cancers may be given a clinical stage designated
by a “c” after the T or N category; after neoadjuvant treatment, rectal cancers are given a pathologic stage designated by

From 1998 to 2004, the annual percentage change in colorectal cancer incidence rates was −2.5% (2.8% for men and −2.2%
for women). However, for persons 20 to 49 years old, incidence rates for colorectal cancer from 1992 to 2005 increased
1.5% per year for men and 1.6% per year for women.
Race and Ethnicity

Of the ﬁve major racial-ethnic population subgroups monitored by the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results
(SEER) program, African-Americans have the highest incidence and mortality rates for colorectal cancer, and the 5-year
survival rate is also less than that of white Americans. Although
this likely is explained, at least partly, by differences in the
stage of disease at the time of diagnosis, the survival gap persists when within-stage comparisons are made.

Anatomical subsites of the colorectum differ in their embryologic origin, physiologic function, and vascular supply.
Differences in the morphology, histology, and genetics of colorectal cancer have been observed across regions within the
large bowel. Subsite-speciﬁc incidence rates also differ, and
the proportion of cases of colorectal cancer located in the
proximal colon appears to be increasing relative to that in the
distal colon and rectum.

Host and Environmental Factors
Age

the letters “yp” preceding the TNM categories. Final colorectal
cancer stage incorporates pathology review of the resected
tumor tissue. Pathologic stage is the best predictor of survival.
The overall 5-year survival rate for colorectal cancer is approximately 64%. Stage-speciﬁc 5-year disease-free survival rates
for colon cancer are as follows: stage I, 93%; IIa, 85%; IIb,
72%; IIIa, 83%; IIIb, 64%; IIIc, 44%; and IV, 8%. Five-year
survival rates for rectal cancer are generally similar.

Epidemiology
General Distribution

Worldwide, colorectal cancer ranks fourth in cancer incidence
for men and third for women. However, the incidence rates
vary by global region (25-fold difference or more). Areas with
the highest reported incidence rates for colorectal cancer
include North America, Australia/New Zealand, Western
Europe, and Japan. Conversely, most parts of Africa and Asia
report low incidence rates. In the United States, age-adjusted
incidence and mortality rates of colorectal cancer for women
are 44.6/100,000 and 16.4/100,000, respectively, and for
men, the rates are higher at 60.8/100,000 and 23.5/100,000.

As with most malignancies, the incidence rates of colorectal
cancer increase with advancing age. Fewer than 5% of cases
occur among persons younger than 45 years. SEER data suggest that age-speciﬁc incidence rates for colorectal cancer
begin to increase more rapidly during the ﬁfth decade. The
prevalence of adenomatous polyps also increases with age,
with estimates of 30% at 50 years, 40% to 50% at 60 years, and
50% to 65% at 70 years. Also, several important clinical features of adenomas may be age-related. In the National Polyp
Study, the risk of having a polyp with high-grade dysplasia was
80% higher among subjects 60 years or older than among
younger subjects.
Personal History of Colorectal Neoplasia

Persons with a personal history of colorectal adenomas or
adenocarcinomas are at increased risk (up to sixfold) for additional, or metachronous, neoplasms. Adenoma characteristics
associated with future tumor development include large size
(≥1 cm), villous histology, and three or more lifetime colonic
adenomas. Neither hyperplastic polyps nor small, solitary
tubular adenomas are strong risk factors for metachronous
neoplasms. After resection of colorectal cancer, the annual

208

Section V Colon

incidence rate for a second primary colon or rectal cancer has
been estimated at 0.35%.
Family History of Colorectal Neoplasia

Familial clustering is observed in approximately 15% of all
cases of colorectal cancer, including patients with heritable
cancer syndromes (see below). In the absence of an identiﬁable syndrome, a strong family history of colorectal neoplasia
(typically deﬁned as having one ﬁrst-degree relative with colorectal neoplasia diagnosed before age 60 years or two or more
ﬁrst-degree relatives with colorectal neoplasia diagnosed at
any age) appears to confer approximately a 1.5- to 2-fold
increase in the risk of colorectal cancer.
Inﬂammatory Bowel Disease

Chronic ulcerative colitis is associated with a substantially
increased risk of colorectal cancer over time. Cumulative incidence rates range from 2% after 10 years to 18% after 30 years
of disease. The extent of colitis has been positively associated
with colorectal cancer risk (pancolitis > distal colitis > proctitis), but the effects of disease activity have not been deﬁned
completely. Primary sclerosing cholangitis and a family history of colorectal cancer represent additional risk factors.
However, the effects of disease activity on the risk of colorectal
cancer are not conclusively known. Fewer data are available
about the association between Crohn’s disease and colorectal
cancer, but the risk appears to be comparable to that of chronic
ulcerative colitis among patients with inﬂammatory bowel
disease of similar duration. Current data do not support an
increased risk of colorectal cancer for patients with lymphocytic or collagenous colitis. Studies have suggested that inﬂammatory bowel disease-related tumors may develop through a
molecular pathway different from that of sporadic neoplasia,
with aneuploidy occurring early in the carcinogenic process.
Dietary Components

Excess body weight has been associated with a 1.5- to 2-fold
increase in the risk of colorectal cancer, although not all observational studies have demonstrated consistent results. Red
meat, particularly when consumed with a heavily browned
surface, has been proposed as a risk factor for both benign and
malignant colorectal neoplasia.
Vegetables and fruits contain a wide array of potentially
anticarcinogenic substances that may function through one or
several independent or codependent mechanisms. Generally,
vegetable consumption has been one of the most consistent
predictors of reduced risk of colorectal cancer, but fruit consumption appears to be associated less strongly with reductions in large-bowel tumorigenesis.
Fiber enhances stool bulk, decreases the concentration of
procarcinogenic secondary bile acids, and increases the concentration of anticarcinogenic short-chain fatty acids.
Although multiple case-control studies initially suggested a

protective effect by increased dietary ﬁber, subsequent intervention trials have not observed appreciable reductions in the
risk of colorectal cancer.
Calcium binds to intraluminal toxins and also inﬂuences
mucosal proliferation within the colorectum. In one clinical
trial, calcium supplementation was associated with a statistically signiﬁcant 19% decrease in the recurrence of adenoma in
postpolypectomy patients after 4 years. However, in another
large, randomized, controlled trial of postmenopausal women,
calcium and vitamin D supplementation for 7 years had no
appreciable effect on incident colorectal cancer.
Antioxidants (including retinoids, carotenoids, ascorbic
acid, α-tocopherol, and selenium) have been hypothesized to
prevent carcinogen formation by neutralizing free radical
compounds. So far, observational and experimental data have
been unimpressive, with the exception that selenium decreased
the risk of colorectal cancer by 58% when measured as a secondary end point in a skin cancer prevention study.
Folate and methionine supply methyl groups necessary for
critical cellular functions such as nucleotide synthesis and
gene regulation. Particularly in the context of excess alcohol
consumption, dietary deﬁciencies of these compounds may be
a risk factor for colorectal cancer. Nonetheless, in a recent
multicenter clinical trial of participants with a previous history of benign colorectal neoplasia, 1 mg/day of folic acid was
found to be associated with increased risks for recurrent
advanced adenomas as well as noncolorectal cancers.
Lifestyle

Alcohol induces cellular proliferation, blocks methyl group
donation, and inhibits DNA repair. Many observational studies have suggested a twofold to threefold increase in the risk of
colorectal cancer with excess alcohol consumption, although a
meta-analysis of 27 case-control and cohort studies found
only a 10% increase in risk among daily alcohol users.
Tobacco smoke contains numerous putative carcinogens,
including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, nitrosamines,
and aromatic amines. On the basis of data from several large
cohort studies, smoking appears to be a risk factor for colorectal cancer after a prolonged latency of 20 or more years.
Physical activity has been associated consistently with a
40% to 50% decrease in the risk of colorectal cancer, particularly in the distal colon, through the stimulation of intestinal
transit, decreased prostaglandin E2 levels, or other as-yetundeﬁned mechanisms.
Other

A meta-analysis of data from 15 observational studies found
that patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus had a 30% increase
in the risk of colorectal cancer compared with those without
diabetes. Insulin resistance has been proposed as the underlying mechanism of tumorigenesis.
Persons with acromegaly may be predisposed metabolically
or anatomically to higher risks of colorectal cancer. Because of

18 Colorectal Neoplasms

the relative rarity of this condition, most observational studies
have lacked adequate statistical power, but the preponderance
of evidence supports a positive risk association.
Cholecystectomy results in an altered fecal bile acid composition. Two meta-analyses have reported moderately
increased risks of 11% to 34% for colorectal cancer (mainly in
the proximal colon) after gallbladder surgery.

Heritable Syndromes

Cases of hereditary colorectal cancer account for approximately 15% of all large-bowel malignancies. Several welldeﬁned syndromes have been recognized, as discussed below.
It is important to remember that patients with gene mutations
are also at increased risk for target organ cancers outside the
colorectum.

209

Lynch Syndrome

Lynch syndrome (formerly called hereditary nonpolyposis
colorectal cancer) is an autosomal dominant syndrome characterized by early-onset colorectal cancer, usually located in
the proximal colon, and increased risk of extracolonic malignancies (uterus, ovaries, stomach, urinary tract, small bowel,
and bile duct). The clinical criteria for considering a person to
be at risk for Lynch syndrome are called the Amsterdam criteria (Table 18.2). The syndrome has been associated recently
with mutations in at least ﬁve DNA mismatch repair genes.
Adenomas are believed to precede carcinomas in most
instances, and colorectal cancer develops in 75% to 80% of
patients with Lynch syndrome, at a median age of 46 years.
It has been reported that regularly performed colonoscopy
with polypectomy can decrease the risk of large-bowel
adenocarcinoma for persons with Lynch syndrome by approximately 60%.

Familial Adenomatous Polyposis
Turcot’s Syndrome

Germline mutations in the APC gene form the basic molecular
foundation for familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) (autosomal dominant). As many as one in ﬁve cases may represent
new-onset spontaneous mutations. The estimated prevalence
is 1/5,000 to 7,500 persons. Additional genetic and environmental factors, as yet unidentiﬁed, seem likely to inﬂuence the
clinical manifestations of FAP because phenotypic features
vary widely despite similar inherited APC mutations. The hallmark lesion of FAP is diffuse colorectal polyposis, and, typically, hundreds to thousands of adenomas develop during
adolescence. Other ﬁndings include duodenal adenomas, gastric (fundic) gland hyperplasia, mandibular osteomas, and
supernumerary teeth. In the absence of prophylactic colectomy, colorectal carcinoma inevitably is diagnosed in patients
with FAP at a mean age of approximately 40 years. Even after
colectomy, increased cancer risks remain, particularly in the
periampullary region of the duodenum and in the retained
rectal remnant (if partial colectomy was performed).
Gardner’s syndrome is a variant of FAP in which patients
with APC mutations have the same phenotypic features as
classic FAP but in addition can have osteomas of the skull and
long bones, congenital hypertrophy of the retinal pigmented
epithelium, desmoid tumors, epidermoid cysts, ﬁbromas, and
lipomas.

Turcot’s syndrome refers to a familial predisposition for both
colonic polyposis and central nervous system tumors. It likely
represents a constellation of molecular features that can be
variants of either FAP or Lynch syndrome. Patients with earlyonset colonic polyposis associated with APC mutations tend
to have medulloblastomas (FAP variant), whereas those with
DNA mismatch repair gene mutations are prone to the development of glioblastoma multiforme (Lynch syndrome variant). Of interest, glioblastoma multiforme that arises in the
setting of Turcot’s syndrome tends to occur at an earlier age
and has a better prognosis than the sporadic form of the
tumor.
Muir-Torre Syndrome

Patients with Muir-Torre syndrome have sebaceous neoplasms, urogenital malignancies, and gastrointestinal tract
adenocarcinomas in association with defective DNA mismatch
repair. The ratio of affected men to women is 2:1.
MutYH-Associated Polyposis

MYH is a DNA base excision repair enzyme. MutYH-associated
polyposis (MAP) is an autosomal recessive syndrome with a

Attenuated Familial Adenomatous Polyposis

Attenuated FAP (AFAP) is associated with relatively fewer
adenomas (<100) and later onset of colorectal cancer (approximate age, 55 years) than in classic FAP. About 40% of these
cases can be found to be associated with germline APC mutations. Because both the adenomas and the cancers appear to
arise in the proximal colon, at-risk family members should
have screening with full colonoscopy rather than ﬂexible sigmoidoscopy, as recommended for screening in classic FAP
kindreds.

wide-ranging phenotype. The colorectal adenoma burden in
MAP can be similar to that of AFAP, but patients with MAP
who have more than 100 adenomas have been described. Also,
duodenal and periampullary adenomas can be found in
patients with MAP, although the true incidence of upper gastrointestinal tract neoplasia is not known. Biallelic carriers, or
persons with mutations in both MYH alleles, have an 80%
cumulative risk of colorectal cancer by age 70 years, but
monoallelic carriers do not appear to have an increased risk
for colorectal cancer.
Hamartomatous Polyposis Syndromes
Peutz-Jeghers Syndrome

Peutz-Jeghers syndrome is an autosomal dominant condition
characterized by multiple hamartomatous polyps scattered
throughout the gastrointestinal tract. Up to 60% of cases of
the syndrome are related to germline mutations in the LKB1
(STK11) gene. Melanin deposits usually can be seen around
the lips, buccal mucosa, face, genitalia, hands, and feet,
although occasionally the skin and intestinal lesions are inherited separately. Foci of adenomatous epithelium can develop
within Peutz-Jeghers polyps and may be associated directly
with an increased risk of colorectal cancer. Extracolonic malignancies include other gastrointestinal cancers (duodenum,
jejunum, ileum, pancreas, biliary tree, and gallbladder), ovarian sex cord tumors, Sertoli cell testicular tumors, and breast
cancer.
Tuberous Sclerosis

Tuberous sclerosis (autosomal dominant) is associated with
hamartomas, mental retardation, epilepsy, and adenoma sebaceum. Adenomatous polyps may occur, particularly in the
distal colon.
Juvenile Polyposis Syndrome

Juvenile polyposis syndrome is an autosomal dominant condition in which juvenile mucous retention polyps (misnamed
hamartomata) can arise in the colon, stomach, or elsewhere in
the gastrointestinal tract. Both PTEN and SMAD4 mutations
have been implicated as genetic causes of the syndrome.
Symptoms of bleeding or obstruction may arise during childhood and may warrant surgery on the affected intestinal segments for treatment of anemia or obstruction or for cancer
prevention. The risk of colorectal cancer is increased when
synchronous adenomas or mixed juvenile-adenomatous
polyps are present. If prophylactic or therapeutic colonic
resection is performed, ileorectostomy or total proctocolectomy should be considered because of an increased risk of
recurrent juvenile polyps within the retained colorectal segment. Of note, fewer than ﬁve juvenile polyps (including solitary polyps) in a person with no family history of juvenile
polyposis syndrome does not indicate a heritable syndrome

and, on the basis of current knowledge, does not warrant further diagnostic testing or aggressive cancer surveillance.
Cowden Disease

Cowden disease is an autosomal dominant condition in which
persons with PTEN mutations may have trichilemmomas,
other skin lesions, and alimentary tract polyps that are histologically similar to the polyps of juvenile polyposis syndrome.
Patients with Cowden disease are at increased risk for breast
cancer (often bilateral) and papillary thyroid cancer. The risk
of colorectal cancer is not well-deﬁned in this syndrome, but
colonoscopy should be included in the original diagnostic
evaluation.
Cronkhite-Canada Syndrome

Cronkhite-Canada syndrome refers to a noninherited condition manifested by signs and symptoms of malnutrition or
malabsorption. Gastrointestinal tract hamartomas may be
present and can exhibit foci of adenomatous epithelium.
Characteristic clinical features include alopecia and hyperkeratosis of the ﬁngernails and toenails. In the United States
and Europe, Cronkhite-Canada syndrome typically develops
in men, whereas in Asian countries, women appear to be
affected more often.
Prevention
Screening and Surveillance

For average-risk patients (deﬁned as asymptomatic adults,
50 years or older, without other known risk factors for colorectal cancer), several screening options have been endorsed
by major primary care and subspecialty organizations, as
follows:
• Fecal occult blood test or fecal immunochemical test
every year
• Flexible sigmoidoscopy every 5 years
• Fecal occult blood test or fecal immunochemical test
every year plus ﬂexible sigmoidoscopy every 5 years
• Double-contrast barium enema every 5 years
• Colonoscopy every 10 years
Also, emerging technologies, such as CT colonography and
DNA-based stool tests, show considerable promise. Diagnostic
colonoscopy should be performed in follow-up of any screening test with positive ﬁndings.
For high-risk patients, the following recommendations
have been adopted:
• FAP—ﬂexible sigmoidoscopy at the onset of puberty for
indeterminate cases
• Lynch syndrome—colonoscopy every 1 or 2 years, beginning at age 20 years; it should be performed annually
after age 40 years

18 Colorectal Neoplasms

• Peutz-Jeghers syndrome—initial screening colonoscopy
during the second decade of life, with subsequent surveillance intervals determined by examination ﬁndings
• Strong family history of colorectal neoplasia (excluding
FAP, Lynch syndrome, or other identiﬁable
syndromes)—colonoscopy every 5 years beginning at
age 40 years (or 10 years before the youngest case diagnosis in the family, whichever is earlier). For patients
with one ﬁrst-degree relative diagnosed at age 60 years
or older or two second-degree relatives with colorectal
cancer diagnosed at any age, any of the endorsed screening options may be selected, beginning at age 40 years
(rather than age 50 years for average-risk patients)
• Inﬂammatory bowel disease—annual colonoscopy with
surveillance biopsies, beginning 8 to 10 years after the
onset of colitis.

In its broadest sense, chemoprevention includes both nutritional and pharmaceutical interventions. With regard to pharmaceutical agents, nonsteroidal antiinﬂammatory drugs are
structurally diverse, yet appear to share abilities to decrease
proliferation, slow cell cycle progression, and stimulate apoptosis. Extensive epidemiologic data uphold a negative risk
(40%–60%) association between regular use of nonsteroidal
antiinﬂammatory drugs and colorectal tumors. The chemopreventive effects of these drugs are thought to be derived
through cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 inhibition, and agents that
selectively block this enzyme isoform (celecoxib and rofecoxib) have been shown in several large clinical trials to
decrease the recurrence rates of adenoma. However, selective
COX-2 inhibitors have been associated also with increased
cardiovascular toxicity, which has limited their chemopreventive applications to high-risk clinical settings (such as adjunct
therapy for FAP).

History of Colorectal Neoplasia

After a complete clearing colonoscopy has been performed,
repeat examinations can be delayed for patients who have one
or two tubular adenomas that are smaller than 1 cm and have
low-grade dysplasia at baseline. Surveillance colonoscopy is
indicated at 3 years for patients with advanced adenomas or
3 to 10 adenomas at baseline. Family history should be considered on a case-by-case basis when determining postpolypectomy surveillance intervals. Patients with more than
10 adenomas at a single examination should have colonoscopy
again in less than 3 years.
Patients with large (>2 cm), sessile adenomas that are
removed piecemeal should have endoscopy repeated in 2 to
6 months. Residual adenomatous tissue after two or three
therapeutic colonoscopies should prompt surgical consultation. Malignant polyps, deﬁned as neoplasms with dysplastic
cells invading through the muscularis mucosa, can be treated
endoscopically if 1) the lesion has been excised completely and
fully examined by a pathologist; 2) the depth of invasion,
grade of differentiation, and completeness of excision can be
determined accurately; 3) poor differentiation, vascular invasion, and lymphatic involvement are not present; and 4) the
margin of excision is free of cancer cells. Follow-up colonoscopy should be performed at 3 months for malignant polyps
that meet these favorable prognostic criteria.
Patients with potentially curable colon or rectal cancer
should have a clearing colonoscopy preoperatively or within
3 to 6 months postoperatively if obstructive lesions prevented
preoperative colonoscopy. After clearing colonoscopy, subsequent surveillance examinations can be performed at 1 year,
3 years, and 5 years if no additional colorectal neoplasia is
found.
Chemoprevention

Chemoprevention refers to the use of chemical compounds to
prevent, inhibit, or reverse carcinogenesis before the invasion
of dysplastic epithelial cells across the basement membrane.

Treatment of Colon Cancer

In the absence of known distant metastases or prohibitive
comorbid conditions, surgical excision is the initial treatment
modality for most patients who have colon cancer. Typical
operations for colon cancer include segmental resection. The
procedures can be performed through an open incision or laparoscopically, if technically feasible. More extensive operations such as subtotal colectomy or proctocolectomy can be
performed for patients who have colorectal neoplasia in multiple colonic segments or familial cancer syndromes, respectively. Operative intervention also may be considered for
selected patients who have isolated liver or lung metastases.
Postoperative, or adjuvant, chemotherapy is recommended
for patients with stage III colon cancer. It should be considered also for patients with stage II colon cancer who have poor
prognostic factors, as based on pathology review. The preferred regimen includes 5-ﬂuorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) for 6 months.
Adenocarcinomas in the middle and upper rectum usually
are removed by anterior resection, with colorectal anastomosis. Cancers in the lower rectum (0-5 cm above the anal verge)
often require abdominoperineal resection, with a permanent
colostomy, although anterior resection with low coloanal
anastomosis may be considered for some patients. Preoperative,
or neoadjuvant, treatment with 5-ﬂuorouracil–based chemotherapy in combination with radiotherapy generally is indicated for patients with tumors that are staged with CT and
endoscopic ultrasonography as T3 and higher or N1 and
higher. Adjuvant chemotherapy with 5-ﬂuorouracil and leucovorin (with or without oxaliplatin) is recommended for
patients with stage II or stage III rectal cancer. Molecularly
targeted therapies (eg, bevacizumab and cetuximab) are being
investigated as adjuvant therapy and have demonstrated clear
beneﬁts for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. These
agents are recombinant humanized monoclonal IgG1 antibodies that bind to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)

212

Section V Colon

and prevent the proliferation of endothelial cells and formation of new blood vessels. K-ras tumor testing is used to select
which patients will best respond to a VEGF inhibitor. VEGF
inhibitors may improve outcome in patients with advanced
tumors with K-ras mutations, but they are not indicated for
patients with wild-type K-ras in their tumors.

Irritable Bowel Syndromea
G. Richard Locke III, MD

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common condition that
contributes substantially to health care costs. Because the
cause is not known and no curative therapy is available, IBS
historically has been managed symptomatically. Recent discoveries in the physiology of the enteric nervous system, the
gut-brain axis, and the intestinal ﬂora have led to the development of therapies targeted at potential pathophysiologic
mechanisms of IBS. In addition, the role of psychologic issues
has been well recognized, and therapy directed at behavioral
intervention has been used more extensively than in the past.
The overall goal is to improve the patient’s symptoms and
overall quality of life and, ideally, to prevent the suffering that
patients experience.

Deﬁnitiona

The symptom criteria for IBS are listed in the Table 19.1. The
Rome criteria were developed in conjunction with the World
Congress of Gastroenterology held in Rome, Italy, in 1988 and
were revised (Rome II) in 1999 and again in 2006 (Rome III).
The Rome criteria are similar to the criteria established by
Manning et al in 1978. However, a goal of the Rome criteria
was to incorporate constipation-type symptoms into the deﬁnition of IBS.
As with any set of criteria, there is a trade-off between sensitivity and speciﬁcity, depending on the threshold used. In
clinical practice, this can be helpful. The more criteria a speciﬁc patient meets, the more likely the patient is to have IBS.

Nonetheless, the diagnosis of IBS can be made only if there are
not any structural or metabolic abnormalities that explain the
symptoms.

Epidemiology

IBS is thought to be a common condition. Many populationbased surveys have assessed the individual symptoms of IBS.
The prevalence rates for symptom reporting have varied
between 8 and 22 per 100 adults. It is simplest to think of the
prevalence of IBS as 10% (1 in 10).
Although many studies have assessed the prevalence of IBS,
data on incidence are more difﬁcult to obtain. Because not
everyone with IBS seeks medical care, data on incidence need
to come from a population-based study. The exact number
has varied among surveys, but about 10% of the general population report the onset of symptoms of IBS over a 1-year
period. However, it is not known whether these people had
the syndrome in the past. Thus, this is an onset rate rather
than a true incidence rate. Approximately one-third of persons with IBS report that symptoms resolve over time. One
estimate of the incidence of clinically diagnosed IBS is 196 per
100,000 person-years. This clinical incidence ﬁgure is lower
213

214

Section V Colon

than the 10% onset ﬁgure, which likely reﬂects both the ﬂuctuating pattern of symptoms and the limited seeking of health
care by persons with IBS. Still, this is much higher than the
incidence of colon cancer (50 per 100,000 person-years) and
inﬂammatory bowel disease (10 per 100,000 person-years).
Risk Factors

Multiple risk factors have been proposed for IBS. In clinicbased studies, there is a strong association with sex. However,
the female-to-male ratio in the community is approximately
2:1. Thus, gender may have a role not only in the onset of IBS
but also in health care-seeking behavior. The prevalence of
IBS decreases slightly with age. However, the new onset of
symptoms may occur in the elderly. Prevalence estimates now
are available from around the world. No consistent racial or
ethnic differences have been identiﬁed.
Multiple studies have assessed the role of personality characteristics, psychiatric illness, and physical and sexual abuse in
the development of IBS. These problems are common in
patients with IBS evaluated in academic medical centers.
However, persons in the community who have IBS are much
less distressed.
Many patients with IBS report that a family member also
has the condition. Familial aggregation of IBS exists, and twin
studies have suggested a genetic component. However, other
studies have shown that seeking health care for gastrointestinal problems is increased among children of parents with gastrointestinal symptoms. Additional study is needed to separate
nature from nurture in the development of IBS.
IBS symptoms can occur after acute inﬂammatory conditions such as Salmonella infection. The propensity for the
development of postinfectious IBS is associated with gender,
duration of illness, and the psychologic state of the person at
the time of infection. Inﬂammatory markers have been identiﬁed in the colons of people with postinfectious IBS. The concept of postinfectious IBS is being actively investigated.
Food allergies or sensitivities also may have a role in the
development of IBS. Patients with IBS symptoms report more
sensitivity to food than people without symptoms. However,
the data on exclusion diets have not convincingly shown that
food is a cause of the symptoms.
Pathogenesis

The cause of IBS is not completely understood. However, IBS
has been associated consistently with visceral hypersensitivity.
Balloon distention studies have shown that patients with IBS
feel discomfort at a lower volume than do subjects without
IBS. Patients with IBS and subjects without IBS do equally well
on tests of somatic pain such as cold water immersion, suggesting that IBS is a disorder speciﬁc to the gut. Balloon distention studies also have suggested that patients with IBS have
hypersensitivity throughout the gastrointestinal tract. The frequent overlap between IBS and ﬁbromyalgia and urinary

symptoms suggests that the problem may be an even more diffuse visceral hypersensitivity.
More recently, imaging studies of the central nervous
system during balloon distention have shown that a different
part of the brain is activated during balloon distention in
patients with IBS than in healthy controls. Considerable
advances have been made in understanding this brain-gut
axis. The concept of a “big brain” in the cranial vault and a
“little brain” in the abdomen has gained widespread acceptance. With this understanding, research has been undertaken
to evaluate compounds that affect central nervous system
activity to determine whether they have a role in the management of IBS. Serotonin has been investigated most intensively.
The pathophysiologic state of carcinoid diarrhea shows that
serotonin has a role in gastrointestinal physiology. Other studies have shown that serotonin has a role in visceral hypersensitivity, which increasingly is viewed as the primary
pathophysiologic mechanism of IBS. The roles of opioid
receptors, cholecystokinin receptors, dopamine receptors,
cannabinoid receptors, and α-adrenergic agonists are being
actively investigated.
Increasing attention is now focused on the role of the bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract and the development of IBS
symptoms. Small-bowel bacterial overgrowth may be the
cause of IBS in such patients. Whether this is true or the bacterial overgrowth is the result of an underlying dysmotility is
still being studied. Also, the colon has a large number of
bacteria. Investigation of speciﬁc ﬂora in the large bowel is
beginning.

Diagnosis

The diagnosis of IBS is made on the basis of symptom criteria
(Table 19.1), in the absence of structural or metabolic abnormalities that can explain the symptoms. Many disorders can
cause abdominal pain. However, the combination of abdominal pain and abnormal defecation has a more limited differential diagnosis. Colon cancer, inﬂammatory bowel disease,
thyroid disorders, celiac disease, and giardiasis are all relatively
common conditions that can have similar symptoms.
Carcinoid syndrome, microscopic colitis, bacterial overgrowth, and eosinophilic gastroenteritis also can have similar
symptoms, but they are less common. The problem is that IBS
is so common that it is difﬁcult to justify performing extensive
diagnostic tests on a large proportion of the population. All
tests will have a very low yield.
Young patients with classic symptoms of IBS do not necessarily need any tests when they present to their primary care
provider. Simple blood tests, stool tests for ova and parasites
and occult blood, and an anatomical evaluation of the colon
may be considered (Fig. 19.1). Patients older than 50 years
need a full colonic evaluation to exclude colorectal cancer.
Recent studies have heightened the awareness about celiac
disease. Although much needs to be learned about how
common the diagnosis of sprue is among patients who present

with symptoms of IBS, clinicians should consider some form
of testing for sprue in these patients.
As noted, bacterial overgrowth has been reported in
patients with IBS. The proportions have varied greatly
(10%–70%), which may reﬂect on the validity of the tests
used. Whether patients with bacterial overgrowth should still
be considered to have IBS or given a separate diagnosis is an
open question.

Prognosis

The natural history of IBS is becoming better understood. In
approximately 30% of patients, the symptoms resolve over the
course of a year. This contributes to the placebo response rate,
which has made evaluation of investigative agents difﬁcult.
Although IBS symptoms may resolve, symptoms of another
functional gastrointestinal disorder develop in some patients.
Thus, the degree to which the gastrointestinal symptoms

resolve completely is not clear. A pattern of coming, going,
and changing over time is quite common.

Management

Although IBS often is managed with a high ﬁber diet and antispasmodic agents, an approach that considers the patient’s
predominant symptom is recommended (Fig. 19.1). Does the
patient complain primarily of constipation, diarrhea, or
abdominal pain? Constipation can be treated with laxatives
and a high ﬁber diet, and diarrhea may be treated with loperamide, especially when taken before meals. A high ﬁber diet
may be helpful for patients who alternate between constipation and diarrhea, but the effectiveness of a high ﬁber diet in
diarrhea-predominant IBS is unproven. Antispasmodic agents
are appropriate for patients who have primarily abdominal
pain. These agents have been prescribed because of the belief
that the pathophysiologic mechanism of IBS is spasms and

216

Section V Colon

irregular contractility. The clinical trial data on the effectiveness of antispasmodic agents are mixed. However, with the
absence of alternative medications, antispasmodic agents have
been used widely. In each case, a dietary history is important
to ensure that the patient is not consuming products that may
inadvertently cause diarrhea, constipation, or abdominal gas.
Further evaluation should be withheld until the initial treatment program is undertaken (3–6 weeks).
The hope is that the patient will be reassured about the
diagnosis and will have a response to the initial therapy.
However, some patients continue to have pronounced symptoms and seek care. What are the options for these patients?
For constipation, therapy typically is laxatives. Further testing
and treatment are based on the predominant symptom.
Patients with refractory constipation need to be evaluated for
problems of colonic transit and pelvic ﬂoor dysfunction (see
Chapter 20, Constipation and Disorders of Pelvic Floor
Function). Patients with pelvic ﬂoor dysfunction may beneﬁt
from biofeedback.
Patients with documented delay in colonic transit may be
considered for colonic resection. However, if the patient has
symptoms of IBS, surgery for colonic inertia needs to be considered carefully because the abdominal pain may persist
postoperatively. Lubiprostone has been approved for treating
IBS and constipation. Otherwise, most treatments are laxatives such as polyethylene glycol, which are now available over
the counter.
For patients with diarrhea, stool chemistry tests for surreptitious laxative abuse, duodenal aspirate for bacterial overgrowth, colonic biopsies for microscopic colitis, determination
of urinary 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid for carcinoid syndrome,
and a small-bowel colonic transit study may all be considered.
The yield of these tests is low, but they are useful for evaluating
patients who have chronic diarrhea with increased stool
volume. Treatment with high-dose loperamide (up to 16 mg
daily), cholestyramine, clonidine, verapamil, alosetron, or
even octreotide may be considered. Most of these treatments
are off label. Only alosetron has been approved by the US
Food and Drug Administration, but the risk of ischemic colitis
has led to a restricted prescription program.
Many physicians consider pain-predominant IBS the most
challenging to manage. A plain radiograph of the abdomen
obtained during a time of severe pain may help to exclude
obstruction. In academic medical centers, pseudo-obstruction
or other motility disorders may be evaluated, but pain is not
common in these conditions. Often, the next step is a course
of treatment with a low dose of a tricyclic antidepressant. The
goal is not to alleviate depression but rather to reduce visceral
sensation.
Some patients with IBS report bloating as the major symptom. Studies have reported some beneﬁt with probiotics.
The association between psychologic distress and IBS is
well established. When formal psychiatric disorders are present, appropriate therapy directed toward treating the underlying disorder is mandatory. Even when there is no diagnosis of
a psychiatric disorder, the approach of using psychologic

intervention is helpful in the management of IBS. When traditional symptomatic measures have not been adequate, treatment with low doses of tricyclic antidepressants or selective
serotonin reuptake inhibitors has provided improvement for
many patients. The pathophysiologic mechanism of tricyclic
antidepressants is not clear. The dosages used are much lower
than those used to treat depression. In a randomized clinical
trial, tricyclic antidepressants were helpful for people who did
not experience side effects (per protocol analysis). In the
intention-to-treat analysis, cognitive behavioral therapy was
shown to be effective. Patients with IBS refractory to other
treatment may beneﬁt from formal pain management
approaches.

Health Care Utilization

Annually, IBS accounts for 3.5 million physician visits,
2.2 million prescriptions, and 35,000 hospitalizations. Primary
care physicians provide most care for patients with IBS,
although a survey of gastroenterologists indicated that 28%
of their patient population had IBS. The exact expenditures
accountable to IBS are difﬁcult to determine. In one study,
subjects with IBS in the community were found to incur an
extra $300 annually in health care expenditures. Extrapolated
to the US population, this is equal to $8 billion. Also, IBS
is associated with absenteeism. This and other indirect
costs to patients and their families make the total cost of IBS
considerable.

Summary

During the past few years, important changes have occurred in
the management of IBS. The traditional approach of reassurance and a high ﬁber diet is no longer adequate for everyone.
Symptomatic care likely will remain the appropriate treatment
for patients with mild symptoms. However, for patients with
pronounced gastrointestinal symptoms, more aggressive
approaches will be necessary. In time, the role of newer medications will be established. Similarly, the adjunctive use of
behavioral intervention will gain wider use.

Function

Colonic functions include the absorption of water and electrolytes, storage of intraluminal contents until elimination is
socially convenient, and nutrient salvage from bacterial
metabolism of carbohydrates that are not absorbed in the
small intestine. The colon absorbs all but 100 mL of ﬂuid and
1 mEq of sodium and chloride from approximately 1,500 mL
of chyme received over 24 hours. Absorptive capacity can
increase to 5 to 6 L of ﬂuid and 800 to 1,000 mEq of sodium
and chloride daily. In healthy subjects, the average mouth-tocecum transit time is approximately 6 hours, and average
regional transit times through the right, left, and sigmoid

Regional Differences in Colonic Motor Function

The right colon is a reservoir that mixes and stores contents
and absorbs ﬂuid and electrolytes. The left colon is primarily a
conduit, whereas the rectum and anal canal are responsible for
continence and defecation. The ileocolic sphincter regulates
the intermittent transfer of ileal contents into the colon, a process that normalizes in response to augmented storage capacity in the residual transverse and descending colon within
6 months after right hemicolectomy.
Motor Patterns

Colonic motor activity is extremely irregular, ranging from
quiescence (particularly at night) to isolated contractions,
bursts of contractions, or propagated contractions. In contrast
to the small intestine, rhythmic migrating motor complexes
do not occur. Contractions are tonic or sustained, lasting
several minutes to hours, and shorter or phasic. Propagated
phasic contractions propel colonic contents over longer
distances than nonpropagated phasic contractions. Highamplitude propagated contractions are more than 75 mm Hg
in amplitude, occur about 6 times daily (frequently after awakening and after meals), are responsible for mass movement of
colonic contents, and frequently precede defecation. Stimulant
laxatives such as bisacodyl (Dulcolax) and glycerol induce
high-amplitude propagated contractions.
Colonic Contractile Response to a Meal

Neurohormonal mechanisms are responsible for increased
colonic motor activity beginning within a few minutes after
ingestion of a meal of 500 kcal or more. The term “gastrocolic
reﬂex” is a misnomer because this response, induced by gastric
distention and chemical stimulation by nutrients, is observed
219

220

Section V Colon

even after gastrectomy. This response may explain postprandial urgency and abdominal discomfort in patients with irritable bowel syndrome.
Colonic Relaxation

Colonic relaxation resulting from sympathetic stimulation or
opiates may cause acute colonic pseudo-obstruction, or
Ogilvie’s syndrome. Stimulation of α2-adrenergic receptors
decreases the release of acetylcholine from excitatory cholinergic terminals in the myenteric plexus, thereby inhibiting
gastrointestinal motility. Conversely, reduced tonic inhibition
of the sympathetic system impairs the net absorption of water
and electrolytes and accelerates transit in patients who have
diabetic neuropathy, thus explaining their diarrhea. Clonidine
restores the sympathetic brake, reducing diarrhea.
Colocolonic Inhibitory Reﬂexes

Peristalsis is a local reﬂex mediated by intrinsic nerve pathways and characterized by contraction proximal to and relaxation distal to the distended segment. In addition, rectal or
colonic distention can inhibit motor activity in the stomach,
small intestine, or colon. These inhibitory reﬂexes are mediated by extrinsic reﬂex pathways with synapses in the prevertebral ganglia, independent of the central nervous system.
They may account for delayed left colonic or small intestinal
(or both) transit in patients with obstructive defecation.
Serotonin and the Gut

About 95% of the body’s serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine
[5-HT]), a monoamine neurotransmitter, is in the gut: 90%
in enterochromafﬁn cells and 10% in enteric neurons. The
effects of serotonin are mediated by receptors located on gut
neurons, smooth muscle, and enterochromafﬁn cells. There
are seven families of 5-HT receptors. The 5-HT3 and 5-HT4
receptors and, to a lesser degree, 5-HT1p, 5-HT1a, and 5-HT2
receptors are important targets of pharmacologic modulation
in the gut. Cisapride, prucalopride, and tegaserod maleate
(Zelnorm) are 5-HT4 receptor agonists. Alosetron and cilansetron are more potent 5-HT3 receptor antagonists than
ondansetron.
The effects of 5-HT are as follows:
Motor—Stimulation of serotoninergic 5-HT4 receptors
facilitates both components of the peristaltic reﬂex, that is,
proximal excitation coordinated with distal inhibition. Thus,
stimulation of 5-HT4 receptors located on cholinergic enteric
neurons induces the release of acetylcholine and enhances
contractility, whereas 5-HT4 receptor-mediated stimulation of
inhibitory neurons releases inhibitory neurotransmitters, for
example, nitric oxide or vasoactive intestinal polypeptide,
which relax smooth muscle.
Sensory—5-HT3 and 5-HT4 receptors are located on intrinsic primary afferent neurons, which initiate peristaltic and

secretory reﬂexes. 5-HT3 receptors are located also on extrinsic sensory afferents and vagal afferents, partly explaining why
5-HT3 antagonists reduce nausea.
Other—Central 5-HT participates in the regulation of
appetite, sexual function, and mood.
Assessment of Colonic Transit

Colonic transit can be measured with commercially available
radiopaque markers (Sitz capsule). These techniques entail
counting the number of orally ingested markers that remain
in the colon as seen on plain radiographs of the abdomen. One
approach is to administer a capsule containing 20 markers on
day 1. Delayed colonic transit is manifested by eight or more
markers seen on plain ﬁlms on day 3 or by ﬁve or more markers seen on day 5. With scintigraphy, the isotope (generally
99m Tc or 111In) is delivered into the colon by orocecal intubation or within a delayed-release capsule. The delayed-release
capsule contains radiolabeled activated charcoal covered with
a pH-sensitive polymer (methacrylate) designed to dissolve in
the alkaline pH of the distal ileum. This releases the radioisotope within the ascending colon. Gamma camera scans taken
4, 24, and, if necessary, 48 hours after ingestion of the isotope
show the colonic distribution of isotope. Regions of interest
are drawn around the ascending, transverse, descending, and
sigmoid colon and the rectum; counts in these areas are
weighted by factors 1 through 4, respectively, and stool counts
are weighted by a factor of 5. Thus, colonic transit may be
summarized as an overall geometric center (Fig. 20.1). The
4-hour scan identiﬁes rapid colonic transit, and the 24-hour
and 48-hour scans show slow colonic transit. Assessments of
colonic transit made with radiopaque markers are comparable
to those made with scintigraphy. The radiopaque marker
technique is simpler and more widely available. However, with
scintigraphy, colonic transit can be assessed in 48 hours, compared with 5 to 7 days for radiopaque markers. Moreover, gastric, small intestinal, and colonic transit can be assessed
simultaneously with scintigraphy.
Constipation
Deﬁnition

A committee of experts developed symptom-based criteria
(the Rome criteria) for diagnosing functional gastrointestinal
disorders. These criteria are essential for clinical trials and
research studies but are also useful in clinical practice. By convention, these symptom criteria need to be present for at least
3 months, with a total symptom duration of 6 months or
longer. Functional constipation is deﬁned by two or more of
the following symptoms: 1) fewer than three defecations per
week, 2) straining, 3) lumpy or hard stools, 4) sensation of
incomplete evacuations, 5) sensation of anorectal obstruction
or blockage, and 6) manual maneuvers to facilitate defecation.
For symptoms 2 through 6 to be considered present, they

should occur with one-fourth of defecations. Constipationpredominant irritable bowel syndrome is deﬁned by abdominal
discomfort and at least two of the following three symptoms:
1) abdominal discomfort associated with change in stool form,
2) abdominal discomfort associated with change in stool frequency, and 3) abdominal discomfort relieved by defecation.
Clinical Assessment

Clinical assessment should focus on identifying 1) secondary
causes of constipation (Tables 20.1 and 20.2), 2) inadequate
dietary intake of calories and ﬁber, 3) a history of physical,
emotional, or sexual abuse, and 4) obstructive defecation.
Bowel diaries are more accurate than self-reporting for characterizing bowel habits, particularly stool frequency. Extremes of
stool form, that is, hard small pebbles or watery stools, characterized by the Bristol stool form scale, correlate strongly with
delayed and accelerated colonic transit, respectively. In contrast to stool frequency recorded by diaries, frequency based
on recall alone does not correlate with colonic transit. Certain
symptoms (prolonged straining, sense of anorectal blockage, a
tendency to facilitate defecation by assuming different positions, difﬁculty in evacuating soft stool, and digital maneuvers
to facilitate defecation) are suggestive but not diagnostic of
functional defecatory disorders. The examination may demonstrate anismus, inadequate perineal descent, or, conversely,
ballooning of the perineum with excessive descent.
Practical Classiﬁcation of Constipation

After secondary causes of constipation are excluded, colonic
transit and anorectal functions should be assessed in patients
with constipation that does not respond to dietary ﬁber supplementation (Table 20.3). This approach facilitates the management of chronic constipation. Normal-transit constipation
includes irritable bowel syndrome and functional constipation. In irritable bowel syndrome, abdominal pain is associated with defecation or a change in bowel habits (ie, harder or

less frequent stools). Patients with functional constipation
also may have abdominal pain, but by deﬁnition the pain is
not relieved by defecation or associated temporally with harder
or less frequent stools. Pelvic ﬂoor function should be assessed
in refractory constipation because symptoms alone cannot
distinguish among constipation resulting from pelvic ﬂoor
dysfunction, normal transit, and slow transit. Most patients
with obstructive defecation also have delayed colonic transit.
Consequently, delayed colonic transit does not imply slowtransit constipation.
Colonic inertia refers to severe colonic motor dysfunction
that is identiﬁed by reduced colonic contractile responses to a
meal and stimulants such as bisacodyl or neostigmine, as

Management of Constipation
Principles

Reassurance and education about normal bowel habits, the
need for adequate caloric intake and dietary ﬁber supplementation, and the absence of a “serious disorder” are vital.
Deﬁcient caloric intake can cause or exacerbate constipation,
whereas refeeding may restore colonic transit.
Medical Therapy

A stepwise approach that begins with dietary ﬁber supplementation and osmotic or stimulant laxatives should be used to
manage constipation. These agents are relatively safe, inexpensive, and widely used, and, in many cases, efﬁcacy has been
proven in controlled trials. Colonic transit and anorectal functions should be evaluated in patients who do not have a
response to these agents. This evaluation should be considered
earlier if defecatory disorders are strongly suspected clinically.
For normal-transit and slow-transit constipation, treatment
with laxatives or a secretagogue (ie, lubiprostone), or both,
should be considered. Pelvic ﬂoor retraining by biofeedback
therapy is required for defecatory disorders.
Increasing dietary ﬁber either with food or a ﬁber supplement increases stool weight and accelerates colonic transit.
Fiber intake should be increased gradually to 12 to 15 g daily:
psyllium (Konsyl, Metamucil), daily with ﬂuid, or methylcellulose (Citrucel), 1 tsp up to 3 times daily; Konsyl, 2 tsp twice
daily; calcium polycarbophil (FiberCon), 2 to 4 tablets daily;
bran, 1 cup daily. Fiber supplements are more effective in
normal-transit or “ﬁber-deﬁciency” constipation than in
slow-transit constipation or pelvic ﬂoor dysfunction. Fiber
supplementation should start at a small dose administered
twice daily (am and pm) with ﬂuids or meals, increasing the
dose gradually after 7 to 10 days. Patients should be reassured
that although ﬁber supplements may increase gaseousness,
this often subsides with time. A response to ﬁber supplements
is evident over several weeks, not over days, as with a laxative.
Bloating may be reduced by gradually titrating the dose of

dietary ﬁber to the recommended dose or by switching to a
synthetic ﬁber preparation such as methylcellulose. Bran
impairs absorption of iron and calcium. Fiber supplements
are contraindicated for patients with intestinal obstruction,
fecal impaction, or severe vomiting.
• Dietary ﬁber content should be increased gradually to
12–15 g daily for patients with constipation.
• In normal-transit constipation, 80% of patients have a
symptomatic response to dietary ﬁber supplementation.
Hyperosmolar agents, sorbitol or lactulose (15–30 mL once
or twice daily), are nonabsorbable disaccharides metabolized
by colonic bacteria into acetic and other short-chain fatty
acids. Sorbitol and lactulose accelerate proximal colonic transit in healthy subjects. Both agents may cause transient
abdominal cramps and ﬂatulence. They are equally effective
for treating constipation in the elderly. However, lactulose
($0.63–$1.26 per dose) is extremely sweet and more expensive
than sorbitol ($0.57–$1.14 per dose). A controlled study
showed that polyethylene glycol (MiraLAX), 17 g daily for
6 months, is superior to placebo for improving symptoms in
chronic constipation. Oral sodium phosphate solution is used
for bowel cleansing, occasionally by patients with severe constipation. However, acute phosphate nephropathy (acute
nephrocalcinosis), a type of acute renal failure, rarely progressing to chronic renal impairment and long-term dialysis,
has been reported in patients who took oral sodium phosphate. Renal tubular injury occurs from the deposition of calcium phosphate crystals in the distal tubules and collecting
ducts, as shown histologically. Crystals form because of an
abnormally high concentration of calcium phosphate from
oral sodium phosphate-induced dehydration, decreased intravascular volume, and hyperphosphatemia, which is compounded further by reabsorption of water from renal tubules.
Risk factors for acute phosphate nephropathy include
advanced age (greater severity for patients 57 years and older),
decreased intravascular volume (eg, congestive heart failure,
cirrhosis, or nephrotic syndrome), acute or chronic kidney
disease, and concomitant use of drugs that affect renal perfusion or function (diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme
inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and possibly nonsteroidal antiinﬂammatory drugs).
Saline laxative, milk of magnesia (15–30 mL once or twice
daily), draws ﬂuid osmotically into the lumen, stimulates the
release of cholecystokinin, and accelerates colonic transit. It
may cause hypermagnesemia, particularly in patients with
renal insufﬁciency.
• Patients with slow-transit constipation can take saline
laxatives or hyperosmolar agents daily and stimulant
laxatives on an as-needed basis.
• Sorbitol is as effective but less expensive and less sweet
than lactulose.
• Oral sodium phosphate solution should be used with
care because rarely it can cause acute phosphate nephropathy and renal failure.

20 Constipation and Disorders of Pelvic Floor Function

Stimulant laxatives affect mucosal transport and motility
and include surface-active agents (docusate sodium [Colace],
100 mg orally twice daily), diphenylmethane derivatives, ricinoleic acid, anthraquinones, glycerin (suppository), and bisacodyl (10-mg tablet or suppository). Stool softeners such as
docusate sodium are of limited efﬁcacy. Glycerin and bisacodyl, taken up to once every other day, work by inducing
colonic high-amplitude propagated contractions. Bisacodyl
tablets take effect in 6 to 8 hours, and suppositories should be
administered 30 minutes after eating to maximize synergism
with the gastrocolic reﬂex. Of the diphenylmethane derivatives, phenolphthalein was withdrawn from the US market
after animal studies suggested that it may be carcinogenic;
however, no epidemiologic evidence supports this claim. The
anthraquinone compounds may cause allergic reactions, electrolyte depletion, melanosis coli, and cathartic colon. Melanosis
coli refers to brownish black colorectal pigmentation of
unknown composition associated with apoptosis of colonic
epithelial cells. Cathartic colon refers to altered colonic structure observed on barium enema studies and associated with
long-term use of stimulant laxatives. The altered structure
includes colonic dilatation, loss of haustral folds, strictures,
colonic redundancy, and wide gaping of the ileocecal valve.
Early reports implicating laxative-induced destruction of
myenteric plexus neurons in cathartic colon have been disputed. Although anthraquinones may induce colorectal
tumors in animal models, several cohorts and a recent casecontrol study failed to ﬁnd an association between anthraquinones and colon cancer.
• Bisacodyl and glycerin facilitate defecation by inducing
colonic high-amplitude propagated contractions.
• Melanosis coli indicates recent laxative use. The evidence linking anthraquinones to colon cancer and
destruction of the myenteric plexus is inconclusive.
Both of the secretagogues (ie, lubiprostone and linaclotide)
used to treat chronic constipation increase intestinal secretion
of chloride, which is followed by the secretion of water
into the lumen. Lubiprostone has been approved by the US
Food and Drug Administration. Lubiprostone is a bicyclic
fatty acid derivative that promotes intestinal secretion by activating intestinal chloride channels (ie, CIC-2 channels).
Lubiprostone accelerates colonic transit in healthy subjects
and improves symptoms in chronic constipation and
constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome. The
effects of lubiprostone are more pronounced on stool consistency and frequency than on abdominal bloating, discomfort,
and straining. Lubiprostone is well tolerated; nausea and headache are the most common adverse effects. In clinical trials,
33% of patients reported nausea, which generally was mild
and could be reduced by taking the medication with meals.
• Lubiprostone stimulates intestinal secretion by activating chloride channels; it also improves stool consistency
and relieves constipation.

223

Linaclotide, which is a ﬁrst-in-class 14 amino acid peptide
similar to the heat-stable enterotoxins (ST peptides) of
Escherichia coli that cause traveler’s diarrhea, is emerging as a
promising agent for treating chronic constipation. It is a guanylate cyclase-C receptor agonist that increases the synthesis
of cyclic guanosine monophosphate that in turn induces signaling pathways which stimulate chloride and bicarbonate
secretion through CFTR channel-dependent and, to a lesser
extent, channel-independent mechanisms. Linaclotide also
acts on a sodium proton exchanger to inhibit the absorption
of sodium from the lumen. Phase 2 studies of up to 4 weeks’
duration showed that linaclotide improved symptoms and
accelerated colonic transit.
Newer serotoninergic 5-HT4 agonists (eg, prucalopride)
are more speciﬁc for 5-HT4 receptors and have fewer cardiovascular effects than older 5-HT4 agonists (eg, cisapride). They
accelerate colonic transit in healthy subjects and, for some
agonists, also in subjects with chronic constipation. They also
improve symptoms of chronic constipation. However, these
agents are not approved for clinical use in the United States.
Other pharmacologic approaches that have been used to
manage constipation include colchicine and misoprostol
(Cytotec). Colchicine, 0.6 mg orally 3 times daily, and misoprostol, 1,200 mg daily, cause diarrhea. Colchicine should be
used cautiously, if at all, for treating constipation, because
long-term use may be associated with neuromyopathy. Other
adverse effects include hypersensitivity reactions, bone marrow
suppression, and renal damage. Misoprostol should not be
used to treat constipation because it is expensive, may cause
miscarriage in pregnant women, and may exacerbate abdominal bloating. Moreover, its beneﬁcial effects appear to decrease
with time.
• Colchicine and misoprostol are unproven, potentially
deleterious agents for treating slow-transit constipation.
Enemas, including mineral oil retention enema, 100 to
250 mL daily per rectum; phosphate enema (Fleet), 1 unit per
rectum; tap water enema, 500 mL per rectum; and soapsuds
enema, 1,500 mL per rectum, are especially useful in patients
with fecal impaction in the rectosigmoid colon, as may occur
in obstructive defecation. All the preparations are contraindicated for patients with rectal inﬂammation, and phosphate
enemas are contraindicated for patients with hyperphosphatemia or hypernatremia. Mineral oil taken orally is associated with lipid pneumonia, malabsorption of fat-soluble
vitamins, dehydration, and fecal incontinence.
• Enemas may be used judiciously on an as-needed basis
for constipation.
Surgical Therapy

Subtotal colectomy with ileorectal anastomosis is effective and
occasionally indicated for patients with medically refractory
severe slow-transit constipation, provided that pelvic ﬂoor
dysfunction has been excluded or treated. In patients with
megarectum, the rectum is also resected. Postoperative ileus

224

Section V Colon

and delayed mechanical small-bowel obstruction each occur
in approximately 10% of patients. Diarrhea is common shortly
after the operation but tends to resolve with time. The importance of identifying and treating pelvic ﬂoor dysfunction with
biofeedback therapy preoperatively in patients with slowtransit constipation cannot be overemphasized.
• Subtotal colectomy is necessary and beneﬁcial for
patients with slow-transit constipation who do not have
a response to medical management.

Disorders of Pelvic Floor Function

Disorders of pelvic ﬂoor function include functional defecatory disorders and fecal incontinence. Fecal incontinence, or
involuntary leakage of stool from the anus, is a common
symptom, particularly in the elderly. In community-based
surveys, the prevalence of fecal incontinence among women
50 years or older approaches 15%. The prevalence among
nursing home residents is as high as 40%. The prevalence of
functional defecatory disorders in the community is unknown.
At Mayo Clinic, 50% of patients with chronic constipation
had a component of pelvic ﬂoor dysfunction.
Physiology of Defecation

Rectal distention evokes the desire to defecate and induces
relaxation of the internal anal sphincter by an involuntary
reﬂex (Fig. 20.2). Defecation is completed by adoption of a
suitable posture, contraction of the diaphragm and abdominal
muscles to increase intra-abdominal pressure, and relaxation
of the puborectalis muscle and external anal sphincter, both
striated muscles. Relaxation of the puborectalis muscle allows

Colonic HAPC

widening and lowering of the anorectal angle, with perineal
descent (Fig. 20.3). The coordination between abdominal
contraction and pelvic ﬂoor relaxation is crucial to the process. Although colonic high-amplitude propagated contractions may precede defecation, the contribution of rectal
contraction to defecation is unclear.
Functional Defecatory Disorders

Functional defecatory disorders (also called obstructive defecation, pelvic ﬂoor dyssynergia, and pelvic ﬂoor dysfunction) are
characterized by disordered defecation caused by functional
obstruction that results from impaired relaxation of the external anal sphincter, impaired relaxation of the puborectalis
muscle, or inadequate propulsive forces (ie, intrarectal pressure), or some combination of these. Although certain symptoms are considered suggestive of obstructive defecation (eg,
frequent straining, a sensation of incomplete evacuation, dyschezia, and digital evacuation of feces), symptoms alone are
not sufﬁciently speciﬁc for distinguishing between functional
defecatory disorders and other causes of constipation (ie, normal-transit and slow-transit constipation). A thorough digital
rectal examination with assessment of anal resting tone and
anorectal motion when subjects contract (ie, squeeze) and
simulate evacuation is useful for identifying defecatory disorders. Anal resting pressure is gauged by the resistance to the
insertion of a ﬁnger in the anal canal. When patients squeeze,
the anal sphincter and puborectalis muscles contract; the latter
lifts the palpating ﬁnger toward the umbilicus. Conversely,
simulated evacuation should be accompanied by perineal
descent (2–4 cm) and relaxation of the puborectalis muscle. In
patients with functional defecatory disorders, digital rectal
examination may show increased resting pressure and/or

increased or decreased perineal descent. When rectal prolapse
is suspected, patients should be examined in the seated position on a commode.
Tests

Anorectal tests are necessary because defecatory disorders
cannot be identiﬁed by clinical features alone. Anorectal
manometry and rectal balloon expulsion tests usually are sufﬁcient to conﬁrm or exclude functional defecatory disorders.

Normal

In selected patients, defecography with barium or magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) may be necessary.
Anorectal manometry—This test may indicate a high resting anal sphincter pressure (>90 mm Hg) or a reduced rectoanal pressure gradient (or both) during simulated defecation
(Fig. 20.4). Normal values for anal pressures measured with
manometry are technique-dependent and inﬂuenced by
age, sex, and perhaps parity. Anal pressures are lower in
women than in men and decrease with age, even in asymptomatic subjects.

226

Section V Colon

Rectal balloon expulsion test—Rectal expulsion can be
evaluated by asking patients to expel from the rectum balloons
ﬁlled with water or air. One approach is to measure the time
required to expel a rectal balloon while the patient is seated on
a commode chair behind a privacy screen. Depending on the
technique, subjects with normal pelvic ﬂoor functions can
expel a rectal balloon within 3 to 5 minutes. An alternative
method is to measure, with the patient in the left lateral decubitus position, the traction required to expel a balloon connected over a pulley to a series of weights. Patients with pelvic
ﬂoor dysfunction require more external traction to expel a
balloon (Fig. 20.5). The rectal balloon expulsion test is highly
sensitive and speciﬁc (>85%) for identifying functional defecatory disorders. Moreover, an abnormal result on the rectal
balloon expulsion test predicts the response to pelvic ﬂoor
retraining by biofeedback therapy.
Barium or magnetic resonance (MR) proctography—
During dynamic (ie, barium or MR) proctography, anorectal
anatomy and pelvic ﬂoor motion are recorded with the patient
at rest, coughing, squeezing, and straining to expel barium
from the rectum. The anorectal angle and position of the anorectal junction are tracked during these maneuvers, as are the
retention and evacuation of contrast material. Dynamic imaging can identify inadequate or excessive perineal descent,
internal rectal intussusception, rectoceles, sigmoidoceles, and
enteroceles. Also, puborectalis muscle dysfunction can be
characterized during squeeze and evacuation. MR proctography is preferred to barium proctography because 1) it does not
entail radiation exposure, 2) it is easier to visualize the bladder
and uterus together with the anorectum, and 3) the bony
landmarks (pubis and sacrococcygeal junction) necessary to
measure anorectal descent are visualized more distinctly
during MRI. Therefore, measurements of anorectal motion
are more reproducible with MR proctography than with
barium proctography. However, proctography ﬁndings need
to be interpreted in the overall clinical context. For example,

Balloon

rectoceles are particularly common in multiparous subjects.
Clinically important rectoceles are generally large (>3 cm) or
fail to empty completely during defecation. Moreover, women
with clinically important rectoceles often apply posterior vaginal pressure to facilitate defecation. Rectoceles usually are due
to inadequate pelvic ﬂoor relaxation rather than to the primary abnormality.
Colonic transit—Up to 70% of patients with pelvic ﬂoor
dysfunction have delayed colonic transit. Thus, the ﬁnding of
slow colonic transit does not exclude the diagnosis of obstructive defecation.
• Anorectal manometry and the rectal balloon expulsion
test generally are sufﬁcient for diagnosing functional
defecatory disorders; proctography is necessary in
selected cases only.
• The rectal balloon expulsion test is highly sensitive and
speciﬁc for diagnosing functional defecatory disorders,
and an abnormal test result predicts the response to
biofeedback therapy.
• Colonic transit is delayed in the majority of patients
who have functional defecatory disorders.
• Because false-positive and false-negative results may
occur, anorectal function tests need to be interpreted in
the context of the clinical features. For example, in up to
20% of healthy controls, the anal sphincter paradoxically contracts instead of relaxes during evacuation.
Treatment

Pelvic ﬂoor retraining with biofeedback therapy improves
symptoms in 70% of patients who have a functional defecatory disorder. Biofeedback therapy is conducted with sensors
that measure surface electromyographic activity or pressures
in the anorectum. By providing auditory or visual feedback of
this activity, patients are taught to relax the pelvic ﬂoor and
improve coordination between abdominal wall and diaphragmatic contraction and pelvic relaxation during defecation.
Measures to contract the pelvic ﬂoor muscle (eg, Kegel’s exercises) are not appropriate for obstructive defecation. Strong
rapport between patients and therapists is critical for biofeedback therapy. Controlled trials have shown that pelvic ﬂoor
retraining is superior to laxatives for relieving constipation in
patients with obstructive defecation. This symptomatic
improvement has been sustained for 2 years. Biofeedback
therapy also normalizes colonic transit and anal relaxation
during defecation.

Fecal continence is maintained by anatomical factors and
complex sensory and motor interactions among the sphincters, the anorectum, central and peripheral awareness, and the
physical ability to get to a toilet. Fecal incontinence is deﬁned as
the involuntary leakage of liquid or solid stool from the anus;
anal incontinence also includes leakage of gas. Up to 40% of

20 Constipation and Disorders of Pelvic Floor Function

nursing home residents have fecal incontinence, which is also
common in the community. Up to 1 in 10 of all women and 1
in 5 women 40 years and older in the community have fecal
incontinence. Patients with chronic fecal incontinence lead a
restricted lifestyle, are afraid of having an embarrassing episode, and often miss work. The symptom frequently coexists
with urinary incontinence and contributes to institutionalization. People with fecal incontinence are embarrassed to admit
to their family and physician that they have this condition,
even though their symptoms may affect quality of life signiﬁcantly. Therefore, it is essential to ask patients with diarrhea or
diabetes mellitus whether they have incontinence.
Etiology

In most patients, fecal incontinence is attributable to disordered anorectal continence mechanisms compounded by
bowel disturbances, generally diarrhea. Important diseases
that contribute to fecal incontinence include the following:
Sphincter damage—This includes obstetric and surgical
(eg, hemorrhoidectomy) damage. Known obstetric risk factors for sphincter damage include forceps delivery, median
episiotomy, and high birth weight.
Pudendal neuropathy—This may be attributable to obstetric trauma or diabetes mellitus. Also, patients with constipation may strain excessively during defecation and cause stretch
injury to the pudendal nerve, soft tissue laxity, and excessive
perineal descent. Eventually, sphincter weakness develops,
predisposing to fecal incontinence.
Neurologic causes—These include multiple sclerosis,
Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease, stroke, diabetic neuropathy, and cauda equina or conus medullaris lesions. Cauda
equina lesions that cause fecal incontinence usually are accompanied by other neurologic symptoms and signs.
Other local causes—Examples are perianal sepsis, radiation
proctitis, and systemic sclerosis. In radiation proctitis, the
entry of stool into a noncompliant (stiff) rectum may overwhelm continence mechanisms and cause incontinence.
Scleroderma is associated with ﬁbrosis of the internal anal
sphincter and weak resting pressures.
Diarrhea—Fecal incontinence is a common complication
of irritable bowel syndrome, cholecystectomy, and inﬂammatory bowel disease.
Assessment

Patients with diarrhea must be asked speciﬁcally about fecal
incontinence because they may not volunteer the information.
The severity, risk factors, and circumstances of fecal incontinence and its effect on lifestyle should be assessed. Patients
with urge incontinence generally are incontinent only for
liquid or semiformed stools, have a brief warning time, and
are unable to reach the toilet in time. In contrast, patients with
passive incontinence are aware of stool leakage only after the
episode. Patients with urge incontinence have decreased anal
squeeze pressure or squeeze duration (or both), whereas those

227

with passive incontinence have reduced anal resting pressure.
Some patients with urge fecal incontinence also may have
rectal hypersensitivity, perhaps from a stiffer rectum.
Nocturnal fecal incontinence occurs in patients with diabetes
mellitus or scleroderma and is suggestive of weakness of the
internal anal sphincter. A complete physical examination
should include perianal assessment to identify common causes
of perianal soiling, such as hemorrhoidal prolapse, perianal
ﬁstula, rectal mucosal prolapse, fecal impaction, anal stricture,
and rectal mass. The perianal area must be inspected closely,
both with the patient in the left lateral decubitus position and
seated on the toilet. A thorough digital examination, as
described above, should be performed. Flexible sigmoidoscopy, with or without anoscopy, is the ﬁnal component in this
phase of evaluation.
Tests

A combination of tests is necessary to evaluate the various
components of anorectal anatomy and function. For each
patient, the intensity of investigation depends on the patient’s
age, severity of fecal incontinence, clinical assessment of risk
factors and anal sphincter pressures, and response to previous
therapy (Fig. 20.6).
Anorectal manometry—Frequently, anal resting and
squeeze pressures are decreased in fecal incontinence. Anal
pressures should be compared with normal values obtained
with the same technique in age- and sex-matched asymptomatic subjects. Among patients with weak or normal anal
pressures, other factors (eg, diarrhea or disturbances of
rectal compliance or sensation) also may contribute to fecal
incontinence.
Anal ultrasonography—This reliably identiﬁes anatomical
defects or thinning of the internal anal sphincter and defects
of the external anal sphincter that often are unrecognized clinically or amenable to surgical repair (or both). However,
compared with the interpretation of images of the internal
sphincter, the interpretation of images of the external anal
sphincter is more subjective, operator-dependent, and confounded by normal anatomical variations of the external anal
sphincter. Results of prospective studies have suggested that
up to one-third of women develop an external anal sphincter
defect after a vaginal delivery. Therefore, it can be challenging
to interpret the clinical signiﬁcance of anal sphincter defects,
that is, the extent to which a sphincter defect explains anal
weakness.
Evacuation proctography—Dynamic proctography is indicated for fecal incontinence when clinical features suggest
excessive perineal descent, a signiﬁcant rectocele (eg, in
patients who splint the vagina to facilitate rectal emptying), an
enterocele, or internal rectal intussusception.
Sphincter denervation measurements—The pudendal
nerve may be injured (with or without damaging the sphincter) during vaginal delivery or by repetitive straining in
patients with chronic constipation. Pudendal nerve terminal
motor latency (PNTML) can be measured by placing the

examining ﬁnger, covered by a glove containing stimulating
and recording electrodes, as close as possible to the pudendal
nerve as it courses around the pelvic brim. PNTML measures
the function of the fastest conducting ﬁbers. Initial studies
showed prolonged PNTML in fecal incontinence. However,
PNTML measurements are operator-dependent and lack adequate sensitivity and speciﬁcity for identifying pudendal nerve
damage. Patients with prolonged PNTML may have normal
anal canal squeeze pressures. In contrast to earlier studies,
recent data have suggested that prolonged PNTML does not
predict success after surgical repair of sphincter defects.
According to a position statement from the American
Gastroenterological Association, PNTML should not be used
to evaluate fecal incontinence. Needle electromyographic
examination of the external anal sphincter provides a sensitive
measure of denervation and usually can identify myopathic,
neurogenic, or mixed injury.
Rectal compliance and sensation—Sensation is assessed by
asking subjects to report when they perceive the ﬁrst detectable sensation, the desire to defecate (or urgency), and maximal tolerable discomfort during rectal balloon distention,
generally with a handheld syringe. Alternatively, a balloon can
be inﬂated at a controlled rate with a barostat, which is a continuous-infusion pump. During distention with a barostat,
rectal pressures and volumes and, thus, rectal compliance
(pressure-volume relationships) and capacity also can be
assessed. Rectal sensation may be normal, decreased, or
increased in fecal incontinence. When rectal sensation is
decreased, stool may leak before the external anal sphincter
contracts. By improving rectal sensation, sensory retraining

can restore the coordinated contraction of the external anal
sphincter and improve fecal continence. Conversely, other
patients with fecal incontinence have exaggerated rectal sensation, perhaps because of a stiffer or smaller rectum.
Pelvic MRI—MRI is a relatively new method for imaging
anal sphincter anatomy and pelvic ﬂoor motion during defecation and squeeze without radiation exposure. The anal
sphincters also can be visualized, preferably with an endoanal
MRI coil. MRI is superior to ultrasonography for visualizing
morphologic features, particularly atrophy, of the external
anal sphincter. In contrast to evacuation proctography,
dynamic MRI does not entail radiation exposure and it directly
visualizes the pelvic ﬂoor, including the anterior (bladder)
and middle (uterus) compartments.
Treatment

Much can be accomplished by regulating bowel habits in
patients with diarrhea or constipation. Diarrhea should be
managed by treatment of the underlying condition (eg, antibiotics for small intestinal bacterial overgrowth and dietary
restriction for carbohydrate malabsorption) or with antidiarrheal agents, which must be prescribed in adequate doses.
Loperamide hydrochloride (4 mg; maximal dose, 16 mg/day),
diphenoxylate hydrochloride with atropine sulfate (5 mg), or
codeine sulfate (30–60 mg) may need to be taken regularly,
preferably 30 minutes before meals, perhaps up to several
times daily. Loperamide not only delays gastrointestinal transit but also improves anal resting tone. Similarly, amitryptyline
improves fecal continence by restoring stool consistency and

20 Constipation and Disorders of Pelvic Floor Function

reducing rectal irritability. The bile-acid binding resin
cholestyramine is useful for patients with postcholecystectomy
diarrhea. Scheduled rectal emptying with suppositories
or enemas is often useful for fecal impaction and overﬂow
incontinence.
The results of uncontrolled studies have suggested that biofeedback therapy improves symptoms in up to 70% of patients
with fecal incontinence, particularly those with partially preserved rectal sensation. In a controlled trial, 171 patients with
fecal incontinence were assigned randomly to four groups:
standard medical and nursing care (advice only), advice and
verbal instruction on sphincter exercises, hospital-based
computer-assisted sphincter pressure biofeedback, or hospital
biofeedback and use of a home electromyographic biofeedback device. Overall, 55% of patients reported improved
symptoms and 5% were cured. Improvement was sustained at
1 year after therapy, and symptoms and resting and squeeze
pressures improved to a similar degree in all four groups.
These results underscore the importance that patients attach
to understanding the condition, to practical advice about
coping strategies (eg, diet and skin care), and to nurse-patient
interaction. However, the usefulness of biofeedback therapy
over and above that of other conservative measures was
unclear. This question was assessed by another controlled trial
of 108 patients, in which 22% had a response to 4 weeks of
conservative therapy. Among the other 65 patients who did
not respond and continued with the study, the response rates
were better for those who received 6 biweekly sessions with
electromyographic-assisted biofeedback and pelvic ﬂoor exercises (77% reported adequate relief and 66% were completely
continent) than for those who had pelvic ﬂoor exercises alone
(41% reported adequate relief and 48% were completely continent). These preliminary data support the use of biofeedback
therapy for patients with fecal incontinence that does not
respond to other conservative measures. Poor prognostic factors include total absence of rectal sensation, dementia,
sphincter denervation, and megarectum. Success is highly
dependent on the motivation of the patient and the rapport
between the patient and therapist.
Continence improves in 80% to 90% of patients shortly
after repair of anal sphincter defects but deteriorates over time
thereafter; less than 20% of patients are continent at 5 years
after the operation. Artiﬁcial anal sphincter and dynamic
graciloplasty are associated with considerable morbidity, particularly wound infections, and are used sparingly in the

229

United States. Colostomy is often the last resort for patients
with medically refractory fecal incontinence. Several uncontrolled studies have suggested that sacral nerve stimulation
may improve fecal continence, particularly in patients who
have normal sphincter anatomy. Sacral nerve stimulation is
approved for treating urinary symptoms but, pending completion of a controlled trial, not for fecal incontinence.
• Conservative measures, including management of bowel
disturbances, often can improve fecal continence.
• Patients who do not beneﬁt from conservative measures
alone may beneﬁt from pelvic ﬂoor retraining.
• Fecal continence improves in the short term but deteriorates over time after surgical repair of anal sphincter
defects.

Gastrointestinal Disease and Pregnancya
Sunanda V. Kane, MD

Pharmacotherapy for the management of common gastrointestinal illnesses has evolved remarkably in the last 10 years.
Women with chronic illnesses who would have been unwilling
or unable to conceive in the past are now healthy enough to
consider pregnancy. In addition, many women are deferring
childbearing until later in life, when polypharmacy and illness
may be more common. This chapter discusses the use of
medications during pregnancy, based on the best available
evidence. Because the amount of high-quality controlled
data in pregnancy is limited, absolute safety is not guaranteed
for any medication. Instead, the risk of the underlying
condition versus the safety of the medications used to treat it
should be balanced against the overall health of the mother
and the fetus in each case. All conversations about medications should be documented carefully, along with possible
consequences of not treating the disease during pregnancy.
Communication with the patient’s obstetrician during this
time is also paramount.a

This chapter covers the treatment of common gastrointestinal and liver diseases, the management of common gastrointestinal symptoms, and the use of medications during
endoscopy. The majority of medications can be categorized on
the basis of existing reports; the medications are summarized
in Table 21.1.

Endoscopy

Endoscopy constitutes a large portion of the gastroenterologist’s role in patient care. Although many pregnant women
have appropriate indications for endoscopy, fetal drug safety

Deﬁnition

A

Controlled studies in animals and women have
shown no risk in the ﬁrst trimester, and possible
fetal harm is remote.
Either animal studies have not demonstrated a fetal
risk but there are no controlled studies in
pregnant women, or animal studies have shown
an adverse effect that was not conﬁrmed in
controlled studies in women in the ﬁrst trimester.
No controlled studies in humans have been
performed, and animal studies have shown
adverse events, or studies in humans and animals
are not available; give medication if potential
beneﬁt outweighs the risk.
Positive evidence of fetal risk is available, but the
beneﬁts may outweigh the risk if life-threatening
or serious disease.
Studies in animals or humans show fetal
abnormalities; drug contraindicated.

is a major consideration in the choice and dosage of endoscopic medications. For particularly high-risk endoscopy such
as therapeutic endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), an anesthesiologist may be helpful in titration of
medications and patient monitoring. For patients who present
with gastrointestinal tract hemorrhage, in which diagnosis
and therapeutic intervention are necessary, therapeutic scopes
should be used. The use of medications for endoscopy is summarized in Table 21.2.

prior to the labor period, unless in the judgment of the physician the potential beneﬁts outweigh the possible hazards,
because safe use in pregnancy prior to labor has not been
established relative to possible effects on fetal development.”
Meperidine is preferred to diazepam or midazolam as an
endoscopic premedication during pregnancy. Meperidine
dosage should be titrated to produce calmness, restfulness,
and mild analgesia without somnolence.
Fentanyl

Meperidine

Meperidine is transferred rapidly across the placenta.
Physicians have extensive experience prescribing meperidine
during pregnancy, particularly during labor. Two large studies
did not show teratogenicity from the administration of meperidine during the ﬁrst trimester. The Collaborative Perinatal
Project, a national study with the primary aim of documenting the teratogenicity of drugs taken during the ﬁrst 4 months
of pregnancy, followed more than 50,000 women in 12 US
centers between 1959 and 1965 and reported no teratogenicity
from meperidine use in 268 mothers with ﬁrst-trimester exposure. Meperidine is preferred to morphine for obstetric pain
because it is slower to cross the fetal blood-brain barrier.
Meperidine can cause diminished fetal beat-to-beat cardiac
variability that lasts for approximately 1 hour after being
administered intravenously to the mother and is a common
cause of decreased fetal cardiac variability during endoscopy.
The labeling approved by the US Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) for meperidine carries the following
warning: “Meperidine should not be used in pregnant women

Fentanyl is rated a category C drug during pregnancy, and
accumulated anecdotal experience suggests that it may be used
in low doses for endoscopy. Fentanyl is sometimes used as an
alternative to meperidine during endoscopy because of its
more rapid onset of action. In several human studies, administration of fentanyl to the mother during labor produced no
neonatal toxicity.
Propofol

Propofol is a category B drug and is now a preferred agent for
sedation in some endoscopy centers. However, it has not been
studied extensively in women in the ﬁrst and second trimesters and, thus, is not recommended for use during this time,
based on the dearth of studies in the obstetrical literature.
Propofol rapidly transfers across the placenta near term. In
one study, 20 infants exposed to propofol during parturition
had depressed Apgar scores at birth compared with unexposed
controls, but the neurodepression rapidly reversed. Numerous
other studies have failed to demonstrate any neonatal toxicity

21 Gastrointestinal Disease and Pregnancy

when propofol was administered during parturition; however,
the safety of exposure in the ﬁrst trimester has not been
studied adequately.
Naloxone

The FDA classiﬁes naloxone as a category B drug during pregnancy. In subjects who are opiate-dependent, small doses of
naloxone precipitate a syndrome resembling that produced by
opiate withdrawal. Symptoms include restlessness, anxiety,
insomnia, irritability, hyperalgesia, nausea, and muscle cramps.
Because opiates cross the placenta, the administration of naloxone is dangerous and contraindicated in a pregnant patient
who is speciﬁcally opiate dependent. The FDA-approved labeling for naloxone has the following precaution about use during
pregnancy: “Naloxone should be used in pregnancy only if
clearly needed.” The administration of naloxone is appropriate, however, for pregnant patients who have serious signs of
potential meperidine toxicity, such as respiratory depression,
systemic hypotension, or unresponsiveness.

233

Flumazenil

Flumazenil, a category C drug, is a benzodiazepine antagonist
that rapidly reverses the central effects of benzodiazepines.
Little is known about the safety of ﬂumazenil during pregnancy or in infants; thus, it should be used during pregnancy
only if the potential beneﬁt clearly outweighs the risks. The
need for ﬂumazenil can be prevented by careful and slow titration of benzodiazepine dosage and by using the minimal benzodiazepine dosage required for endoscopic examination.
Simethicone

The FDA has classiﬁed this agent as a category C drug. Many
endoscopists use simethicone to reduce gastric foam before
upper endoscopy. The Michigan Medicaid Study failed to
show a statistically signiﬁcant difference between pregnant
women exposed to the drug and those not exposed to it.
Simethicone use is low risk during endoscopy because it is not
absorbed systemically.

Benzodiazepines

Glucagon

Diazepam and midazolam, category D drugs, should have
restricted use during endoscopy, particularly during the ﬁrst
trimester. Benzodiazepines, including diazepam and midazolam, are commonly administered before gastrointestinal
endoscopy to reduce anxiety, induce brief amnesia, and produce muscle relaxation. Diazepam freely and rapidly crosses
the placenta and accumulates in the fetal circulation at levels
equal to or higher than those of maternal serum. The FDAapproved labeling for diazepam carries the following warning
about use in pregnancy: “An increased risk of congenital malformations associated with the use of minor tranquilizers
during the ﬁrst trimester of pregnancy has been suggested in
several studies. Because use of these drugs is rarely a matter of
urgency, their use during this period should almost always be
avoided.” Diazepam is not recommended by the American
Academy of Pediatrics because it, along with its metabolite
N-demethyldiazepam, can accumulate in breast-fed infants.
Many endoscopists prefer midazolam to diazepam for
endoscopic premedication because of faster onset and recovery time, more intense transient antegrade amnesia, and lower
risk of thrombophlebitis. Midazolam crosses the human placenta, but fetal serum levels increase to only about one-third
to two-thirds of those of maternal serum after oral, intramuscular, or intravenous administration in the mother. Midazolam
appears to be preferable to diazepam for endoscopy during
pregnancy because of the potential association between diazepam and oral clefts and neonatal neurobehavioral abnormalities. Because the mechanism of action is similar to that of
diazepam, midazolam should be used cautiously and in low
doses during pregnancy, particularly during the ﬁrst trimester.
Dosages should be titrated carefully to an end point of relaxation and calmness but not somnolence.

The FDA classiﬁes glucagon as a category B drug during pregnancy. However, no adequate and well-controlled studies have
involved pregnant women. Thus, this drug should be used
during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Although fetal risk
has not been characterized completely, the administration of
glucagon appears to be justiﬁed to decrease motility to help
reduce procedure time and aid in cannulation of the bile duct
and sphincterotomy during therapeutic ERCP, performed
because of the high risk of untreated maternal cholangitis. The
grounding pad should be positioned so that the uterus is not
directly between the electrical catheter and grounding pad.
Antibiotics

Ampicillin: The FDA classiﬁes ampicillin as a category B drug
during pregnancy. The American Heart Association recommends ampicillin as intravenous antibiotic prophylaxis for
patients at high and medium risk of endocarditis (ie, artiﬁcial
heart valves and certain congenital heart defects) who undergo
ERCP in the presence of biliary obstruction. Ampicillin, a
penicillin antibiotic, rapidly crosses the placenta, and fetal
serum levels equilibrate with those of maternal serum within
3 hours after the drug is administered to the mother.
Gentamicin: This FDA category C drug is recommended by
the American Heart Association as part of a prophylactic antibiotic regimen for patients at high and medium risk of endocarditis who undergo ERCP in the presence of biliary
obstruction. Gentamicin, an aminoglycoside antibiotic, rapidly crosses the placenta, and fetal serum levels peak at about
one-half those of maternal levels after administration.
However, the drug should be administered if required to treat
known biliary sepsis.

234

clinical setting, the risk of maternal cholangitis will likely outweigh the theoretical risk of transient fetal hypothyroidism.

Polyethylene glycol electrolyte solution has not been studied
extensively in pregnancy, and it is not known whether it can
cause fetal harm. A study of 225 patients demonstrated the
agent was safe when used to treat constipation. Because full
colonoscopy rarely is indicated during pregnancy, tap water
enemas are recommended as bowel preparation for lower
endoscopy.
Lidocaine

Lidocaine, an FDA category B drug, often is applied topically to
the oropharynx before upper endoscopy and ERCP. No fetal
harm was noted during parturition in the Collaborative
Perinatal Project, in which 293 infants were exposed in the ﬁrst
trimester. The pregnant patient who is administered topical
lidocaine should be instructed to gargle and spit out, rather than
swallow, the preparation to minimize systemic absorption.
Therapeutic Agents for Hemostasis

Epinephrine is injected during endoscopy to achieve hemostasis of actively bleeding lesions. During therapeutic endoscopy,
it is used to stop active bleeding, and in this clinical scenario,
the beneﬁt outweighs the potential risk of its use.
Electricity is transferred readily across the uterus because
amniotic ﬂuid is an excellent conductor. Fetal risk depends on
the voltage and current amplitude, duration, and frequency
time as well as the location on the body. Fetal mortality is rare
from electroconvulsive therapy or direct current cardioversion during pregnancy. During endoscopy, cap electrocautery
should be used because no grounding pad is necessary.
Contrast Dye

Diatrizoate, a contrast agent injected into the biliary tree, has
been used in diagnostic and therapeutic amniography without
harming the fetus. Although it has been documented to impair
fetal thyroid function and is categorized as a class D medication, the risk of its use for cholangiography is less than for
amniography because of the doses used. In the appropriate

Nausea and Vomiting

Nausea and vomiting are extremely common during pregnancy and have multiple causes. Most women can be supported through episodes without the use of antiemetics.
However, for women who have a protracted course or underlying conditions that may predispose to nausea and vomiting,
medical therapy is warranted to prevent complications from
volume depletion. The use of antiemetic medications during
pregnancy is summarized in Table 21.3.
Metoclopramide

The use of metoclopramide as an antiemetic usually is conﬁned to the ﬁrst trimester, but it also is used to enhance gastric
emptying throughout pregnancy. A Danish study compared,
over a 5-year period, 309 women with singleton pregnancies
and prescriptions for metoclopramide with 13,327 controls
and reported no major differences in the risk for malformations (odds ratio [OR] 1.11, 0.6–2.1), low birth weight (OR
1.79, 0.8–3.9), or preterm delivery (OR 1.02, 0.6–1.7).
Prochlorperazine

Prochlorperazine, a category C drug, readily crosses the placenta. However, most studies have not found an increased risk
of adverse outcomes in pregnancy.
Promethazine

Promethazine is also a category C drug. It is an antihistamine
that is used occasionally as an antiemetic during pregnancy
and also as adjunctive therapy for narcotics during labor.
Trimethobenzamide

Trimethobenzamide is a category C drug. Three studies have
followed outcomes in women who took trimethobenzamide

Ondansetron, a category B drug, is used for the prevention

and for hyperemesis gravidarum. A randomized, double-blind
study compared intravenous ondansetron with promethazine
for hyperemesis. Ondansetron was well tolerated and efﬁcacious with no adverse effects; however, infant outcomes were

in major malformations in comparison with exposure to other
antiemetics or normal controls.

Both of these agents are category B drugs. There have not been

Domperidone, a category C drug, is a dopamine antagonist
used for short-term treatment of nausea and vomiting and
for its prokinetic properties. Currently, it is not available in
the United States by prescription. Whether it crosses the placenta is not known, but its bioavailability after oral ingestion
is low.

Gastroesophageal Reﬂux Disease

Heartburn is estimated to occur in 30% to 50% of pregnancies.
For mild symptoms, only lifestyle and dietary modiﬁcations
may be required. Medications for treating gastroesophageal
reﬂux disease have not been tested routinely in randomized,
controlled trials in pregnant women. The medications used to
treat gastroesophageal reﬂux disease and peptic ulcer disease
are summarized in Table 21.4.

Antacids

Antacids that contain magnesium, aluminum, or calcium are
not teratogenic in animal studies. Although one case-control
study reported a signiﬁcant increase in major and minor congenital abnormalities in infants exposed to antacids during the
ﬁrst trimester of pregnancy, no analysis of individual agents
was done and, currently, most antacids at normal therapeutic
doses are considered acceptable during pregnancy. Magnesium
trisilicate, found in alginic acid, can lead to fetal nephrolithiasis, hypotonia, and respiratory distress if used long term and
in high doses. Antacids containing sodium bicarbonate should
not be used because they can cause maternal or fetal metabolic
alkalosis and ﬂuid overload. Excessive intake of calcium carbonate can result in milk-alkali syndrome, characterized by
hypercalcemia, renal impairment, and metabolic alkalosis.
None of the antacids have been shown to concentrate in breast
milk and are acceptable when nursing.

dose, reported more abortions, lower fetal weight, and fewer
live fetuses than controls. Another study showed a higher rate
of abortions in rabbits treated with large doses of the drug.
Promotility Agents
Metoclopramide

Metoclopramide is a category B drug. No congenital malformations or other neonatal toxicities have been reported in
humans with the use of metoclopramide. Reproductive studies in mice, rats, and rabbits that received up to 250 times the
recommended human dose have not demonstrated any
increase in fetal toxicity. Metoclopramide has been used as a
lactation stimulant, and the total daily dose that would be
consumed by a nursing infant if the mother took 30 mg/day is
much less than the maximum daily dose of 500 μg/kg recommend for infants. Therefore, maternal doses of 45 mg or less
per day should not have adverse effects on a nursing infant.

Sucralfate
Cisapride

Sucralfate, a category B drug, is a nonabsorbable drug that
exerts a local rather than systemic effect and has been tested in
a prospective randomized controlled trial. Women with gastroesophageal reﬂux disease treated with sucralfate had a
higher frequency of symptomatic remission than controls
(90% vs 43%, P<.05).
Cimetidine

Cimetidine is a category B drug. Multiple large cohort studies
have shown that the rate of major birth defects among pregnant women taking cimetidine is the same as that for healthy
controls.
Ranitidine

Ranitidine, like the other histamine2 (H2) blockers, is a category B drug. In the most recently published study of ranitidine
use during pregnancy, data were collected prospectively from
a large network database for teratology information. The study
reported on 335 pregnancies exposed to ranitidine, 113 to
cimetidine, 75 to famotidine, and 15 to nizatidine. The incidence of premature deliveries was higher in the exposed group
than the control group, but there was no increase in the incidence of major malformations. The authors concluded that
there was no indication of an increased risk for major malformations after the use of H2 blockers during pregnancy.
Famotidine and Nizatidine

Although both famotidine and nizatidine are category B drugs,
the relatively smaller amount of data available from animal
and human studies compared with that for other H2 blockers
makes the choice of another agent prudent. Studies of animals
treated with nizatidine, 300 times the recommended human

Cisapride is a category C drug. A prospective, multicenter
study compared the outcomes of 129 Canadian women who
took cisapride between November 1996 and November 1998
with those of matched controls. No differences in the rates of
major or minor congenital malformations were reported for
the two groups. In July 2000, Janssen removed cisapride from
the market because of concern about cardiovascular effects,
and it is available only through a limited-access program.
Omeprazole

Omeprazole, the ﬁrst proton pump inhibitor, is a category C
drug. This drug has been shown to produce dose-related
embryonic and fetal mortality in pregnant rats and rabbits
administered doses similar to those for humans. However,
several prospective database studies have shown the safety of
omeprazole. The incidence of major abnormalities in pregnant
women exposed to omeprazole was 5.1%, compared with 3.1%
for those taking H2 blockers and 3.0% for the untreated group.
Because of the paucity of data about their effects, proton pump
inhibitors are not recommended for nursing mothers.
Lansoprazole

Lansoprazole is a category B drug. In one nonobservational
cohort study, six pregnant patients exposed to lansoprazole
during the ﬁrst trimester delivered seven healthy newborns.
The relative risk for a congenital malformation was 1.6
(0.1–5.2) and for low birth weight, it was 1.8 (0.2–13.1).
Pantoprazole

Pantoprazole is also a category B drug. In a European cohort
study, 53 pregnant women were exposed to pantoprazole, and

21 Gastrointestinal Disease and Pregnancy

the rate observed for congenital anomalies was 2.1%. Although
the newer proton pump inhibitors rabeprazole and esomeprazole are also category B drugs, no controlled data are available about them; thus, their use is not recommended during
pregnancy.

Peptic Ulcer Disease

Treatment for peptic ulcer disease involves the use of proton
pump inhibitors or H2 blockers, which are considered above
with gastroesophageal reﬂux disease. If peptic ulcer disease is
related to Helicobacter pylori infection, treatment of the infection can be deferred until after pregnancy. The most common
regimen involves triple therapy with a proton pump inhibitor,
amoxicillin, and clarithromycin. Alternatively, metronidazole,
bismuth, and tetracycline are used as part of the regimen. In
the unusual case for which treatment is warranted during the
gravid period, tetracycline and bismuth should not be used.
Amoxicillin

Amoxicillin is a category B drug. A population-based study of
401 women treated with amoxicillin did not show any increased
risk of congenital malformation or any other adverse event
compared with pregnant women not treated with amoxicillin.
Clarithromycin

Clarithromycin, a category C drug, has a higher rate of placental passage than other macrolide antibiotics. In a prospective
study of clarithromycin in pregnancy, no increased risk of
congenital malformations was reported; however, the rate of
spontaneous abortions was higher than in the unexposed
group. A retrospective surveillance study of clarithromycin
exposure within 270 days of delivery showed no increase in
congenital malformations, compared with that of the general
population of pregnant women.
Tetracycline

Tetracycline, a category D drug, is possibly unsafe during lactation. It is considered below with infectious diarrhea.
Metronidazole

Metronidazole is a category B drug and low risk during lactation. It is considered below with infectious diarrhea.
Bismuth

Bismuth, a category C drug, is one of the most commonly
used over-the-counter antacids. Fetotoxicity from bismuth
has been described in animals. Exposure to bismuth subsalicylate during late pregnancy may increase the risk of closure
or constriction of the fetal ductus arteriosus, resulting in

237

pulmonary hypertension. Bismuth is considered as possibly
unsafe during lactation.

Acute and Chronic Pancreatitis

Acute pancreatitis often resolves with supportive care. If analgesia is required, meperidine and fentanyl are the preferred
medications (see above, Endoscopy). Three approaches to
decrease bacterial infections in acute necrotizing pancreatitis
include enteral feedings to avoid infections related to the
central line, selective decontamination of the gut with
nonabsorbable antibiotics, and prophylaxis with systemic
antibiotics.
In acute pancreatitis, gut decontamination is achieved with
a combination of norﬂoxacin, colistin, and amphotericin.
Norﬂoxacin is a category C drug. Fluoroquinolone antibiotics
cross the placenta and have a high afﬁnity for cartilage, raising
concern about fetotoxicity. However, a prospective study of
200 women exposed to ﬂuoroquinolones during the ﬁrst trimester did not demonstrate an increased risk of major congenital malformations when compared with controls matched
for age and tobacco and alcohol use. The rates for spontaneous abortion, fetal distress, and prematurity were also similar,
but the rate of therapeutic abortion was higher for the ﬂuoroquinolone-exposed group. Amphotericin is a category B drug.
The Collaborative Perinatal Project monitored 50,282 motherchild pairs, of whom 9 had ﬁrst trimester exposure to amphotericin B. No adverse events were noted. Also, because many
other studies have not shown an association with congenital
malformations, amphotericin B is the antifungal of choice
during pregnancy.
Imipenem-cilastatin is a category C drug because animal
studies show no teratogenicity, but data for humans are limited. This drug crosses the placenta in rats and concentrations
in rat breast milk equal those in the serum. The pharmacokinetics of imipenem change considerably during pregnancy,
with larger volumes of distribution and faster total clearance
from plasma. Appropriate dose adjustments should be considered during pregnancy. If a pregnant patient has necrotizing pancreatitis, the morbidity of the condition is sufﬁciently
high to warrant imipenem therapy.
Chronic pancreatitis is managed with alcohol cessation,
small low fat meals, analgesia, and pancreatic enzyme supplements. Fentanyl (endoscopy) and amitriptyline (irritable
bowel syndrome) are used for analgesia. Long-acting morphine (MS Contin), a category C drug, is often administered
for chronic pancreatitis. Six case reports about the use of morphine for analgesia during pregnancy did not disclose any
congenital anomalies or neonatal opioid withdrawal. A study
of slow-release morphine in pregnant opioid-addicted women
noted that all infants were healthy, although some required
treatment for neonatal withdrawal. Pancreatic enzymes are a
category C drug because animal reproduction studies have not
been performed. The data on safety during pregnancy and lactation are limited. Generally, these medications should be

238

Section V Colon

avoided if not essential. However, in patients with cystic ﬁbrosis and pancreatic insufﬁciency, maintenance of nutritional
status is a critical factor in pregnancy outcome. In a study of
23 women with 33 pregnancies, 91% of the women received
pancreatic supplementation during pregnancy. The severity of
lung disease predicted preterm delivery, and no congenital
malformations were noted.
Biliary Tract Disease
Choledocholithiasis

Laparoscopic cholecystectomy has become the standard of
care for the management of cholecystitis and symptomatic
choledocholithiasis. Surgical intervention during pregnancy
does not appear to be associated with an increase in complications. Nonsurgical approaches, such as oral chenodeoxycholic
acid and ursodiol (ursodeoxycholic acid [UDCA]) and extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy, have not been used in pregnancy and are not recommended. Chenodeoxycholic acid and
UDCA have been used with limited success in the treatment of
cholesterol gallstones in the general population. No data are

available about chenodeoxycholic acid in pregnancy (UDCA
is discussed with primary sclerosing cholangitis).
Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis

There is no effective medical therapy for primary sclerosing
cholangitis that affects mortality. The medication used most
commonly is UDCA, which can provide symptomatic and
serologic improvement. UDCA is a category B drug. Its safety
during lactation is not known. Fetotoxicity of UDCA has not
been reported in humans; however, the data are not sufﬁcient
to determine risk in the ﬁrst trimester. Case reports have noted
the safety of UDCA in primary sclerosing cholangitis, primary
biliary cirrhosis, and intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy.
UDCA can be administered during pregnancy, especially after
the ﬁrst trimester, to reduce cholestasis and accompanying
sequelae such as pruritus.

21 Gastrointestinal Disease and Pregnancy

Viral Hepatitis

Hepatitis A is a self-limited condition, and the treatment for
pregnant women is similar to that for nonpregnant women.
Both the inactivated vaccine against hepatitis A and postexposure immunoglobulin prophylaxis are safe to administer
during pregnancy.
Hepatitis B infection carries a high rate of vertical transmission, and the indications to treat are much greater during
pregnancy. The vaccine is safe to use. Passive and active immunization, given together, are very effective in preventing neonatal transmission, reducing the carrier state of infants born
to HBeAg (hepatitis B e antigen)/HBsAg (hepatitis B surface
antigen)-positive women from 70% to 90% to almost zero.
Lamivudine

The FDA has classiﬁed lamivudine as a category C drug. For
women with chronic hepatitis B, studies have documented the
safety of lamivudine for continued treatment during pregnancy. Standard doses of lamivudine have been continued
through pregnancy with a hepatitis B virus (HBV)-DNA seroconversion rate of 92%, with no reported complications or
congenital abnormalities. In an earlier study, investigators
treated eight highly viremic women with 150 mg lamivudine
in the third trimester of pregnancy in an attempt to prevent
perinatal transmission of HBV infection. One child was delivered early because of intrauterine growth retardation. All but
one woman had a signiﬁcant decrease in HBV DNA levels
before delivery, and vertical transmission occurred in only one
child.
In the literature on human immunodeﬁciency virus, the
Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry contains 526 live births that
were exposed to lamivudine during the ﬁrst trimester, with
a congenital defect rate of 1.7%. Of 1,256 live births, 25 had a
history of exposure at anytime during pregnancy and showed a
slightly higher rate, 2.5% (1.3–3.0), but this was not statistically
higher than expected. Lamivudine is contraindicated during
nursing because it is excreted into milk in high concentrations.

239

laboratory animals. No human studies have been performed
on the use of this drug during lactation, and its use during this
time is not recommended.
Interferon

Interferon, a category C drug, is contraindicated during pregnancy because of its antiproliferative activity. When administered to pregnant Rhesus monkeys, there was a statistically
signiﬁcant increase in the number of spontaneous abortions.
No teratogenic effects were observed in this species when
doses of 1 to 25 million IU/kg per day were administered
during the early to mid-fetal period. To date, only 27 pregnancies have been reported after exposure to interferon. The
majority of these women were being treated for essential
thrombocythemia and not hepatitis C infection. Premature
delivery occurred in 15% and intrauterine growth retardation
in 22% (6/27) of the patients. A total of eight children have
been born to mothers receiving interferon who were thought
to be at high risk for chronic hepatitis infection. In patients
with chronic infection, it is prudent to delay treatment,
and in women with active infection, interferon therapy still
should be considered only if the health of the mother mandates therapy, with close and careful monitoring. The treatment of hepatitis C with interferon in combination with
ribavirin is contraindicated because of severe neurotoxicity in
children younger than 2 years, and its high potential for teratogenicity (see below).
Ribavirin

This is an antiviral agent used in combination with interferon
for the treatment of hepatitis C. It is a category X drug. A doserelated teratogenicity, as well as embryolethality, has been
demonstrated in all animal species tested. Ribavirin is still
present in human blood 4 weeks after dosing, and it is recommended that patients wait at least 3 months after any exposure
to the drug before conception.
Wilson’s Disease

Adefovir Dipivoxil
Penicillamine

Adefovir dipivoxil is a category C drug. No adequate wellcontrolled studies have been conducted on the use of adefovir
dipivoxil in pregnant women. This drug is indicated for
the treatment of chronic hepatitis B in adults who have evidence of active viral replication and evidence of either persistent increases in the serum level of aminotransferases or
histologically active disease. During clinical trials with this
agent, 16 pregnancies with known outcomes were reported.
Ten women had a therapeutic abortion, two had a spontaneous abortion, three delivered healthy babies, and one delivered a live born infant at 25 weeks gestation who died 4 days
later. Studies conducted with adefovir dipivoxil administered
orally in doses up to 23 times that achieved in humans
have failed to show any embryotoxicity or teratogenicity in

Penicillamine, a category D drug, is a chelating agent that is
ﬁrst-line therapy for Wilson’s disease. Only a few reports are
available about the outcome of pregnancies in women with
Wilson’s disease. The largest recent case series is from India,
where 59 pregnancies in 16 women were studied retrospectively. In this group were 24 spontaneous abortions, 3 stillbirths, 2 terminations, and 30 successful pregnancies. The
majority of the spontaneous abortions were in women who
were not receiving therapy. Other case reports have documented severe embryopathy characterized by micrognathia,
diffuse cutis laxa, and agenesis of the corpus callosum in addition to transient fetal myelosuppression. It is debated whether
penicillamine therapy should be continued during pregnancy,

240

Section V Colon

and various authors have disagreed on whether to use the
agent and, if so, how much to administer.
Trientine

Trientine is a category C drug and is used if no other alternatives are appropriate to treat the mother’s liver disease. This
chelating agent is an alternative to penicillamine and is available only as an orphan drug for use in Wilson’s disease.
Because there are few other options, the beneﬁt is thought to
outweigh the risk.
Primary Biliary Cirrhosis
Ursodeoxycholic Acid

UDCA is a category B drug. Because of the paucity of data
about its safety in the ﬁrst trimester, its use during this time is
not recommended unless essential. It has been administered
to women during the second and third trimesters with no
deterioration of liver function noted. No fetal loss or unfavorable outcomes were noted in 10 women receiving the drug. In
a randomized controlled trial of UDCA in intrahepatic
cholestasis of pregnancy, it was shown to improve pruritus
and liver enzymes, and it allowed for delivery closer to term. A
second randomized controlled trial of UDCA versus
cholestyramine reported similar results: symptoms were alleviated and babies were delivered signiﬁcantly closer to term in
the UDCA-treated patients.
Portal Hypertension
Propranolol

Because nadolol has a long half-life, low protein binding,
and lack of metabolism, the recommendation is that, if treatment is strongly indicated, alternative agents in this class
be used.

Liver Transplantation

The best data available about medications for transplant
recipients are from the National Transplantation Pregnancy
Registry. Every year, an updated report is presented with the
results of a prospective database of all transplant recipients.
The most recent published report is from 2003. The rate of live
births was 77% for women receiving cyclosporine, 82% for
those receiving cyclosporine (speciﬁcally, Neoral), and 72%
for those receiving tacrolimus. Two patients were receiving
mycophenolate mofetil therapy and delivered healthy infants.
The mean gestational age was 37 weeks, and the rate of low
birth weight was 29% to 42%. The conclusion of the Advisory
Board was that “the majority of pregnancy outcomes reported
to the Registry appear favorable for parent and newborn.”
Cyclosporine

Cyclosporine is a category C drug. A meta-analysis of ﬁfteen
studies of pregnancy outcomes after cyclosporine therapy
reported a total of 410 patients, with data on major malformations. The calculated OR of 3.83 for malformations did
not achieve statistical signiﬁcance, with a 95% conﬁdence
interval of 0.75–19.6. The rate of malformations was 4.1%,
not different from that of the general population. The conclusion of the study was that cyclosporine did not appear to be
a major human teratogen. The American Academy of
Pediatrics considers cyclosporine contraindicated during
breastfeeding because of the potential for immune suppression and neutropenia.

Propranolol, a category C drug, is a nonselective β-adrenergic
blocking agent used for prophylaxis against variceal bleeding
in patients with cirrhosis. It has been administered during
pregnancy to treat maternal thyrotoxicosis, arrhythmias, and
hypertension. It readily crosses the placenta and, thus, is used
also to treat fetal arrhythmias. Adverse outcomes have not
been clearly linked to its use, but daily doses greater than 160 mg
appear to produce more serious fetal cardiac complications.
No data have been reported for outcomes of women who took
this drug for variceal prophylaxis. Propranolol is not a teratogen, but fetal and neonatal toxicity may occur. Maternal use
after the second trimester can result in signiﬁcant weight
reductions in the infant. Therefore, it is not recommended for
use after the ﬁrst trimester unless the underlying condition of
the mother requires continued β-blockade.

Tacrolimus is also a category C drug. The earliest experience
with this medication was in 1997, with a report of 27 pregnancies with exposure to tacrolimus. Another study from Germany
reported on 100 pregnancies in transplant recipients followed
from 1992 to 1998. The live birth rate was 68%, the spontaneous abortion rate 12%, and the stillbirth rate 3%, and 59% of
the infants were premature. Malformations occurred in four
neonates, with no consistent defects. Tacrolimus is contraindicated during lactation because of the high concentrations
found in breast milk.

Nadolol

Sirolimus

Nadolol, a category C drug, is another nonselective
β-adrenergic blocker. It is an alternative to propranolol. This
medication is used predominantly as an antihypertensive, and
no data are available when used for variceal prophylaxis.

Sirolimus is a category C drug. Little is known about its effect
in humans. Sirolimus is another agent used for immune
suppression in transplant recipients. Three patients in the
National Transplantation Pregnancy Registry were treated

Tacrolimus

21 Gastrointestinal Disease and Pregnancy

with sirolimus, but they were kidney recipients. Because of the
relative paucity of information, and the reasonable alternatives for immunosuppression, this agent is not recommended
during pregnancy.
Mycophenolate Mofetil

Mycophenolate mofetil, a category C drug, has been shown in
laboratory animals to have teratogenic properties. This drug is
a relatively new addition to the armamentarium for immunosuppression in liver transplant patients. In a single case report
from the obstetrical literature, a kidney transplant recipient
was treated with mycophenolate mofetil before conception
and during the ﬁrst trimester of pregnancy. The fetus had
facial dysmorphology and multiple midline anomalies. The
molecular weight of this agent is low enough that it most likely
crosses the placenta. It is not recommended for use in pregnancy. The manufacturer recommends women use effective
contraception before and during therapy and for 6 weeks after
therapy has stopped.

241

Irritable Bowel Syndrome

Irritable bowel syndrome is a heterogeneous disorder without
a standardized therapeutic regimen. No large epidemiologic
studies have been conducted in pregnant women with preexisting irritable bowel syndrome. If possible, medications
should be avoided and dietary alterations and ﬁber supplementation should be the ﬁrst step for complaints of constipation. The following is a summary of available safety data about
drugs for irritable bowel syndrome should medication be
required. Note that most drug therapies for the treatment of
this syndrome have not demonstrated efﬁcacy over placebo.
The use of medications for irritable bowel syndrome during
pregnancy is summarized in Table 21.6.
Constipation

For a pregnant woman with constipation, ﬁrst-line therapy
should be ﬁber supplements, introduced gradually to avoid
excessive gas and bloating, and adequate water intake.

Section V Colon

Often, new-onset constipation during early pregnancy is due
to iron therapy, and symptomatic relief can be achieved with
docusate, now a component of some prenatal vitamins. When
these methods are inadequate, an osmotic laxative should be
considered, particularly a polyethylene glycol solution.
Osmotic laxatives include saline osmotics (magnesium and
sodium salts), saccharated osmotics (lactulose and sorbitol),
and polyethylene glycol. Saline osmotic laxatives such as magnesium citrate (category B) and sodium phosphate have rapid
onset of action but are intended for short-term intermittent
relief. Long-term use can result in hypermagnesemia, hyperphosphatemia, and dehydration. No human studies are available on the use of lactulose (category B) during pregnancy.
Polyethylene glycol (category C) is negligibly absorbed and
metabolized in humans, making it unlikely to cause malformations. Also, it is effective and well tolerated compared with
lactulose. The results of animal teratogenesis studies have been
negative. A consensus meeting on the management of constipation in pregnancy considered polyethylene glycol to meet
the criteria for an ideal laxative in pregnancy: effective, not
absorbed (nonteratogenic), well tolerated, and safe. However,
the consensus members thought that current data were insufﬁcient to demonstrate conclusively whether absorption of
polyethylene glycol affects the fetus.
Stimulant laxatives such as senna (category C) and bisacodyl (category C) are considered safe for short-term use, but
long-term use is not recommended. Because senna is excreted
in breast milk, it should be used with caution during lactation.
Docusate (category C), a stool softener, is generally considered safe. Castor oil (category X) should be avoided because it
is associated with uterine contraction and even rupture.
Mineral oil also should be avoided because it can impair
maternal fat-soluble vitamin absorption, leading to neonatal
coagulopathy and hemorrhage.
Tegaserod (category B), a serotonin 5-hydroxytryptamine4
receptor agonist, was approved by the FDA for the treatment
of constipation-type irritable bowel syndrome and chronic
constipation. It was withdrawn from the market in 2007
because of concern about an increased risk of cardiac events
with its use.
Diarrhea

In a trial of 105 women exposed to loperamide (category B)
during pregnancy, it was not found to be associated with an
increased risk of congenital malformations, although 20% of
the infants were 200 g smaller than infants in the control
group. At least 187 cases of ﬁrst-trimester exposure have been
reported, with no evidence of developmental toxicity.
Cholestyramine (category C), an anion exchange resin, is
often used to treat cholestasis of pregnancy and can be used to
manage diarrhea resulting from ileal resection or cholecystectomy. However, fat-soluble vitamin deﬁciency, including
coagulopathy, can occur, so it should be used with caution.
Kaolin and pectin, or kaopectate (category B), was an antidi-

arrheal of choice because it was not absorbed and did not cross
the placenta. Concern did arise over the potential for kaolininduced iron deﬁciency anemia. In 2003, kaopectate was
reformulated to contain bismuth subsalicylate (category C).
Bismuth subsalicylate, alone or in kaopectate, should be
avoided in pregnancy because the salicylates can be absorbed
and lead to increased perinatal mortality, premature closure
of the ductus arteriosus, neonatal hemorrhage, decreased birth
weight, prolonged gestation and labor, and possible teratogenicity. Alosetron (category B) has restricted access because of
concern about ischemic colitis. It generally should be avoided
during pregnancy.
For pregnant women with diarrhea, dietary modiﬁcation,
with reduction of fats and dairy, can improve symptoms.
Although human data are limited, both loperamide and diphenoxylate are considered “low risk” and can be used with discretion. Patients with a previous history of eating disorders
can have a difﬁcult time during pregnancy and should be
observed carefully and provided with adequate counseling
and psychiatric support.
Antidepressants

Tricyclic antidepressants (amitriptyline and desipramine, both
category C drugs, and nortriptyline and imipramine, both category D drugs), and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors
(SSRIs) (generally category C drugs) are frequently used in the
management of irritable bowel syndrome. Overall, the newer
antidepressants (citalopram, escitalopram, ﬂuoxetine, ﬂuvoxamine, sertraline, reboxetine, venlafaxine, nefazodone, trazodone, mirtazapine, and bupropion) are not associated with
an increased rate of major malformations compared with that
of the general population. Recently, however, an unpublished
study by GlaxoSmithKline of 3,500 pregnant women noted
twice as many birth defects with paroxetine than with other
antidepressants (Table 21.6). The absolute rate of major congenital malformations in the ﬁrst trimester for paroxetine
users was 4% and 2% for cardiovascular malformations.
Infants exposed to antidepressants are also at higher risk for
other adverse events. A large Swedish study of 997 infants
exposed to antidepressants during pregnancy noted an
increased risk of preterm birth, low birth weight, low Apgar
score, respiratory distress, neonatal convulsions, and hypoglycemia. There was a trend toward worse outcome with tricyclic
antidepressants compared with SSRIs. Multiple studies with
SSRIs have conﬁrmed that the rate of congenital malformations for infants exposed to these drugs is similar to that for
the general population; however, the studies also have noted a
higher rate of premature delivery, respiratory difﬁculty, cyanosis on feeding, and jitteriness as well as low birth weight and
neonatal convulsions for the SSRI group of infants. The effects
of SSRI exposure through the placenta on neonatal adaptation
and long-term neurocognitive development is debated. If the
antidepressant is being administered solely to treat symptoms
of irritable bowel syndrome and not an associated major

the drug therapy during the gravid period.

prompting the World Health Organization to recommend
antihelminthic therapy in pregnancy.

Other Medications

Ampicillin

Antispasmodics are prescribed frequently for the management
of abdominal pain in irritable bowel syndrome. Dicyclomine
(category B), in combination with pyridoxine and doxylamine
(Bendectin), has been associated with multiple congenital
anomalies, but the studies have not been conclusive.
Hyoscyamine (category C) has not been studied in pregnancy.

Ampicillin, a category B drug, is not considered teratogenic. It
is second-line treatment for Shigella infection. Ampicillin
passes through the placenta by simple diffusion and is excreted
into breast milk in low concentrations.

Infectious Diarrhea

Diarrhea can be described as acute (<14 days), persistent
(>14 days), or chronic (>30 days). Although most episodes of
diarrhea are self-limited and treatment is not required, certain
pathogens require treatment. The common medications used
to treat infectious diarrhea are summarized in Table 21.7.
Albendazole

Albendazole, a category C drug, is used in the treatment of
microsporidia infection, cysticercosis, helminth infection, and
hydatid disease. The drug is embryotoxic and teratogenic
(skeletal malformations) in rats and rabbits. Human data are
limited. Albendazole therapy for the eradication of helminths
during pregnancy is associated with signiﬁcantly less maternal
anemia and no increase in adverse pregnancy outcomes,

Azithromycin

Azithromycin, a macrolide antibiotic, is pregnancy category B
and is a second-line treatment for cryptosporidia and Entamoeba
histolytica infections. A study of 20 women who received the
drug for Chlamydia trachomatis infection noted that 40%
complained of moderate to severe gastrointestinal side effects.
A trial of 94 pregnant women with Trichomonas vaginalis
treated with a combination of azithromycin, ceﬁxime, and
metronidazole demonstrated increased rates of infant low
birth weight, preterm birth, and 2-year mortality compared to
the children of 112 infected mothers who were not treated for
the same infection.
Doxycycline and Tetracycline

Doxycycline and tetracycline are both category D drugs.
Doxycycline is used as second-line treatment for infections
with Vibrio cholera, Campylobacter, and enterotoxigenic
Escherichia coli. Similar to tetracycline, this class of medications

crosses the placenta and is bound by chelating with calcium in
developing bone and teeth. This results in discoloration of the
teeth, hypoplasia of enamel, and inhibition of skeletal growth.
A population-based study found a higher rate of congenital
anomalies in the infants of mothers who used doxycycline
during pregnancy; however, the case-control pair analysis did
not show a signiﬁcantly higher rate of doxycycline treatment
in the second and third months of gestation in any group of
congenital abnormalities.
Furazolidone

Furazolidone, a category C drug, is second-line treatment for
giardiasis. Few data are available about its safety in pregnancy,
but the Collaborative Perinatal Project monitored 50,282
mother-child pairs and 132 had exposure to furazolidone
in the ﬁrst trimester, with no association with congenital
malformations.
Metronidazole

Metronidazole, a category B drug, is used to treat Clostridium
difﬁcile infection, amebiasis, and giardiasis. Multiple studies
have suggested that exposure to metronidazole prenatally is
not associated with birth defects. These studies include two
meta-analyses, two retrospective cohort studies, and a prospective controlled study of 228 women exposed to metronidazole during pregnancy. A population-based case-control
study found that overall teratogenic risk was low, but infants
of women exposed to metronidazole in the second to third
months of pregnancy had higher rates of cleft lip, with or
without cleft palate. This increase was slight and not thought
to be clinically signiﬁcant.
Quinolones

Quinolones (eg, ciproﬂoxacin, levoﬂoxacin, and norﬂoxacin),
category C drugs, are used to treat infections with Shigella,
Campylobacter, Yersinia, entertoxigenic and enteroinvasive
E coli, and Vibrio cholera. Quinolones have a high afﬁnity for
bone tissue and cartilage and may cause arthropathies in children. The manufacturer reports damage to cartilage in weightbearing joints after quinolone exposure in immature rats and
dogs. However, a prospective controlled study of 200 women
exposed to quinolones and a population-based cohort study
of 57 women exposed to quinolones did not ﬁnd an increased
risk of congenital malformations. Overall, the risk is thought
to be minimal, but because safer alternatives are available,
quinolones should be avoided in pregnancy.

complications in rats and rabbits. However, other studies have
noted teratogenicity in rats and rabbits, including cleft palate
and incomplete ossiﬁcation.
Tinidazole

Tinidazole, a category C drug, is a second-line treatment for
giardiasis and amebiasis. Placental transfer of tinidazole occurs
early in pregnancy, raising concern about its use in the ﬁrst
trimester. A population-based study from Hungary did not
note an increased rate of congenital malformations when the
drug was administered during pregnancy; however, the
number of women treated with tinidazole was small.
Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole

Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, a category C drug, is ﬁrstline treatment for infections with Isospora and Cyclospora and
second-line treatment of infections with Shigella, Yersinia, and
enterotoxigenic E coli. Trimethoprim has antifolate effects,
increasing the potential of congenital anomalies. A study of
2,296 Michigan Medicaid recipients with ﬁrst-trimester exposure to trimethoprim noted an increased risk of birth defects,
particularly cardiovascular defects. A population-based casecontrol study in Hungary noted a higher rate of multiple congenital anomalies and cardiovascular malformations. On the
basis of these data, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole should be
avoided in pregnancy.
Vancomycin

Vancomycin, a category C drug, is used in the treatment of
C difﬁcile colitis refractory to treatment with metronidazole.
Studies in rats and rabbits have not demonstrated teratogenic
effects. No cases of congenital defects attributable to vancomycin have been located, and the drug is considered low risk
in pregnancy.

Inﬂammatory Bowel Disease

For patients with Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis, disease activity at the time of conception can be associated with a
higher risk of spontaneous abortion and disease activity during
the course of pregnancy can be associated with higher rates of
low birth weight and premature infants. It is advisable that
patients be in remission when considering pregnancy, and for
the majority, this requires continuing the medications.
Medications used to treat inﬂammatory bowel disease are
summarized in Table 21.8.

Rifaximin
Aminosalicylates

Rifaximin, a category C drug, is used to treat traveler’s
diarrhea. Little information exists about its safety in pregnancy. Rifaximin has not been found to affect fertility or pregnancy outcome in rats or, in one study, to cause teratogenic

All aminosalicylates (sulfasalazine, mesalamine, and balsalazide) are category B drugs except olsalazine, which is category

Control Surveillance of Congenital Abnormalities database
did not ﬁnd a signiﬁcant increase in the prevalence of congenital abnormalities in the children of women treated with
sulfasalazine. Because of concern about potential antifolate
effects of sulfasalazine, it is recommended that women take
folic acid 1 mg twice daily in the prenatal period and throughout pregnancy. Unlike with other sulfonamides, bilirubin displacement and, thus, kernicterus do not occur in the infant.
Sulfasalazine has been clearly associated with infertility in men.
Abnormalities in sperm number, motility, and morphology
have been noted. This effect appears to be reversible: when
mesalamine was substituted for sulfasalazine, semen quality
returned to normal. An association has been described between
sulfasalazine use in the parent and congenital malformations
in the progeny. Because the lifespan of sperm is 120 days, men
considering conception should either stop taking sulfasalazine
or switch to mesalamine at least 3 months before attempting
conception.
Case series of mesalamine use in pregnancy do not suggest
an increased risk to the fetus. This has been supported by a
prospective controlled trial of 165 women exposed to mesalamine who were compared with matched controls with no
exposure and by a population-based cohort study from
Denmark.

Antibiotics

Metronidazole, the quinolones, and rifaximin are covered in the
section on infectious diarrhea. Because of the limited evidence
of the effectiveness of these agents in treating inﬂammatory
bowel disease and the extended duration of use in the treatment of Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis, these drugs
should be avoided during pregnancy. Short courses for the
treatment of pouchitis can be considered on the basis of the
safety data presented above. An alternative antibiotic for
pouchitis is amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, a category B drug.
Corticosteroids

Corticosteroids are category C drugs. A case-control study of
corticosteroid use during the ﬁrst trimester of pregnancy
noted an increased risk of oral clefts in the newborn. This was
conﬁrmed by a large case-control study and a meta-analysis,
which reported a summary OR for case-control studies examining the risk of oral clefts (OR 3.35 [95% CI 1.97, 5.69]).
However, the population was treated for various conditions,
and the overall risk of major malformations was low (OR 1.45
[95% CI 0.80, 2.60]). A prospective controlled study of
311 women who received glucocorticosteroids during the ﬁrst

246

Section V Colon

trimester did not note an increased rate of major anomalies,
and cases of oral cleft were not noted. The study was powered
to ﬁnd a 2.5-fold increase in the overall rate of major anomalies. An increased risk of premature rupture of membranes
and adrenal insufﬁciency in the newborn has been reported in
the transplant setting. Overall, the use of corticosteroids poses
a small risk to the developing infant, and the mother needs
to be informed about both the beneﬁts and risks of therapy.
A small retrospective review of patients with inﬂammatory
bowel disease treated with budesonide during pregnancy did
not document congenital malformations or an increase in
adverse outcomes.
Bisphosphonates

The bisphosphonates, alendronate and risedronate, are category C drugs. Their safety in breastfeeding is not known. For
many patients, treatment of inﬂammatory bowel disease starts
with these medications in conjunction with corticosteroids to
prevent bone loss. Both agents should be avoided in pregnancy
because animal studies have shown that alendronate crosses the
placenta and is stored in fetal bone, causing anatomical changes.
The effects on human fetal bone development are not known.
The half-life of alendronate is longer than 10 years, and it accumulates in bone. The concern with giving this agent to a woman
of child-bearing potential is that the drug is released slowly
from bone and may produce low-level, continuous exposure to
the fetus throughout gestation. Risedronate has a half-life of
20 days and may be the better choice for a woman contemplating future pregnancy. However, ﬁve half-lives of the drug
are needed to excrete 97% of it, so women should wait at least
100 days from the last dose before considering conception.
Immunomodulators

The immunomodulators are the most controversial agents
used to treat inﬂammatory bowel disease in pregnant women.
Methotrexate

Methotrexate, a category X drug, is clearly teratogenic and
should not be administered to women or men who are considering conception. Methotrexate is a folic acid antagonist, and
its use during the critical period of organogenesis (6–8 weeks
postconception) is associated with multiple congenital anomalies collectively called methotrexate embryopathy or fetal
aminopterin-methotrexate syndrome. This syndrome is characterized by intrauterine growth retardation; decreased ossiﬁcation of the calvarium; hypoplastic supraorbital ridges; small,
low-set ears; micrognathia; limb abnormalities; and, occasionally, mental retardation. Exposure in the second and third trimesters may be associated with fetal toxicity and mortality.
Methotrexate may cause reversible oligospermia in men. No
case reports have been published on congenital anomalies
occurring in the offspring of men receiving methotrexate
therapy. Methotrexate may persist in tissues for long periods,

and it has been suggested that patients wait at least 3 to
6 months after discontinuation of treatment with the drug
before attempting conception.
Azathioprine and 6-Mercaptopurine

6-Mercaptopurine and its prodrug azathioprine are category
D drugs. Animal studies have demonstrated teratogenicity,
with increased frequencies of cleft palate and open-eye and
skeletal anomalies in mice exposed to azathioprine and cleft
palate and skeletal and urogenital anomalies in rats.
Transplacental and transamniotic transmission of azathioprine and its metabolites from the mother to the fetus can
occur. The oral bioavailability of azathioprine (47%) and
6-mercaptopurine (16%) is low, and the early fetal liver lacks
the enzyme inosinate pyrophosphorylase needed to convert
azathioprine to 6-mercaptopurine. Both features may protect
the fetus from toxic drug exposure during the crucial period of
organogenesis. The largest evidence on safety comes from
transplantation studies, in which rates of anomalies ranged
from zero to 11.8%, and no evidence emerged for recurrent
patterns of congenital anomalies. Multiple case series of
inﬂammatory bowel disease have not noted an increase in
congenital anomalies. On the basis of the large experience in
transplantation patients and the body of evidence in inﬂammatory bowel disease, the drugs are often continued during
pregnancy to maintain the mother in remission. A ﬂare of disease during pregnancy may be more deleterious to neonatal
outcome than any potential risk from the medication.
Cyclosporine and Tacrolimus

These agents are considered in the section on liver transplantation. For severe steroid-refractory ulcerative colitis,
cyclosporine may be a better treatment option than colectomy, which is associated with a considerable morbidity rate
for mother and fetus.
Thalidomide

Thalidomide, a category X drug, has some anti-tumor necrosis factor effects and has been used successfully for the treatment of Crohn’s disease. However, its teratogenicity has been
documented extensively and includes limb defects, central
nervous system effects, and abnormalities of the respiratory,
cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and genitourinary systems.
Thalidomide is contraindicated during pregnancy and for
women of childbearing age who are not using two reliable
methods of contraception for 1 month before starting therapy,
during therapy, and for 1 month after stopping therapy.
Biologic Therapy
Inﬂiximab

Inﬂiximab, a category B drug, is used in the management
of Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis. A growing body of

21 Gastrointestinal Disease and Pregnancy

evidence suggests that inﬂiximab is low risk in pregnancy. The
two largest studies are from the TREAT registry and the
Inﬂiximab Safety Database maintained by Centocor (Malvern,
PA). The TREAT registry is a prospective registry of patients
with Crohn’s disease, and patients may or may not be treated
with inﬂiximab. Sixty-six pregnancies were reported among
the 5,807 patients enrolled, and 36 of the 66 had prior exposure to inﬂiximab. Fetal malformations have not occurred in
any of the pregnancies. The rates of miscarriage (11.1% vs
7.1%, P=.53) and neonatal complications (8.3% vs 7.1%,
P=.78) are not signiﬁcantly different between inﬂiximabtreated and inﬂiximab-naïve patients, respectively.
In the Inﬂiximab Safety Database, a retrospective data collection, pregnancy outcome data are available for 96 women
who had direct exposure to inﬂiximab. The 96 pregnancies
resulted in 100 births. The expected versus observed outcomes
for women exposed to inﬂiximab were not different from
those of the general population. In a series of 10 women who
received maintenance therapy with inﬂiximab throughout
pregnancy, all 10 pregnancies ended in live births and no congenital malformations were reported.
Inﬂiximab probably crosses the placenta, beginning at
approximately week 20. Currently, if maternal health warrants
inﬂiximab therapy, it is continued through pregnancy.
Adalimumab

Adalimumab, a category B drug, has been shown recently to
be safe and effective for the induction of remission in Crohn’s
disease. A case report has documented a successful pregnancy
in a woman with long-standing Crohn’s disease who began
treatment with adalimumab 1 month before conception
and received a total of 38 doses during her pregnancy. It is
unclear if the drug crosses the placenta but is assumed to do
so, starting at about week 20. Adalimumab therapy during
pregnancy is warranted for active disease or maintenance of
remission.
Certolizumab Pegol

Certolizumab is a pegylated Fab′ fragment of IgG1 antibody
against tumor necrosis factor-α. Early data suggest that negligible amounts occur in cord blood of infants born to mothers
treated with this agent during pregnancy. Because of its small
molecular size, certolizumab pegol may have an advantage for
use in pregnancy. Certolizumab pegol therapy is warranted
during pregnancy for active inﬂammatory bowel disease or
maintenance of remission.
Natalizumab

Natalizumab is a monoclonal antibody of the IgG4 class
directed against alpha integrins. It carries an FDA category B
rating. On the basis of animal and trial data, it is listed as a
category B drug. Few data are available about its use in pregnancy in the postmarketing era. Currently, there are no ﬁrm

247

recommendations about its use treating inﬂammatory bowel
disease in pregnant women.
Fish Oil Supplements

Many patients who have inﬂammatory bowel disease take ﬁsh
oil supplements as an adjunct to standard medical therapy.
Because ﬁsh oil is a supplement and not a drug, it is not rated
by the FDA. A randomized controlled trial of ﬁsh oil supplementation demonstrated a prolongation of pregnancy without detrimental effects on the growth of the fetus or the course
of labor. Fish oil supplementation may help prevent miscarriage associated with the antiphospholipid antibody syndrome. In women with inﬂammatory bowel disease who may
be at increased risk for preterm birth and miscarriage, ﬁsh oil
supplementation is not harmful and may be of some beneﬁt.

V.5. A 30-year-old woman with established Crohn’s colitis
returns after new symptoms develop. Two weeks ago,
perianal pain developed and she thought it was related
to her hemorrhoids. One week ago, a small “pimple”
developed near the anus that was painful to touch,
until it began draining cloudy ﬂuid 2 days ago. She also
has noted air bubbles in her urine over the last month.

complains that the symptoms have returned after 5
weeks of receiving an infusion. What is the next best
step?
a. Add azathioprine after checking the TPMT level
b. Decrease the dosing interval to every 5 weeks
c. Begin premedication with diphenhydramine and
acetaminophen

cramping. What is the next appropriate recommendation for maintenance therapy?
a. Stop all medications because the patient’s disease is
in remission
b. Maintain treatment with 4.8 g mesalamine
c. Change to azathioprine after checking the TPMT
level
d. Decrease the dose of mesalamine to 2.4 g/day

d. Psychiatry consultation
e. A low-dose tricyclic agent

Questions and Answers

V.28. A 45-year-old woman has constipation. She can go
2 weeks without a bowel movement and does not feel
fullness or pain. She eventually becomes bloated and
may pass a liquid stool. Otherwise, she feels well. She
has no marked vomiting, and her weight is stable.
She has tried several laxatives without success. She
had anorectal manometry and was able to expel the
balloon. Next, a whole-gut transit study was performed. At 2 hours, 54% had left the stomach and at
4 hours 90%. The geometric center at 4 hours was
1.3 and at 24 hours 1.5. The test was continued for
48 hours, and the geometric center was 1.8. The best
recommendation is:
a. Reassurance and symptom-based care
b. Pelvic ﬂoor retraining
c. Colectomy
d. Tissue transglutaminase
e. A low-dose tricyclic agent
V.29. A 55-year-old woman presents with diarrhea and
weight loss. She has diarrhea day and night and has
lost 25 lb in weight. She has had a rash on her leg. She
does not have abdominal pain or discomfort. Other
members of her family have had a similar problem
but did not seek medical attention for it. The best
recommendation is:
a. Reassurance and symptom-based care
b. Pelvic ﬂoor retraining
c. Colectomy
d. Gluten-free diet
e. A low-dose tricyclic agent
V.30. A 38-year-old woman presents with abdominal pain
not associated with the bowels or eating. She just has
pain all the time. It never goes away. She notices that
the pain might change when she moves or coughs.
She has a history of constipation with some straining. On physical examination, she is tender over the
rectus muscle. This tenderness worsens when she
ﬂexes her abdominal muscles. The best recommendation is:
a. Reassurance and symptom-based care
b. Pelvic ﬂoor retraining
c. Colectomy
d. Gluten-free diet
e. Abdominal wall injection
V.31. A 55-year-old woman has had constipation for
3 years. Despite straining excessively, applying
manual abdominal pressure, and bending over, she
requires 15 minutes or longer to evacuate stool from
the rectum. She has abdominal bloating and uses
enemas. Dietary ﬁber supplements have not been
effective. Currently, she takes lubiprostone (8 mg
twice daily) and milk of magnesia twice weekly, and
small, semiformed liquid stools are expelled the day
after she has milk of magnesia. Her appetite and

253

weight are stable, and she has no history of gastrointestinal tract bleeding. Physical examination ﬁndings are unremarkable except for the digital rectal
examination, which disclosed normal anal resting
tone, hesitant squeeze to voluntary command, and
reduced perineal descent during simulated evacuation. Results of a complete blood count, routine
chemistry panel, and sensitive TSH are normal.
Colonoscopy results were normal 2 years ago. The
most appropriate next step to evaluate this patient’s
symptoms is:
a. Repeat colonoscopy
b. Assess colonic transit with radiopaque markers or
scintigraphy and assess anorectal function with
manometry
c. Refer to a surgeon for subtotal colectomy
d. Increase dietary ﬁber content
V.32. Which of the following statements about the assessment of anorectal function in patients with chronic
constipation is correct?
a. Digital rectal examination is not useful for identifying defecatory disorders
b. The rectal balloon expulsion test is highly sensitive
and speciﬁc for diagnosing defecatory disorders
c. Dyssynergia documented on anal manometry is
diagnostic of a defecatory disorder
d. Barium or magnetic resonance proctography has
no role in the diagnosis of defecatory disorders
V.33. Which of the following statements about colonic
motor activity is inaccurate?
a. Colonic motor activity increases after a meal
b. High-amplitude propagated contractions occur
an average of 5 times daily and often precede
defecation
c. The sympathetic nervous system stimulates colonic
motor activity via adrenergic α1 receptors
d. Rectal distention can induce colocolonic and
colointestinal inhibitory reﬂexes, which can delay
intestinal and colonic transit
e. Serotonin induces peristalsis (ie, coordinated contraction proximal to and relaxation distal to the
point of intestinal distention)
V.34. Which of the following statements about the clinical
features of chronic constipation is inaccurate?
a. Constipation is deﬁned not only by decreased stool
frequency but also by other symptoms (eg, straining, lumpy or hard stools, or sensation of incomplete evacuations)
b. Stool frequency is an accurate surrogate marker of
colonic transit
c. Extremes of stool form correlate strongly with
colonic transit
d. A digital rectal examination is useful for identifying
pelvic ﬂoor dysfunction

254

Section V Colon

Answers

V.1. Answer d.
Capsule endoscopy would not be appropriate because of
the possibility of stricturing disease in a patient with
Crohn’s disease. The concern would be capsule retention. All the other diagnostic tests would be reasonable
for a patient with Crohn’s disease who has the presenting complaints described in this case.
V.2. Answer d.
The patient has evidence of a “cecal patch,” or periappendiceal inﬂammation, together with left-sided colitis.
This can occur in ulcerative colitis and should not be
confused with Crohn’s colitis. Serologic testing further
supports the diagnosis of ulcerative colitis.
V.3. Answer a.
Patients with extensive colitis (pancolitis) are at increased
risk for developing colorectal cancer after 8 to 10 years
of disease. Colonoscopy with surveillance biopsies for
detecting dysplasia is recommended every 1 to 2 years.
V.4. Answer c.
Smoking increases symptomatic recurrences of Crohn’s
disease. This is often a concern postoperatively. Patients
with Crohn’s colitis affecting more than one-third of the
colon are believed to be at increased risk for colon cancer
after 8 to 10 years of disease. Inﬂammatory bowel disease is more common in cold climates and in developed
(rather than developing) countries. Sulfasalazine can
cause reversible infertility.
V.5. Answer b.
On the basis of the patient’s history, penetrating perianal disease, possibly with an enterovesical ﬁstula (pneumaturia), is suspected. External ﬁstula openings can be
difﬁcult to identify. MRI of the pelvis is the preferred
diagnostic modality for assessing perianal and pelvic
disease.

V.6. Answer b.
This patient has ileocolitis and arthralgias. Although
azathioprine is appropriate for steroid sparing, it will
not be as effective as methotrexate for the joint symptoms, which are more debilitating to him than the gastrointestinal symptoms. Methotrexate has been shown
to have steroid-sparing properties as well as an effect on
arthralgias. Cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors have been
shown to be safe short term for arthritis, but not long
term for arthralgias associated with inﬂammatory bowel
disease. 5-Aminosalicylic acid agents have no proven
steroid-sparing capacity. Budesonide has been shown to
be successful in tapering patients off prednisone, but it is
not effective in treating joint symptoms.
V.7. Answer d.
Controlled trials have demonstrated that remission can
be induced again by an anti-TNF agent in patients who
originally had a response to one of these agents; thus, it
is reasonable to switch to another anti-TNF agent. Starting azathioprine now will be too late for this patient,
who has lost response. Premedication helps to prevent
hypersensitivity reactions, but it does not help with loss
of response.
V.8. Answer b.
Studies have shown that if patients with severely active
ulcerative colitis do not demonstrate any response at all
to intravenous corticosteroid therapy after 3 days, there
is little chance of signiﬁcant improvement with continued therapy. Originally, cyclosporine was given at a dose
of 4 mg/kg intravenously over 24 hours, but controlled
data have shown equivalent efﬁcacy and few side effects
with a dose of 2 mg/kg intravenously. If inﬂiximab is to
be considered in this setting, the dose is 5 mg/kg intravenously. Azathioprine does have steroid-sparing properties but is not appropriate for steroid-refractory disease

255

256

Section V Colon

and takes too long to take effect to be helpful in a hospitalized patient.
V.9. Answer c.
Cyclosporine is used for active steroid-refractory
ulcerative colitis and has little role in the management
of Crohn’s disease. A low dose of 5-aminosalicylic acid
has not been shown to be superior to placebo to treat
active disease or to maintain remission. Trials with a
dose of 4 g have reported some success. Controlled
data with 6-mercaptopurine have demonstrated effectiveness in maintaining surgically induced remission
better than a high dose of 5-aminosalicylic acid or placebo. Short-term antibiotic therapy has been shown to
have some beneﬁt, but not long term. Methotrexate
has not been administered to patients postoperatively.
V.10. Answer d.
The patient requires long-term therapy to maintain
remission. Controlled trials have demonstrated that
doses of mesalamine 1.6 to 2.4 g/day are adequate for
maintaining remission. The patient, at this time, does
not require more aggressive therapy with an immunomodulator. The patient is asymptomatic and does not
require topical therapy with enemas and can continue
receiving oral therapy.
V.11. Answer c.
Antinuclear antibodies are frequently positive in
patients with Crohn’s disease treated with inﬂiximab,
but true drug-induced lupus is rare and is almost
always associated with antibodies to either doublestranded DNA or histones. If the arthralgias had worsened at the end of each inﬂiximab cycle and then
improved with treatment, incompletely treated disease
would have been the most likely answer. This patient
has a classic presentation for delayed hypersensitivity
reaction, with arthralgias occurring a week after each
infusion.
V.12. Answer c.
Most guidelines recommend that surveillance colonoscopy with biopsies begin 8 to 10 years after diagnosis in
patients with left-sided and extensive ulcerative colitis.
However, patients who have primary sclerosing cholangitis are at increased risk for colorectal dysplasia
and cancer and should be enrolled in yearly colonoscopic surveillance immediately. Because it has been
6 months since his last examination, he should return
in 6 months for the next procedure.
V.13. Answer b.
Most patients with inﬂammatory bowel disease who
have osteoporosis have one of the usual risk factors,
such as postmenopausal state, low body mass index, or
hypogonadism. Prolonged corticosteroid use and vitamin D deﬁciency are usual risk factors. Obesity is not a
risk factor for osteoporosis.

V.14. Answer b.
Erythema nodosum is typically a raised tender lesion
on the shins. Pyoderma gangrenosum ulcerates with
undermining borders and exhibits pathergy or a tendency to worsen with trauma. It has no pathognomonic histologic features. The course of pyoderma
gangrenosum is often independent of that of the
underlying inﬂammatory bowel disease. Inﬂiximab
and other anti-TNF agents have been shown to be
useful in healing pyoderma gangrenosum, and they are
not contraindicated in this setting.
V.15. Answer e.
Sulfasalazine and mesalamine have been associated
with, among others, interstitial nephritis, pancreatitis,
pneumonitis, and pericarditis. Cases of hypersensitivity colitis have been described with these drugs. However, these drugs have not been implicated as one of
the drugs associated with either collagenous or lymphocytic colitis.
V.16. Answer d.
The acute gastroenteritis in this patient most likely has
a viral cause. Caliciviruses, including Norovirus (also
known as Norwalk-like virus), are the most important
cause of viral gastroenteritis in adults. Contaminated
shellﬁsh, particularly oysters, is a well-recognized
source of Norovirus infection. The patient may feel ill
but appear quite well. Fecal leukocytes are typically not
present on stool analysis in cases of viral gastroenteritis. Rotavirus is a common cause of acute viral gastroenteritis in infants but is less common in adults. Vibrio
vulniﬁcus infection may cause a diarrheal illness in
patients with cirrhosis after ingestion of contaminated
shellﬁsh. The clinical presentation is less likely to be
due to Yersinia or Campylobacter infection.
V.17. Answer b.
The patient has a ﬁrst relapse of C difﬁcile infection, for
which a repeat course of metronidazole is the recommended therapy. If the patient had not had a response
to metronidazole initially, or this was a second relapse,
then treatment with vancomycin would be reasonable.
Cholestyramine can help decrease symptoms in mild
disease, but when used as monotherapy, results
have been disappointing. Rifaximin has been reported
to be useful in cases of refractory infection, after a
standard course of vancomycin. Saccharomyces boulardii may decrease the likelihood of recurrent C difﬁcile
infection but has not been proved effective as primary
monotherapy.
V.18. Answer d.
Bacteremia complicates nontyphoid salmonellosis in
8% of normal individuals. The risk is higher at the
extremes of age (<3 months or >65 years), with corticosteroid use, and in patients with inﬂammatory bowel
disease or other forms of immunosuppression. In these

Questions and Answers

circumstances antibiotic therapy is recommended.
The presence of an aortic aneurysm is also a risk factor
for persistent infection and is an indication for treatment independent of the aforementioned risk factors.
Oral antibiotic therapy is favored, and strict isolation
would not be deemed necessary for this patient.
V.19. Answer c.
The sudden onset of watery diarrhea with subsequent
development of bloody diarrhea and the presence of
fecal leukocytes suggest a bacterial cause for the clinical presentation. Campylobacter is a more common
cause of dysentery than Salmonella or E coli O157:H7.
Rotavirus and staphylococcal infections do not cause
bloody diarrhea.
V.20. Answer b.
This patient has a ﬁrst case of uncomplicated diverticulitis. Because he is tolerating oral intake without difﬁculty, outpatient management may be pursued. If the
patient had evidence of complication such as abscess
or was not able to tolerate oral intake, hospitalization
would be necessary. Because this is the patient’s ﬁrst
episode of diverticulitis and it is uncomplicated, surgery is not indicated. Colonoscopy is contraindicated
in the setting of acute diverticulitis. For this man, it
would be reasonable to perform colonoscopy 2 to 4
weeks after resolution of the acute symptoms, because
he has not had colon cancer screening previously.
V.21. Answer a.
Breast cancer incidence and mortality in hereditary
nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (Lynch syndrome) are
not increased above that of the general population.
V.22. Answer d.
Cowden syndrome is characterized by mucocutaneous
ﬁbromas, cutaneous tricholemmomas, prominent
forehead, and upper and lower gastrointestinal tract
hamartomas, most commonly juvenile polyps. Breast
cancers occur in up to 50% of those with germline
PTEN mutation. Both the uterine and thyroid cancer
risk is increased in this syndrome. In contrast to juvenile polyposis, the gastrointestinal cancer risk does not
appear to be increased in Cowden syndrome. Thus,
PTEN testing is important to direct surveillance and
kindred screening.
V.23. Answer b.
Osteomas are essentially always benign and rarely
symptomatic.
V.24. Answer e.
Breast cancer occurs in 50% of women with PeutzJeghers syndrome, compared with a 40% risk for colorectal cancer, 40% risk for gastroduodenal cancer,
35% risk for pancreatic cancer, and 20% risk for ovarian cancer.

257

V.25. Answer e.
Carcinoid tumors are the most common gastrointestinal tract endocrine tumor, and the most common
intestinal carcinoid tumors are located in the appendix. Appendiceal carcinoids are usually asymptomatic
and found incidentally at operation. Of appendiceal
carcinoids, 98% are solitary, benign, and smaller than
1 cm. Appendectomy is considered curative for all
appendiceal carcinoids smaller than 2 cm. If an appendiceal carcinoid is larger than 2 cm or if there is evidence of malignancy and possible invasion, right
hemicolectomy is recommended.
V.26. Answer a.
This patient meets the criteria for irritable bowel syndrome. Initial management should be noninvasive and
symptom driven.
V.27. Answer b.
This patient has features of pelvic ﬂoor dysfunction.
Testing, such as an anorectal manometry with balloon
expulsion, is needed.
V.28. Answer c.
True colonic inertia is rare, but such patients are best
served by colectomy with ileorectal anastomosis. The
key points are 1) the absence of pelvic ﬂoor dysfunction, 2) slow colon transit with normal upper gut transit, and 3) lack of response to therapy. The medical
option may still exist, but when the patient’s condition
is refractory to medical options, surgery needs to be
considered.
V.29. Answer d.
This patient does not meet the criteria for irritable
bowel syndrome. Celiac disease is high on the list of
possibilities. The rash may reﬂect dermatitis herpetiformis. Evaluation with antibody testing and, if positive, small-bowel biopsy is indicated. If the results of
these tests suggest the diagnosis of celiac disease, a gluten-free diet is recommended.
V.30. Answer e.
The constant nature of the pain and the changes with
movement raise the question of pain arising outside
the gastrointestinal tract, and the abdominal wall is a
possible site.
V.31. Answer b.
After a secondary cause for constipation has been
excluded, colonic transit and anorectal functions
should be assessed when constipation does not respond
to simple measures. Patients with slow-transit constipation unresponsive to laxatives and without pelvic
ﬂoor dysfunction may require subtotal colectomy.
V.32. Answer b.
A digital rectal examination is very useful in identifying defecatory disorders. Although clinical features are

258

Section V Colon

helpful, the evidence suggests that anorectal testing is
necessary to conﬁrm or exclude defecatory disorders.
A rectal balloon expulsion test is highly sensitive and
speciﬁc for identifying defecatory disorders. Because
up to 20% of healthy subjects have dyssynergia detected
on anorectal manometry, this ﬁnding cannot be interpreted in isolation but in context with clinical features
and the results of other tests. Barium or magnetic resonance proctography should be considered when a
structural disorder (eg, a clinically signiﬁcant rectocele) is suspected, when there is discrepancy between
the results of anorectal manometry and the rectal balloon expulsion test, or when there is discrepancy
between the clinical impression and the results of these
tests.
V.33. Answer c.
The sympathetic nervous system inhibits gastrointestinal and colonic motor activity via adrenergic α2
receptors.
V.34. Answer b.
Stool frequency does not reﬂect colonic transit.
V.35. Answer e.
Colchicine and misoprostol generally should not be
used to manage constipation because they are associated with potentially signiﬁcant adverse effects, including neuromyopathy for colchicine and pronounced
bloating for misoprostol.
V.36. Answer d.
A pregnant patient with appropriate indications should
undergo endoscopy. This patient has evidence of active
bleeding of the gastrointestinal tract that may require
therapeutic intervention. It would be inappropriate to
admit and observe or to start antisecretory therapy
alone. Endoscopy in a controlled setting with midazolam for comfort would be appropriate. Surgical consultation without endoscopy is premature.
V.37. Answer c.
Most women with hepatitis C do not require treatment
during pregnancy. The toxicity of interferon warrants

careful consideration of its beneﬁts because most
women will not experience liver failure or the decompensation of hepatitis during pregnancy. Ribavirin is
absolutely contraindicated during pregnancy. It would
be inappropriate to recommend therapeutic termination on the basis of a positive serologic test. Lamivudine
is not used in the treatment of hepatitis C infection.
V.38. Answer d.
Inﬂiximab is a category B drug, and although it crosses
the placenta, it does not do so readily until early in the
third trimester. Maintaining remission is the most
important way to minimize an adverse birth outcome.
Because the patient is doing well with inﬂiximab therapy, there is no reason to increase the dose or to switch
to corticosteroids. There is no evidence that the development of antibodies to any biologic occurs more
often in a pregnant patient than in a nonpregnant
one; thus, the initiation of azathioprine therapy is
unnecessary.
V.39. Answer b.
Constipation is common in pregnancy, particularly in
the third trimester. A patient with underlying irritable
bowel syndrome–constipation may experience even
more symptoms than a healthy control. The ﬁrst-line
therapy after ﬁber to treat constipation is polyethylene
glycol. Castor oil has been associated with uterine rupture and should not be used. Mineral oil will not help
with increasing stool frequency. Dietary restrictions
for constipation during pregnancy are not appropriate. Senna may lead to worse cramping and bloating.
V.40. Answer d.
Many women experience heartburn during pregnancy,
especially in the second and third trimesters. Proton
pump inhibitors are low risk and effective in controlling heartburn symptoms when over-the-counter antacids and histamine blockers fail. Without red ﬂag
signs, endoscopy is not warranted and empiric therapy
is appropriate. Prokinetics are unlikely to be as helpful
as proton pump inhibitor therapy.

Approach to the Patient With Abnormal Liver
Tests and Acute Liver Failure
John J. Poterucha, MD

This chapter includes the following topics:
1. General discussion of commonly used liver tests
2. Differential diagnosis and discussion of diseases characterized by an increase in hepatocellular enzyme levels
3. Differential diagnosis and discussion of diseases characterized by an increase in cholestatic enzyme levels
4. Evaluation of patients who have jaundice
5. Diagnostic algorithms for evaluating patients who have
abnormal liver tests
6. Management of patients who have acute liver failure

Commonly Used Liver Testsa
Aminotransferases (Alanine and Aspartate
Aminotransferases)

The aminotransferases (also referred to as transaminases) are
located in hepatocytes and, thus, are markers of liver cell injury
(hepatocellular disease). Injury of the hepatocyte membrane
allows these enzymes to “leak” out of hepatocytes, and within
a few hours after liver injury, the serum levels of the enzymes
increase. Aminotransferases consist of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST). ALT is
relatively speciﬁc for liver injury, whereas AST is found not
only in hepatocytes but also in skeletal and cardiac muscle
and in other organs. ALT has a longer half-life than AST;
thus, improvements in ALT levels lag behind those of AST.

Abbreviations: ALT, alanine aminotransferase; AST, aspartate aminotransferase; ERCP, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography; MRCP, magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography

Marked muscle injury can produce striking increases in AST
levels and, to a lesser extent, in ALT levels.
Alkaline Phosphatase

Alkaline phosphatase is an enzyme located on the hepatocyte
membrane bordering bile canaliculi. Because alkaline phosphatase is found also in bone and placenta, an increase in its
level without other indication of liver disease should prompt
further testing to discover if the increase is from liver or other
tissues. One way of doing this is to determine the concentration of alkaline phosphatase isoenzymes. Another way is to
determine the level of γ-glutamyltransferase, an enzyme of
intrahepatic biliary canaliculi. Other than to conﬁrm the liver
origin of an increased level of alkaline phosphatase,
γ-glutamyltransferase is of little use in the evaluation of diseases of the liver because its synthesis can be induced by many
medications, thus decreasing its speciﬁcity for clinically
important liver disease.
Bilirubin

Bilirubin is the water-insoluble product of heme metabolism
that is taken up by hepatocytes and conjugated with glucuronic
acid to form monoglucuronides and diglucuronides.
Conjugation makes bilirubin water-soluble, allowing it to be
excreted in bile. The serum concentration of bilirubin is measured in direct (conjugated) and indirect (unconjugated)
fractions. Diseases characterized by overproduction of bilirubin, such as hemolysis or resorption of a hematoma, are
characterized by hyperbilirubinemia that is 20% or less conjugated bilirubin. Hepatocyte dysfunction or impaired bile
ﬂow produces hyperbilirubinemia that is usually 20% to 80%
or more conjugated bilirubin. Patients with an inherited

261

262

Section VI Liver

disorder of bilirubin excretion into the canaliculus, such as
Dubin-Johnson syndrome or Rotor’s syndrome, have hyperbilirubinemia that is more than 80% conjugated. Because conjugated bilirubin is water-soluble and may be excreted in
urine, patients with conjugated hyperbilirubinemia may note
dark urine. In these patients, the stools are lighter in color
because of the absence of bilirubin pigments.
Prothrombin Time and Albumin

Prothrombin time and serum albumin are commonly used
markers of liver synthetic function. Abnormalities of prothrombin time and albumin imply severe liver disease and
should prompt immediate evaluation. Prothrombin time
is a measure of the activity of factors II, V, VII, and X, all of
which are synthesized in the liver. These factors are dependent
also on vitamin K for synthesis. Vitamin K deﬁciency may be
produced by antibiotics, prolonged fasting, small-bowel
mucosal disorders such as celiac disease, or severe cholestasis
with an inability to absorb fat-soluble vitamins. Hepatocellular
dysfunction is characterized by an inability to synthesize clotting factors despite adequate stores of vitamin K. A simple way
to differentiate vitamin K deﬁciency from hepatocellular dysfunction in a patient with a prolonged prothrombin time is to
administer vitamin K. Administration of vitamin K improves
prothrombin time within 2 days in a vitamin K-deﬁcient
patient but has little effect if the prolonged prothrombin time
is due to liver disease with poor synthetic function.
Because albumin has a half-life of 21 days, decreases due to
liver dysfunction do not occur acutely; however, the serum
level of albumin can decrease relatively quickly in a patient
who has a severe systemic illness such as bacteremia. This
rapid decrease likely is caused by the release of cytokines,
which accelerate the metabolism of albumin. Other causes of
hypoalbuminemia include urinary or gastrointestinal tract
losses, and these should be considered in a patient who has
hypoalbuminemia but not overt liver disease.

most often in patients with preexisting cardiac dysfunction.
Aminotransferase levels increase quickly and improve within
a few days. Another cause of a transient increase in aminotransferase levels is an acute increase in intrabiliary pressure
that usually is due to a common bile duct stone. These increases
can be as high as 1,000 U/L, but the levels decrease dramatically within 24 to 48 hours. In patients with pancreatitis, a
transient increase in AST or ALT is suggestive of gallstone
pancreatitis. Alcoholic hepatitis is characterized by more
modest increases in aminotransferase levels, nearly always less
than 400 U/L, with an AST:ALT ratio greater than 2:1. Patients
with alcoholic hepatitis frequently have an increase in bilirubin level out of proportion to the increase in aminotransferase
levels.
Diseases that produce sustained (>3 months) increases in
aminotransferase levels are included in the category of chronic
hepatitis. The increase in aminotransferase levels generally is
more modest (1.5–5 times the upper limit of normal) than
that in acute hepatitis. Although patients may be asymptomatic, they occasionally complain of fatigue and right upper
quadrant pain. The most important and common disorders
that cause chronic hepatitis are listed in Table 22.2.

Hepatocellular Disorders

Diseases that affect primarily hepatocytes are characterized
predominantly by increased levels of aminotransferases. The
disorders are best categorized as acute (generally <3 months)
or chronic. Acute hepatitis may be accompanied by malaise,
anorexia, abdominal pain, and jaundice. Common causes of
acute hepatitis are listed in Table 22.1.
The pattern of increase in aminotransferase levels may be
helpful in making a diagnosis. Acute hepatitis caused by
viruses or drugs usually produces a marked increase in the
levels of aminotransferases, often more than 1,000 U/L.
Generally, ALT increases more than AST. Aminotransferase
levels more than 5,000 U/L usually are due to acetaminophen
hepatotoxicity, ischemic hepatitis (“shock liver”), or hepatitis
caused by unusual viruses, such as herpesvirus. Ischemic
hepatitis occurs after an episode of hypotension and is seen

22 Approach to the Patient With Abnormal Liver Tests and Acute Liver Failure

Risk factors for hepatitis C include a history of intravenous
drug use or exposure to blood products. Most patients with
hepatitis B are from an endemic area such as parts of Asia or
Africa or have a history of illegal drug use or multiple sexual
contacts. Patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease are usually obese and have diabetes mellitus or hyperlipidemia. A
complete history is needed to help diagnose drug-induced or
alcohol-induced liver disease. Autoimmune hepatitis may
manifest as acute or chronic hepatitis. Patients usually have an
ALT serum level of 200 to 800 U/L, higher than that in other
disorders that cause chronic hepatitis. Autoantibodies, hypergammaglobulinemia, and other autoimmune disorders are
helpful clues to the diagnosis of autoimmune hepatitis.

263

obstruction from a stone may produce marked increases in
aminotransferase levels. Intrahepatic mass lesions should be
considered if a patient has an increased level of alkaline phosphatase and a history of malignancy. Inﬁltrative disorders
such as amyloidosis, sarcoidosis, or lymphoma may produce a
markedly increased alkaline phosphatase level with a normal
bilirubin concentration. Any systemic inﬂammatory process
such as infection or immune disorder may produce nonspeciﬁc liver test abnormalities. The abnormalities usually are a
mixed cholestatic (alkaline phosphatase) and hepatocellular
(ALT or AST) pattern.

Jaundice
Cholestatic Disorders

Diseases that affect predominantly the biliary system are
termed cholestatic diseases. These can affect the microscopic
ducts (eg, primary biliary cirrhosis), large bile ducts (eg,
pancreatic cancer obstructing the common bile duct), or both
(eg, primary sclerosing cholangitis). In these disorders, the
predominant abnormality is generally the alkaline phosphatase
level. Although diseases that produce increased bilirubin levels
are often called “cholestatic,” it is important to remember that
severe hepatocellular injury, as in acute hepatitis, also produces hyperbilirubinemia because of hepatocellular dysfunction. Causes of cholestasis are listed in Table 22.3.
Primary biliary cirrhosis usually occurs in women and can
cause fatigue or pruritus. Of patients with primary sclerosing
cholangitis, 70% to 80% also have ulcerative colitis. Patients
with primary biliary cirrhosis or primary sclerosing cholangitis often are asymptomatic but may have jaundice, fatigue, or
pruritus. Large bile duct obstruction often is due to stones or
benign or malignant strictures. Remember that acute bile duct

Jaundice is visibly evident hyperbilirubinemia and occurs
when the bilirubin concentration is more than 2.5 mg/dL. A
common disorder that produces unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia (but not usually jaundice) is Gilbert’s syndrome.
Total bilirubin is generally less than 3.0 mg/dL, whereas direct
bilirubin is 0.3 mg/dL or less. The level of bilirubin usually is
highest when a patient is ill or fasting. A presumptive diagnosis of Gilbert’s syndrome can be made in an otherwise well
patient who has unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, normal
liver enzyme values, and a normal concentration of hemoglobin (to exclude hemolysis).
Patients with direct hyperbilirubinemia can be categorized
as those with a nonobstructive condition and those with an
obstructive condition. Abdominal pain, fever, or a palpable
gallbladder (or a combination of these) is suggestive of
obstruction. Risk factors for viral hepatitis, recent ingestion of
a potentially hepatotoxic drug, bilirubin concentration more
than 15 mg/dL, and persistently high aminotransferase levels
suggest that the jaundice is due to hepatocellular dysfunction.
In patients with resolving acute hepatitis, improvement in
bilirubin concentration often lags behind the improvement in
aminotransferase levels. In diseases resulting in large bile duct
obstruction, extrahepatic and intrahepatic biliary dilatation
can be identiﬁed on imaging studies, especially if the bilirubin
concentration is more than 10 mg/dL and the patient has had
jaundice for more than 2 weeks. Acute large bile duct obstruction, usually from a stone, may not cause dilatation of the bile
ducts, and if the clinical suspicion is strong for bile duct
obstruction despite normal-sized bile ducts seen on ultrasonography or computed tomography, the biliary tree should
be imaged with endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP), or endoscopic ultrasonography.

General Approach to Abnormal Liver Tests

When a patient has abnormal liver tests at presentation, it is
helpful to classify the patient’s condition as one of the clinical
syndromes listed in Table 22.4, although the overlap among
these categories is considerable. Patients with acute hepatitis

264

Section VI Liver

Table 22.4
Abnormal Liver Tests: Clinical Syndromes

“First-time” increase in liver enzymes
Acute hepatitis
Chronic hepatitis
Cholestasis without hepatitis or jaundice
Jaundice
Cirrhosis or portal hypertension

or cirrhosis often have jaundice. The approach to patients
with acute hepatitis, chronic hepatitis, cholestasis, and jaundice is outlined above. Patients with a “ﬁrst-time,” often incidental, increase in liver enzyme levels are usually asymptomatic.
As long as 1) no risk factors for liver disease are identiﬁed, 2)
liver enzyme levels are less than three times normal, 3) liver
function is preserved, and 4) the patient feels well, observation
is reasonable, with the test repeated in a few months. If the
repeat test results are still abnormal, the patient’s condition
ﬁts the category of chronic hepatitis or cholestasis and appropriate evaluation should be initiated. A similar approach can
be taken for patients with incidentally discovered abnormal
liver tests who are taking medications that only rarely cause
liver disease.
Patients also may present with cirrhosis or portal hypertension. Most patients with portal hypertension have cirrhosis,

although occasionally patients present with noncirrhotic
portal hypertension that is idiopathic or due to portal vein
thrombosis. The evaluation of a patient with cirrhosis is similar to that of a patient with chronic hepatitis and cholestasis
(as shown above). Alpha1-antitrypsin deﬁciency, genetic
hemochromatosis, alcoholic liver disease, and nonalcoholic
fatty liver disease frequently have cirrhosis as the ﬁrst manifestation of liver disease. If a patient has clinical and imaging features that strongly suggest cirrhosis, conﬁrmatory liver biopsy
is not necessary.

Algorithms for Evaluating Patients With
Abnormal Liver Tests

Algorithms for evaluating patients who have abnormal liver
tests are, at best, guidelines, and, at worst, misleading. Always
remember that in evaluating (or not evaluating) abnormal
liver tests, the patient’s clinical presentation should be considered. Generally, a patient with liver test abnormalities that are
less than twice normal may be followed as long as the patient
is asymptomatic and the albumin level, prothrombin time,
and bilirubin concentration are normal. Also, persistent
abnormalities should be evaluated. Algorithms for evaluating
increased levels of ALT, alkaline phosphatase, and conjugated
bilirubin are shown in Figures 22.1 to 22.3.

Section VI Liver

Identiﬁcation of a viral cause of acute liver failure has implications for other patients who have been exposed to the transmissible agent. The US Acute Liver Failure Study Group has
coordinated the effort of several centers that have attempted
to better deﬁne the causes and outcome of acute liver failure in
the United States. The most common identiﬁable causes are
acetaminophen hepatotoxicity, idiosyncratic drug reactions,
Wilson’s disease, hepatitis B, and ischemia (Fig. 22.4).
The presenting symptoms of acute liver failure are usually
those of acute hepatitis, including malaise, nausea, and jaundice. Hepatic encephalopathy is a required feature of the syndrome, and manifestations may range from subtle mental
status changes, such as difﬁculty with concentration, to coma
(Table 22.5). Because encephalopathy in a patient with acute
liver disease is an ominous sign, the mental status of patients
with acute hepatitis should be assessed frequently. Laboratory
features are consistent with severe liver dysfunction. Aminotransferase levels are variably increased, although they usually
are more than 1,000 U/L. Fulminant Wilson’s disease is
characterized by only modest increases in aminotransferase
levels and a normal or only minimally increased alkaline
phosphatase level despite clinical evidence of liver failure,
such as a prolonged prothrombin time and high bilirubin
concentration.
The encephalopathy associated with acute liver failure is
different from that of chronic liver disease in the propensity of
encephalopathy of acute liver disease to progress to cerebral
edema. The mechanisms for the development of cerebral

Management of Acute Liver Failure

Traditionally, fulminant liver failure has been deﬁned as the
presence of acute liver failure, including the development of
hepatic encephalopathy, within 8 weeks after the onset of
jaundice in a patient without a previous history of liver disease. Because not all patients with severe acute liver disease
meet this strict deﬁnition, some authors have proposed the
term acute liver failure, which encompasses other clinical scenarios, including fulminant liver failure. About 2,000 cases of
acute liver failure occur annually in the United States. The
overall mortality rate of acute liver failure without liver transplantation is high. Because many of the patients are young and
previously healthy, a poor outcome of this relatively unusual
condition is particularly tragic.
Determining the cause of acute liver failure is important
for two reasons: 1) speciﬁc therapy may be available, as for
acetaminophen hepatotoxicity or herpes hepatitis, and 2) the
prognosis differs depending on the cause. For instance, the
spontaneous recovery rate for acute liver failure due to acetaminophen or hepatitis A is more than 50%; consequently, a
more cautious approach would be advised before proceeding
with liver transplantation. In comparison, spontaneous recovery from acute liver failure due to Wilson’s disease is unusual
and early liver transplantation would be recommended. Also,
identifying a speciﬁc cause may have implications for other
patients. The identiﬁcation of a hepatotoxic agent is helpful in
monitoring other patients receiving the same drug treatment.

edema have not been clariﬁed but may involve disruption of
the blood-brain barrier and interference with mechanisms of
cellular osmolarity. Clinically, the encephalopathy often is
associated with a marked increase in the serum level of ammonia, although alterations in unidentiﬁed neurotransmitters
likely are involved in causing mental status changes.
Cerebral edema is estimated to cause about 20% of deaths
of patients with acute liver failure. Cerebral edema leads to
death by causing brain ischemia and cerebral herniation.
Infections are another common cause of death of patients with
acute liver failure. Reasons for the infections are multiple but
likely reﬂect severe illness and the need for numerous interventions and monitoring. The clinical features typical of infection, such as fever and leukocytosis, may not occur in patients
with acute liver failure and a high index of suspicion for infection needs to be maintained. Any clinical deterioration should
mandate a search for infection, and the threshold for antimicrobial therapy should be low.
Hypoglycemia is a frequent manifestation of acute liver
failure, and the glucose level should be monitored carefully in
all patients. The hypoglycemia is likely due to both inadequate
degradation of insulin and diminished production of glucose
by the diseased liver.
A hyperdynamic circulation and decrease in systemic vascular resistance frequently accompany acute liver failure.
These features may be well tolerated by patients, but occasionally hemodynamic compromise can develop. Monitoring
parameters may mimic sepsis. Fluid resuscitation usually is
necessary, although caution is advised because the administration of excessive ﬂuid may worsen intracranial pressure.
Renal and electrolyte abnormalities occur because of
underlying disease such as Wilson’s disease, functional renal
failure due to sepsis or hepatorenal syndrome, or acute tubular necrosis. Renal dysfunction is particularly common in
acetaminophen-induced acute liver failure. Monitoring of
electrolytes, including sodium, potassium, bicarbonate, magnesium, and phosphorus, is important, and the presence of
acidosis is a risk factor for poor outcome in acute liver failure
and has been incorporated into prognostic models.
Models to predict outcome of acute liver failure have
been developed to facilitate optimal timing of liver transplantation before the patient becomes so ill that transplantation is

contraindicated, yet still allow time for spontaneous recovery.
The most well known and widely used model is the King’s
College criteria (Table 22.6). Liver transplantation likely
improves mortality, although improved outcomes have been
assessed only by comparison with historical controls.
The appearance of encephalopathy precedes cerebral
edema; therefore, patients with acute hepatitis and evidence of
liver failure need to be monitored carefully for mental status
changes. Patients with encephalopathy should receive lactulose, although this agent is not as effective in acute liver failure
as in chronic liver disease and may not prevent cerebral edema
from developing later. Patients with stage II encephalopathy
usually are admitted to an intensive care unit for close monitoring of mental status and vital signs. Sedatives should be
avoided initially to allow close monitoring of mental status.
Also, at most centers, computed tomography of the head is
performed to exclude an alternative cause of mental status
changes.
Patients who reach stage III encephalopathy are at considerable risk for progression to cerebral edema. Because clinical
signs and computed tomography are insensitive for detecting
increased intracranial pressure, many centers institute intracranial pressure monitoring when patients reach stage III
encephalopathy. Endotracheal intubation and mechanical
ventilation usually precede placement of the intracranial pressure monitor. Various such monitors are used, all of which
can be complicated by infection and bleeding. The goal of
intracranial pressure monitoring is to allow treatment of high
pressure and also to identify which patient is too ill for liver
transplantation because of a prolonged period of excessively
high intracranial pressure. Generally, the goal is to maintain
intracranial pressure less than 40 mm Hg and cerebral perfusion pressure (the difference between mean arterial pressure
and intracranial pressure) between 60 and 100 mm Hg.
Excessively high cerebral perfusion pressures (>120 mm Hg)
can increase cerebral edema.
Maneuvers that cause straining, including tracheal suctioning, should be avoided or limited. Paralyzing agents and
sedatives may be necessary, although they may limit further

268

Section VI Liver

assessment of neurologic status. For intracranial pressure
more than 20 mm Hg or cerebral perfusion pressure less than
60 mm Hg, elevation of the head to 20 degrees, hyperventilation to a Paco2 of 25 mm Hg, and mannitol (if renal function
is intact) are advised. Barbiturate-induced coma can be used
for refractory cases. A prolonged increase in intracranial pressure above mean arterial pressure may signify brain death and
generally is a contraindication to liver transplantation. A
sudden decrease in intracranial pressure may indicate brain
herniation.
In patients with acute liver failure, the prolonged prothrombin time is a simple noninvasive measure to follow, and
coagulopathy is not corrected unless there is bleeding or an
intervention such as placement of a monitoring device is
planned. If bleeding occurs or an invasive procedure is necessary, fresh frozen plasma usually is administered ﬁrst, although
platelets and ﬁbrinogen may be necessary in certain circumstances. Continuous infusion of 5% or 10% dextrose is used to
keep the plasma glucose level between 100 and 200 mg/dL.
The plasma glucose level should be monitored at least twice
daily. Both bacteremia and fungemia are sufﬁciently frequent
that periodic blood cultures are advised and prophylaxis with
antimicrobials may be initiated, although this practice has not
been shown to affect survival.
Acute liver failure is the indication for 6% of liver transplants
in the United States. Even though survival with transplantation
for acute liver failure is lower than that for transplantation for
other indications, outcomes are an improvement over the
dismal survival rates for patients with acute liver failure who
meet poor prognostic markers such as the King’s College
criteria. Transplantation should be performed when a poor
outcome is anticipated, yet before the patient has uncontrolled

sepsis or prolonged periods of increased intracranial pressure
that prevent recovery even with a functioning transplanted
liver.

Chronic Viral Hepatitis
John J. Poterucha, MD

Viral infections are important causes of liver disease worldwide. The ﬁve primary hepatitis viruses that have been identiﬁed are A, B, C, D (or delta), and E. Other viruses such as
cytomegalovirus and Epstein-Barr virus also can result in hepatitis as part of a systemic infection. In addition, medications,
toxins, autoimmune hepatitis, or Wilson’s disease may cause
acute or chronic hepatitis.
It is useful to divide hepatitis syndromes into acute and
chronic forms. Acute hepatitis can last from weeks up to
6 months and is often accompanied by jaundice. Symptoms
of acute hepatitis tend to be similar regardless of cause and
include anorexia, malaise, dark urine, fever, and mild abdominal pain. In chronic hepatitis, patients are often asymptomatic but may complain of fatigue. Occasionally, they have
manifestations of advanced liver disease (ascites, variceal
bleeding, or encephalopathy) as the initial presentation of
chronic hepatitis. Each hepatitis virus causes acute hepatitis,
but only hepatitis B, C, and D viruses can cause chronic
hepatitis.
The purpose of this chapter is to review the primary hepatitis viruses. A more comprehensive discussion of acute hepatitis is found in other chapters. The four common hepatitis
viruses are compared in Table 23.1, and the disease burden of
the three most important viruses in the United States is summarized in Table 23.2.

Epidemiology

The incidence of acute hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection is
decreasing in the United States. Common routes of transmission

Section VI Liver

of HAV are ingestion of contaminated food or water and contact
with an infected person. Groups at particularly high risk include
people living in or traveling to underdeveloped countries, children in day care centers, homosexual men, and perhaps persons
who ingest raw shellﬁsh. Outbreaks of HAV infection in communities are recognized frequently, although an exact source may
not be found. The incubation period for HAV is 2 to 6 weeks.

also to travelers to areas with an intermediate or high prevalence of hepatitis A, men who have sex with men, intravenous
drug users, recipients of clotting factor concentrates, and
patients with chronic liver disease. Widespread vaccination of
health care workers or food handlers has not been advised.

Hepatitis B
Clinical Presentation and Natural History
Epidemiology

The most important determinant of the severity of acute hepatitis A is the age at which infection occurs. Persons infected
when younger than 6 years have nonspeciﬁc symptoms that
rarely include jaundice. Adolescents or adults who acquire
HAV infection usually have jaundice. Hepatitis A is almost
always a self-limited infection. There may be a prolonged
cholestatic phase characterized by persistence of jaundice for
up to 6 months. Rarely, acute hepatitis A manifests as acute
liver failure that may require liver transplantation. HAV does
not cause chronic infection and should not be in the differential diagnosis of chronic hepatitis.
Diagnostic Tests

The diagnosis of acute hepatitis A is established by the presence of IgM hepatitis A antibody (anti-HAV), which appears
at the onset of the acute phase of the illness and disappears in
3 to 6 months. The IgG anti-HAV also becomes positive
during the acute phase, but it persists for decades and is a
marker of immunity from further infection. A patient with
IgG anti-HAV, but not IgM anti-HAV, has had an infection in
the remote past or has been vaccinated.
Treatment and Prevention

The treatment of acute hepatitis A is supportive. Immune
serum globulin should be administered to all household and
intimate (including day care) contacts within 2 weeks after
exposure. Postexposure vaccination is also advised. Immunization with hepatitis A vaccine is recommended for all children at 12 months of age. Hepatitis A vaccine should be offered

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a DNA virus that causes about 30%
of cases of acute viral hepatitis and 15% of cases of chronic
viral hepatitis in the United States. Most chronically infected
persons in the United States are immigrants from Asia and
Africa, where infection is acquired at the time of birth or in
early childhood. Major risk factors for adult disease acquisition in the United States are sexual promiscuity and intravenous drug use.
Diagnostic Tests

A brief guide to serologic markers for hepatitis B is provided
in Table 23.3. The interpretation of serologic patterns is found
in Table 23.4. The best serologic test for acute hepatitis B is

IgM antibody to hepatitis B core (anti-HBc). Occasionally, a
patient with acute hepatitis B (usually with a severe presentation such as acute liver failure) lacks hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and has only IgM anti-HBc as the marker for
recent infection. Patients with an acute ﬂare of chronic hepatitis B may redevelop IgM anti-HBc.
Most patients with HBsAg have detectable HBV DNA in
serum. HBV DNA levels greater than 104 IU/mL generally are
considered to indicate active viral replication. Any detectable
level in patients with cirrhosis is clinically important.
Occasionally, patients have IgG anti-HBc as the only positive hepatitis B serologic marker. A common explanation in a
population without risk factors for disease acquisition is a
false-positive test (although the test is often repeatedly positive). Another explanation is a previous, resolved HBV infection in which the antibody to hepatitis B surface (anti-HBs)
has decreased below the limit of detection. This can be documented indirectly by demonstrating an anamnestic type of
response to hepatitis B vaccine. Rarely, patients with hepatitis
B may have HBsAg levels that are below the level of detection,
so that IgG anti-HBc is the only marker of infection. Although
the signiﬁcance of this low-level infection is unclear, these
patients can be identiﬁed by the presence of HBV DNA in
serum or liver.
The accuracy of serologic and nucleic acid tests obviates the
need for liver biopsy in the diagnosis of hepatitis B; however,
liver biopsy is useful for grading inﬂammatory activity and
determining the stage of ﬁbrosis. Histologic features of hepatitis B are inﬂammation that is usually around the portal tract,
variable ﬁbrosis that initially is also portocentric, and the presence of ground-glass hepatocytes. Ground-glass hepatocytes
are hepatocytes with cytoplasm that has a hazy, eosinophilic
appearance. With immunostaining, these cells are positive for
HBsAg (Fig. 23.1). Even though liver biopsy is the “gold standard” for diagnosing cirrhosis, it generally is not necessary for
patients who have other features of cirrhosis, such as portal
hypertension.
Clinical Presentation and Natural History

The incubation period after HBV infection ranges from 30 to
160 days, and the clinical outcome varies. Acute hepatitis B in
an adolescent or adult is icteric in about 30% of cases. Complete
recovery with subsequent life-long immunity occurs in 95% of
infected adults. About 5% of infected adults have persistence
of HBsAg for longer than 6 months and are referred to as
chronically infected. Immunosuppressed persons with acute
HBV infection are more likely to become chronically infected,
presumably because of an insufﬁcient immune response
against the virus.
Patients with chronic hepatitis B infection may present in
one of four phases (Fig. 23.2). An immune tolerant phase is
recognized in many Asian patients who are infected perinatally. This phase is characterized by the presence of hepatitis B
e antigen (HBeAg) and very high HBV DNA levels, yet normal
levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT). Generally, liver

staining of hepatocyte cytoplasm.

biopsy specimens from these patients show minimal changes
except for ground-glass hepatocytes. The immune tolerant
phase can last up to the age of 40 years and generally evolves
under immune pressure into the HBeAg-positive chronic
hepatitis B phase, characterized by increased ALT levels, the
presence of HBeAg, and more than 104 IU/mL of HBV DNA.
During this phase, active inﬂammation and often ﬁbrosis
are seen in liver biopsy specimens, indicating progressive
liver injury. At a rate of about 10% per year, patients mount
enough of an immune response to achieve a decrease in ALT
levels, clearance of HBeAg and development of antibody to
hepatitis B e (anti-HBe) (seroconversion), and a decrease in
HBV DNA to less than 104 IU/mL. The resulting inactive carrier phase usually is not accompanied by progressive liver
damage. In cross-sectional studies, about 60% of patients with
chronic hepatitis B are in the inactive carrier phase. Many
patients remain in this phase for many years and have a better
prognosis than those with active liver inﬂammation and viral
replication.

WR, Poterucha JJ. Natural history of hepatitis B virus infection: an update for clinicians. Mayo Clin Proc. 2007 Aug;82[8]:967–75. Used with
permission of Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research.)

About one-third of inactive carriers have a reactivation of
chronic hepatitis characterized by abnormal ALT levels and
HBV DNA of more than 104 IU/mL. This may be associated
with a reversion to the HBeAg-positive state, but more commonly it is due to a precore or core promoter variant. This
HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B phase is associated with
progression of liver damage. Patients with HBeAg-negative
chronic hepatitis B are more likely to have lower DNA levels
and a ﬂuctuating course than patients with HBeAg-positive
chronic hepatitis B. Also, the patients generally are older and
have more advanced ﬁbrosis because HBeAg-negative chronic
hepatitis B tends to occur later in the course of infection.
Patients with chronic hepatitis B may experience spontaneous ﬂares of disease characterized by markedly abnormal ALT
levels, deterioration in liver function, and often seroconversion of HBeAg. The differential diagnosis for acute hepatitis in
patients with chronic hepatitis B is listed in Table 23.5. Because
disease activity changes in patients with chronic hepatitis B,
even after years of senescence, periodic monitoring with liver
tests and hepatitis B markers is necessary. HBsAg clears spontaneously in about 1% of chronically infected patients annually, although this rate is lower in endemic areas where HBV is
acquired at a very young age.
Overall, about 15% to 40% of patients with chronic HBV
infection develop serious sequelae of the disease, either decompensated liver disease or hepatocellular carcinoma. Factors
associated with the development of cirrhosis are older age;
infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV), human immunodeﬁciency virus (HIV), or hepatitis D virus (HDV); genotype C;

longer duration of infection; high HBV DNA levels; and alcohol abuse. Many of these factors, including HBV DNA level,
are associated also with an increased risk for the development
of hepatocellular carcinoma.
Patients with chronic hepatitis B and cirrhosis are at high
risk for the development of hepatocellular carcinoma, and
surveillance every 6 to 12 months is advised. Surveillance also
is advised for patients without cirrhosis who meet one of the
following criteria: family history of hepatocellular carcinoma,

23 Chronic Viral Hepatitis

Asian male older than 40 years, Asian female older than
50 years, black African older than 20 years, and persistent
increase in ALT level together with an HBV DNA value of
more than 104 IU/mL. The method of surveillance can vary
among centers, but many use ultrasonography with or without alpha fetoprotein at 6-month intervals.
Eight hepatitis B genotypes, labeled A through H, have
been identiﬁed, and the genotype for a patient is determined
largely by the country in which infection is acquired. All genotypes have been identiﬁed in the United States. In Asian
patients, genotype B has a better prognosis than genotype C,
including a higher rate of clearance of HBeAg, a slower rate of
progression to cirrhosis, and a lower likelihood of the development of hepatocellular cancer. Genotypes A and B have a
better response to peginterferon therapy than other genotypes,
and genotyping should be considered if peginterferon treatment of hepatitis B is contemplated.
Treatment

Generally, hepatitis B is treated if the patient is at risk for disease progression. This includes patients in the HBeAg-positive
or HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B phases. Patients with
compensated cirrhosis should be treated if the HBV DNA level
is more than 2,000 IU/mL, and patients with decompensated
cirrhosis should be treated if there is any detectable HBV
level.
Pretreatment liver biopsy is not necessary for all patients
but can be helpful in patients who otherwise do not meet clear
criteria for treatment. Liver biopsy also can be used to diagnose advanced ﬁbrosis, which could mandate a change in
management, such as evaluation for esophageal varices or surveillance for hepatocellular carcinoma.
Hepatitis B can be treated with peginterferon or one of the
oral agents (lamivudine, adefovir, entecavir, telbivudine, or
tenofovir). Peginterferon has replaced standard interferon
because of once-weekly dosing and perhaps better efﬁcacy.
One year of treatment generally is advised. Seroconversion
may occur months or even years after completion of treatment.
Predictors of a greater likelihood of response to peginterferon

include higher ALT level, lower HBV DNA level, shorter duration of disease, genotype A or B, and female sex. Patients
treated with peginterferon may experience a ﬂare of hepatitis
(likely due to immune system activation) about 4 to 8 weeks
after beginning treatment. Treatment should be continued
despite this ﬂare unless there is clinical or biochemical evidence of decompensation. Patients with Child-Pugh class B or
C cirrhosis should not be treated with interferons because of
the risk of precipitating decompensation with this ﬂare.
Adverse effects of peginterferon are common and are considered below (Hepatitis C).
The oral agents are the drugs prescribed most frequently
for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B. They are compared in
Table 23.6. These drugs are well tolerated. The oral agents are
useful particularly in patients with decompensated cirrhosis,
because these drugs may improve liver function. The ﬂare of
hepatitis that may occur during interferon therapy is unusual
with the oral agents. Treatment with lamivudine or telbivudine is complicated by resistant mutations at a rate of about
10% to 15% per year. Resistance to adefovir occurs at a rate of
about 1% to 4% per year. Resistance to entecavir is uncommon unless the patient has previously developed resistance to
lamivudine, although data for long-term treatment are needed.
Clinical resistance to tenofovir has not yet been described.
Because of their lower rates of resistance, tenofovir and entecavir are now considered the oral agents of choice. About 15%
to 20% of HBeAg-positive patients treated with oral agents have
seroconversion to anti-HBe positive after 1 to 2 years of therapy;
treatment should be continued for at least 6 months after
seroconversion. Patients without seroconversion of HBeAg
need to continue treatment indeﬁnitely. Seroconversion of
HBsAg with the oral agents is unusual; therefore, most patients
with HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis will require prolonged
or even indeﬁnite therapy.
The choice of therapeutic agent for hepatitis B depends on
several factors. As noted above, only active hepatitis should be
treated. Peginterferon is reasonable for patients without cirrhosis who have an ALT level greater than 200 U/L and who
are able to tolerate the numerous adverse effects of the drug.
Peginterferon is most effective against hepatitis B genotypes

Section VI Liver

A and B; thus, genotyping is advised in patients for whom
peginterferon therapy is being considered. Entecavir or tenofovir are preferred for patients who have cirrhosis. For patients
who have severely decompensated cirrhosis, tenofovir is
preferred because of reports that lactic acidosis occurs
when these patients are treated with entecavir. Oral agents are
preferred also for patients who are immunosuppressed,
for example, after organ transplantation or infection with
HIV. Patients who are HBsAg positive and need chemotherapy or immunosuppression are at risk for disease ﬂare, and
treatment with one of the oral agents is advised during therapy
and for at least 6 months after therapy has been completed.
Patients with isolated anti-HBc positivity are also at risk,
although the risk is signiﬁcantly smaller than for those who are
HBsAg positive. Monitoring of ALT and HBV DNA levels
during immunosuppression therapy generally is advised, and
treatment with oral agents should be given if HBV DNA
becomes detectable.
For patients with end-stage liver disease or hepatocellular
carcinoma due to hepatitis B, liver transplantation is advised.
Patients with hepatitis B who have HBeAg or high HBV DNA
levels (or both) before liver transplantation are at particularly
high risk for recurrence after transplantation. For these
patients, oral agents are recommended before transplantation
and a combination of hepatitis B immunoglobulin and an
oral agent after transplantation. Even in patients without
active viral replication, recurrence rates are sufﬁciently high
that both preoperative and postoperative therapy with one of
the oral agents is still given by most transplant groups.
Prevention

Hepatitis B immunoglobulin should be given to household
and sexual contacts of patients with acute hepatitis B. All
infants should receive hepatitis B vaccine. The marker of
immunity is anti-HBs. Neonates often acquire hepatitis B
perinatally if the mother is infected; therefore, HBsAg testing
should be performed on all pregnant women. Infants born
to HBsAg-positive women should receive both hepatitis B
immunoglobulin and hepatitis B vaccine. In addition,
oral agents can be administered during the third trimester
to pregnant women who have HBV DNA levels higher than
107 IU/mL.

Hepatitis C

HCV is the cause of the most common chronic blood-borne
infection in the United States. It has been estimated that 3 to
4 million Americans are infected with the virus; about 70% of
them have abnormal ALT levels. Although the number of new
cases of HCV infection is decreasing, the number of deaths has
continued to increase because of the propensity of the virus to
cause chronic infection. HCV is a factor in 40% of all cases of
chronic liver disease and is the leading indication for liver
transplantation.
Diagnostic Tests

Antibodies to HCV (anti-HCV) indicate exposure to the virus
and are not protective. The presence of anti-HCV can indicate
either current infection or a previous infection with subsequent clearance. Even after clearance of the infection, only
about 10% of patients lose anti-HCV. The presence of antiHCV in a patient who has an abnormal ALT level and risk
factors for acquiring hepatitis C is strongly suggestive of current HCV infection.The “gold standard” for the diagnosis of
hepatitis C infection is the presence of HCV RNA in serum as
determined with polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Most reference laboratories are able to reproducibly perform this HCV
RNA assay with a sensitivity limit of 10 to 50 IU/mL. HCV
RNA by PCR is now the preferred next test (bypassing antiHCV by recombinant immunoblot assay) for patients with
abnormal liver enzyme levels or for those at high risk for HCV
infection who are found to be anti-HCV–positive by enzymelinked immunoassay. A guide to the interpretation of antiHCV tests is provided in Table 23.7.
The determination of HCV genotype is helpful in assessing
the likelihood of treatment response. Patients with HCV genotype 1 (which comprises about 70% of US patients) or 4 are
less likely to have a response to therapy than those with genotype 2 or 3. Levels of HCV RNA do not correlate with disease
severity or prognosis, and the major use of quantitative assays
is to stratify response to therapy. Patients with viral levels
higher than 600,000 IU/mL are less likely to have a response to
treatment than those with lower HCV RNA levels. Liver biopsy
is not necessary for the diagnosis of hepatitis C, but it is helpful
in assessing the severity of disease for prognostication and in
making decisions about treatment and screening. Typical biopsy
ﬁndings include a mononuclear (predominantly lymphocytic)

Hepatitis D

HDV (or the delta agent) is a defective virus that requires the
presence of HBsAg to replicate. HDV infection can occur
simultaneously with HBV (coinfection) or as a superinfection
in persons with established hepatitis B. Hepatitis D is diagnosed by antibodies to HDV (anti-HDV) and should be suspected if a patient has acute hepatitis B or an acute exacerbation
of chronic hepatitis B. In the United States, intravenous drug
users are the group of HBV patients at highest risk for acquiring HDV.

Clinical Presentation and Natural History

The incubation period of HCV ranges from 2 to 23 weeks
(mean, 7.5 weeks). Infection with HCV rarely presents clinically as acute hepatitis, although retrospective studies have
suggested that 10% to 20% of patients have an icteric illness
with acute infection. Of those who acquire hepatitis C, 60% to
85% develop chronic infection (Fig. 23.4). Once chronic infection has been established, subsequent spontaneous loss of the
virus is rare. Consequently, most patients with hepatitis C

present with chronic hepatitis, with a mild-to-moderate
increase in ALT levels. For patients with abnormal ALT levels,
the degree of increase correlates poorly with the histologic
severity of disease. Some patients have fatigue or vague right
upper quadrant pain (or both). Patients also may come to
attention because of complications of end-stage liver disease
or, rarely, extrahepatic complications such as cryoglobulinemia or porphyria cutanea tarda. Patients with hepatitis
C-associated cryoglobulinemia usually have a vasculitic rash
of the lower extremities, but they also may have a membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis or polyneuropathy. The
cryoglobulinemia and its associated complications usually
respond to the treatment of hepatitis C. Porphyria cutanea
tarda is manifested as a rash on sun-exposed areas, particularly the back of the hands. Many patients also have abnormal
iron test results. The response of porphyria cutanea tarda to
anti-hepatitis C therapy is more uncertain than the response
of cryoglobulinemia. Phlebotomy improves the rash of porphyria cutanea tarda.
Up to 30% of patients chronically infected with HCV have
a persistently normal level of ALT. Although these patients as
a group generally have less aggressive histologic features and a
lower risk of disease progression than do patients with hepatitis C and abnormal ALT levels, it is recommended that patients
with a normal ALT level be managed similarly to those who
have an abnormal ALT level.
Nearly all mortality and most morbidity associated with
hepatitis C are due to cirrhosis. About 20% to 30% of patients
with chronic hepatitis C develop cirrhosis over a 20-year
period (Fig. 23.4). Multiple factors have been studied to identify the subgroup of patients likely to develop progressive liver
disease. Important factors are duration of infection, alcohol

intake of more than 50 g daily, steatosis, coinfection with HIV
or HBV, and male sex. Patients with cirrhosis due to HCV
generally have had the disease longer than 20 years.
An important predictive factor for the development of cirrhosis is the severity of the histologic features of the liver at
presentation. Histologic specimens need to be interpreted
with knowledge of the duration of infection (if known).
Patients who have only mild portal hepatitis without ﬁbrosis
despite 20 years of infection have a signiﬁcantly lower risk of
progression to cirrhosis than those who have more active disease with a similar duration of infection. Histologic markers
of more active disease include moderate degrees of inﬂammation and necrosis and the presence of periportal or septal
ﬁbrosis. Liver biopsy is performed in most patients being considered for treatment of hepatitis C to assist in decisions about
treatment.
Treatment

Treatment is indicated for patients who are at highest risk for
the development of cirrhosis: an anticipated long duration of
hepatitis C, a history of alcohol use, or active disease with at
least periportal ﬁbrosis seen in liver biopsy specimens. Patients
who have compensated cirrhosis due to hepatitis C should be
offered treatment; those who have decompensated disease
should be referred for liver transplantation. Patients who have a
high probability of having a response to treatment, such as
those with genotype 2 or 3, may be considered candidates for
treatment regardless of liver biopsy ﬁndings. Thus, biopsy is not
always necessary before treatment. Knowing whether the patient
has cirrhosis is necessary for monitoring for the development of
esophageal varices and hepatocellular carcinoma. For patients
with clear evidence of portal hypertension, biopsy is not needed
to conﬁrm cirrhosis. Therapy also should be offered to patients
who have extrahepatic manifestations of hepatitis C, such as
vasculitis related to cryoglobulinemia. In addition, patients who
have an anticipated long lifespan, for example, those younger
than 50 years, might be offered treatment independently of liver
biopsy ﬁndings or genotype. Treatment may be indicated to
reduce potential transmission, for example, a health care worker
who performs invasive procedures.
Currently, peginterferon in combination with ribavirin is
the standard of care for patients with hepatitis C who are
deemed candidates for treatment. This combination therapy,
given for 6 to 12 months, results in a sustained clearance of
HCV RNA from serum in about 55% of patients. Baseline
variables associated with a sustained response to combination
therapy include HCV genotype 2 or 3, HCV RNA levels less
than 800,000 IU/mL, no or only portal ﬁbrosis, female sex,
and age younger than 40 years. Patients who receive at least
80% of the planned dose of peginterferon and ribavirin for the
duration of therapy are more likely to have a response.
Adherence to therapy is particularly important for harder-totreat patients, such as those with genotype 1.
Recent data have shown that single nucleotide polymorphisms in the region of the IL28B gene on chromosome 19,

coding for interferon lambda, are strongly associated with
treatment response in patients with genotype 1 treated with
peginterferon and ribavirin. The CC genotype for the IL-28
subtype, which is near the interferon response gene, is a favorable factor for response, in comparison with the TT genotype.
Patients with the CT genotype have intermediate rates of
response. The IL28B gene partially accounts for the lower
response rates observed in African American patients. Testing
for the IL-28 genotype has not yet been incorporated into
clinical practice, and its role in determining responses to newer
hepatitis C treatment regimens is awaited.
HCV genotype and viral level should be determined before
treatment is initiated. When treating patients who have genotype 1 or 4, the HCV RNA level should be determined after
12 weeks of therapy (Fig. 23.5). Patients who do not achieve a
2 log10 decrease in HCV RNA level from the pretreatment
value have a very low rate of sustained response, and treatment may be discontinued. Those who have a 2 log10 decrease
(or are HCV RNA-negative) at 12 weeks should continue to
receive treatment, with the HCV RNA level determined at
24 weeks. Those who are HCV RNA-positive at 24 weeks will
not achieve a sustained response, and treatment can be
stopped. Patients who are HCV RNA-negative at 24 weeks
should complete a total of 48 weeks of treatment. Some reports
have suggested that patients who are HCV RNA-negative at
24 weeks but were HCV RNA-positive at 12 weeks have a
greater sustained response rate with 72 weeks of therapy than
with 48 weeks of therapy, but this has not been incorporated
routinely into clinical practice.
Patients with genotype 2 or 3 have a high rate of response,
and determining the HCV RNA level at 12 weeks probably is
not cost-effective (Fig. 23.6). If therapy is tolerated poorly and
a decision needs to be made about continuing therapy, the
12-week stop rule described for genotype 1 may be applied.
Otherwise, treatment should be continued for a total of
24 weeks, although patients who are HCV RNA-negative after
4 weeks of therapy have good response rates even with only
12 or 16 weeks of treatment.
The most troublesome side effects of hepatitis C therapy
are hematologic and neuropsychiatric. Anemia is the most
common reason for prematurely discontinuing hepatitis C
combination therapy. Ribavirin causes a dose-dependent,
reversible hemolysis that is evident within 4 weeks after treatment is initiated. Peginterferon, because of its bone-marrowsuppressive effects, interferes with erythropoiesis that may
otherwise compensate for the ribavirin-induced hemolysis.
Fatigue, dyspnea, or symptoms of cardiovascular disease may
accompany anemia. Because ribavirin-induced hemolysis is
dose-dependent, dose reduction usually improves the hemoglobin level, but perhaps at the expense of treatment efﬁcacy.
Erythropoietin has been used to maintain hemoglobin
levels (and therefore ribavirin doses) in patients treated for
hepatitis C. Whether erythropoietin-induced improvements
in hemoglobin level and ribavirin dosing will lead to improved
hepatitis C response rates, compared with decreasing the ribavirin dose, has not been demonstrated. Currently, guidelines

Section VI Liver

suggest that decreasing the ribavirin dose should be the ﬁrst
response to clinically important anemia. Patient age, symptoms associated with anemia, and risk factors for or presence
of cardiovascular disease are considered when determining
when anemia is sufﬁcient to warrant a change in the dose of
ribavirin.
Neutropenia that occurs during hepatitis C therapy is
due to peginterferon. An absolute neutrophil count less than
500 cells/mL is unusual and serious infections are rare except
in patients with other risk factors for infection, for example,
decompensated cirrhosis. Consequently, neutropenia seldom
requires intervention in patients receiving hepatitis C therapy.
Most neuropsychiatric side effects of hepatitis C therapy
are due to peginterferon, although anemia and other adverse
effects of ribavirin may potentiate symptoms. The prevalence
of neuropsychiatric side effects among patients with hepatitis
C is high even before treatment, and baseline mood status may
inﬂuence the likelihood of dose-limiting neuropsychiatric
manifestations of interferon. Pretreatment education for
patients and family members about the potential for these
adverse effects is critical for ensuring adherence to treatment.
Reassurance is also important because many patients are able
to cope with the neuropsychiatric manifestations by understanding that they are related to treatment and will resolve
once treatment has been discontinued. Nevertheless, 30% of
patients treated for HCV infection require the introduction or
addition of medications such as selective serotonin reuptake
inhibitors (SSRIs) for the treatment of these adverse effects.
Patients who develop suicidal ideation while receiving
treatment should discontinue therapy. For patients with notable depression without suicidal ideation, an SSRI such as citalopram can be prescribed. For patients with a prominent
anxiety or irritability component of depression, agents such as
paroxetine, ﬂuvoxamine, or mirtazapine may be helpful.
Mirtazapine is also useful for patients who have considerable
weight loss with interferon therapy. Fluoxetine, sertraline,
venlafaxine, and bupropion are more activating and, thus,
may be preferred for patients who have fatigue or cognitive
slowing, although fatigue without other symptoms of depression does not respond well to antidepressant therapy.
Patients who are not candidates for treatment should be
evaluated annually with routine liver tests. For those with
early-stage disease, a repeat liver biopsy in 3 to 5 years may be
indicated to assess for histologic progression. Magnetic resonance elastography or ultrasound transient elastography are
not widely available but offer potential for noninvasive serial
measurements of ﬁbrosis. Patients with biopsy-proven or
clinically apparent advanced ﬁbrosis or cirrhosis are at
increased risk for hepatocellular carcinoma. The risk of hepatocellular carcinoma complicating hepatitis C with cirrhosis is
1.4% to 4% per year. Screening using liver imaging such as
ultrasonography, computed tomography, or magnetic resonance imaging, every 6 to 12 months is advised for patients
with cirrhosis who are candidates for treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma with liver transplantation, liver resection, or
percutaneous ablation.

Patients with hepatitis C and decompensated cirrhosis
(including those with hepatocellular carcinoma) should be
considered for liver transplantation. For patients who received
a liver transplant for hepatitis C, posttransplant viremia is
nearly universal and histologic changes in the allograft due to
recurrent disease are common. Nevertheless, the survival rate
is good, and hepatitis C is the leading indication for liver
transplantation in the United States.
Prevention

No vaccine is available for hepatitis C. Transmission by needlestick injury is unusual, although monitoring after inadvertent
exposure is advised. Baseline anti-HCV testing with subsequent
determination of the HCV RNA level 4 weeks after exposure is
recommended. Antiviral therapy is more effective for acute
hepatitis C than for chronic hepatitis C. For patients with documented acute hepatitis C, the current recommendation is
3 months of observation to allow for spontaneous resolution. If
there is no spontaneous resolution, then treatment is initiated.
Perinatal transmission of HCV occurs in about 5% of
infants born to infected mothers. Rates are highest if the
mother has high HCV RNA levels, for example, those coinfected with HCV and HIV. Maternally derived anti-HCV may
be found in the neonate for up to 18 months after birth, thus
limiting the usefulness of serologic assays for diagnosis;
instead, HCV RNA testing should be used.
For patients infected with HCV, blood donation is prohibited. Precaution needs to be taken when caring for open sores
of HCV-infected patients. Sexual transmission is unusual, but
condoms are advised for those with multiple sex partners. For
patients in a monogamous long-term relationship, the partner
should be tested and the couple counseled about the possibility of transmission. The decision about the use of condoms is
left to the infected person and partner.
Hepatitis E

Hepatitis E causes large outbreaks of acute hepatitis in underdeveloped countries. Rarely, a patient may acquire hepatitis E
without a history of travel to endemic areas. Clinically, hepatitis E virus infection is similar to HAV infection. Resolution of
the hepatitis is the rule, and chronic infection does not occur.
Women who acquire hepatitis E during pregnancy may present with fulminant liver failure.
Viral Hepatitis and Human
Immunodeﬁciency Virus

Because of shared risk factors, patients with viral hepatitis are
also at risk for infection with HIV. About 10% to 15% of HIVinfected patients are HBsAg positive. Patients with HIV infection are at increased risk for remaining chronically infected
after the acute HBV infection, compared with HIV-negative
patients. HIV-infected patients with HBV infection have

23 Chronic Viral Hepatitis

higher HBV DNA levels and increased liver mortality than
HBV patients without HIV infection.
The response to treatment for HBV infection with interferon in HIV-infected patients is low, and treatment with oral
agents generally is advised. The combination of tenofovir and
emtricitabine has an antiviral effect on both HIV and HBV
and is often used. For the rare patient who requires treatment
for HBV but not HIV, lamivudine, entecavir, or tenofovir
should not be given as monotherapy because of the risk of
resistance developing to later treatment of HIV disease.
About 45% of HIV-infected patients are infected with
HCV. Compared with HCV-infected patients without HIV
infection, HCV/HIV-infected patients have higher HCV RNA
levels, an increased risk of vertical and sexual transmission of
HCV, an increased risk of cirrhosis, and an increased risk of
hepatocellular carcinoma. Patients with HCV/HIV should be
considered for treatment. The HIV disease should be controlled, and treatment generally is recommended only if the
HIV level is less than 1,000 copies/mL and the CD4 count
more than 200/mL. The patient should have no recent opportunistic infections, and most physicians advocate liver biopsy
before treatment. Patients with stage 0 or 1 ﬁbrosis generally
can be observed unless they are HCV genotype 2 or 3, in which
case most patients will receive treatment.
The doses used to treat hepatitis C in HCV/HIV-infected
patients are similar to those used for treating HCV infection in
patients without HIV infection. Twelve months of treatment
is better than 6 months, even for patients with HCV genotype
2 or 3. Three-month and 6-month “stop” rules are used to

279

help identify nonresponders. Erythropoietin and antidepressants are often necessary to maintain dosing.

Clinical Approach to Liver Mass Lesionsa
Lewis R. Roberts, MB, ChB, PhD

The clinical approach to liver mass lesions requires attention to
the clinical context within which the mass is identiﬁed, the
symptoms of the patient, and the physical examination, laboratory tests, and imaging studies. With the advent of frequent
ultrasonographic or cross-sectional imaging of the abdomen
for various abdominal symptoms, many liver mass lesions are
now discovered incidentally during imaging performed for
unrelated symptoms. It is important to evaluate fully these incidentally discovered lesions because a signiﬁcant proportion of
them represent malignant or premalignant disease that requires
appropriate management. This chapter describes the overall
approach to the evaluation and diagnosis of liver mass lesions
and summarizes the clinical features and management of the
most common benign and malignant liver masses (Table 24.1).

History

It is important to obtain a history of potential risk factors for
different types of liver masses to inform the subsequent evaluation and to limit unnecessary testing. The age and sex of the

patient, a history of oral contraceptive use, geographic residence and travel history, and comorbid illnesses often provide
important clues to the diagnosis. A history of previous imaging studies should always be sought because information
about whether the mass is new, previously seen, and stable in
size or enlarging over time can be highly valuable in the differential diagnosis of liver masses.
Pain can be an important presenting symptom. A rapidly
enlarging liver mass tends to distend the liver capsule and
cause right upper quadrant abdominal pain, whereas a slowly
281

282

Section VI Liver

growing mass can reach a substantial size that almost completely occupies the liver without causing noticeable symptoms.
It may come to attention only when the mass becomes a visible
abdominal protuberance (Fig. 24.1). Pain associated with
tumor growth is usually dull, relatively diffuse, and persistent.
It may or may not be associated with tenderness in the epigastrium and right upper quadrant of the abdomen. Subcapsular
lesions, whether benign or malignant, frequently cause a pleuritic pain syndrome of abdominal pain accompanied by right
shoulder discomfort exacerbated by breathing. In particular,
lesions that have the propensity for intralesional rupture or
hemorrhage can ﬁrst appear as the sudden onset of severe
abdominal pain. This is most typical of benign hepatic adenomas or hepatocellular carcinomas, which characteristically

A

are extremely vascular. If the rupture involves the liver capsule, it can be associated with life-threatening intra-abdominal
hemoperitoneum, shock, and risk of exsanguination.
A history of an underlying liver disease that predisposes to
malignancy is often an important diagnostic clue. Patients with
viral, alcoholic, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, autoimmune,
metabolic, or other causes of cirrhosis are at increased risk for
the development of hepatocellular carcinoma. These patients
may have had complications of cirrhosis, including ascites,
spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, bleeding esophageal varices,
or hepatic encephalopathy. In addition, patients with longstanding chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection are at risk
for hepatocellular carcinoma even in the absence of cirrhosis.
Consequently, current recommendations are for patients with
cirrhosis of any cause or who acquired chronic HBV infection
at birth or in early life to be entered into a regular program of
surveillance with liver ultrasonography, with or without serum
alpha fetoprotein measurements, every 6 months. Persons
born in sub-Saharan Africa should be enrolled in a surveillance program beginning at age 20 years; for those born in
Asia, surveillance should be initiated at age 40 years for men
and 50 years for women (Fig. 24.2). Persons with a family history of hepatocellular carcinoma, those with high HBV viral
loads (HBV DNA >2,000 IU/mL), or those with a persistent or
intermittent increase in the level of alanine aminotransferase
should also have regular surveillance.
Primary sclerosing cholangitis, which can be subclinical in
patients with ulcerative colitis or other inﬂammatory bowel
disease, is a major risk factor for cholangiocarcinoma. A history
of sudden hepatic decompensation, cholangitis, or the development of a new dominant stricture in a patient with known
primary sclerosing cholangitis can presage the development of

24 Clinical Approach to Liver Mass Lesions

cholangiocarcinoma. More than half of the cholangiocarcinomas that occur in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis
will be diagnosed within 2 years after the initial diagnosis of
primary sclerosing cholangitis; therefore, this should be a
period of heightened surveillance.
General, nonspeciﬁc symptoms associated with malignancy
include fatigue, loss of appetite, unintended weight loss, lowgrade fever, and night sweats. A recent history of iron deﬁciency anemia should raise suspicion of colorectal cancer with
liver metastases; a long-standing history of gastroesophageal
reﬂux and new-onset dysphagia should prompt consideration
of esophageal adenocarcinoma; the recent onset of diabetes
mellitus should elicit a search for pancreatic adenocarcinoma;
and a history of breast cancer should be sought and the breasts
should be examined and imaged to rule out metastatic breast
cancer. In the absence of other localizing symptoms, occult
lymphoma should be considered.
Various paraneoplastic syndromes can be helpful in the
diagnosis of liver masses. A history of ﬂushing, hypotension,
and diarrhea is classic for metastatic neuroendocrine tumors
such as carcinoids. Diarrhea alone occurs most frequently
with hepatocellular carcinoma as a consequence of the secretion of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide and gastrin by the
tumor. Also, hepatocellular carcinomas can be associated with
hypoglycemia and erythrocytosis.
Physical Examination

The physical examination may provide clues to the underlying
cause of a liver mass. Most frequently, patients have stigmata
of chronic liver disease, including temporal muscle wasting,
spider angiomas, palmar erythema, ascites, splenomegaly, and
a caput medusa from recanalization of the umbilical vein. The
cirrhotic liver may be palpably nodular and often associated
with bilobar enlargement of the liver or isolated hypertrophy
of the caudate lobe. Large liver masses may give rise to palpable hepatomegaly, and subcapsular masses may be palpable if
located anteriorly or inferiorly in the liver. Abdominal lymphadenopathy or peritoneal carcinomatosis may be palpable.
Tumors may have associated tenderness in the epigastrium or
right upper quadrant of the abdomen. Vascular masses such as
primary hepatocellular carcinomas may have an audible vascular bruit on auscultation. Pallor may be due to anemia from
colon adenocarcinoma with chronic blood loss or from anemia
of chronic disease related to other malignancies. Jaundice
may be due to advanced chronic liver disease or to biliary
obstruction from cholangiocarcinoma. Peripheral edema may
be associated speciﬁcally with chronic liver disease, with tense
ascites causing compression of the inferior vena cava and
loss of intravascular oncotic pressure due to hypoalbuminemia, or it may be nonspeciﬁc, due to general debility.
Frequently, cancer is associated with an acute phase response
syndrome, and because albumin is a negative acute phase
reactant, a cancer-associated hypoalbuminemia typically contributes to peripheral edema. Many cancers are associated
with a prothrombotic tendency; consequently, it is important

283

to evaluate new-onset lower extremity edema, particularly if it
is unilateral, for deep vein thrombosis.
Laboratory Tests

Laboratory tests often provide evidence of chronic liver disease or of the underlying tumor that is metastatic to the liver.
A complete blood count may show thrombocytopenia from
chronic liver disease with splenomegaly, or it may show
anemia from gastrointestinal blood loss related to colon or
other primary gastrointestinal cancer. Typically, aspartate
aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase levels are
increased in active inﬂammatory liver disease or from neoplastic diseases inﬁltrating the liver. An increase in the bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase concentrations usually reﬂects
bile duct obstruction from a primary biliary tumor or it may
be due to mass effect from an intrahepatic mass or from
enlarged lymph nodes in the porta hepatis. The serum level of
albumin is often low and the prothrombin time increased in
patients with cirrhosis. Tests that identify the speciﬁc cause,
such as viral markers (anti-hepatitis C virus [HCV] antibody
or polymerase chain reaction for HCV RNA, hepatitis B surface antigen, anti-HB core antibody, and anti-HB surface antibody), can be useful. Iron levels typically are increased in
patients with hereditary hemochromatosis and low in those
with anemia from colon cancer-related gastrointestinal blood
loss. Tumor markers such as carcinoembryonic antigen for
colon cancer, carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9), and alpha
fetoprotein are helpful if positive, but they frequently are negative in patients with early-stage cancer. Also, these markers
are not entirely speciﬁc for the primary site. For example, the
carcinoembryonic antigen level often is increased in cholangiocarcinomas and pancreatic cancers, and the alpha fetoprotein level can be increased in patients with primary cancers of
the upper gastrointestinal tract outside the liver, such as
esophageal adenocarcinoma. Primary hepatic lymphomas or
secondary lymphoma metastases can masquerade as primary
liver cancers; the serum level of lactate dehydrogenase usually
is increased and can be an important clue to the diagnosis. The
urine 24-hour 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid concentration is
helpful in cases of suspected carcinoid syndrome.
Imaging Studies

The imaging studies most frequently helpful in the differential
diagnosis of liver mass lesions include abdominal ultrasonography, cross-sectional imaging modalities such as computed
tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI),
and various nuclear imaging studies, including tagged red cell
studies (for cavernous hemangiomas), technetium 99m sulfur
colloid imaging (to distinguish focal nodular hyperplasias
from adenomas), positron emission tomography (PET), and
fused PET-CT (most useful for imaging metastatic disease).
More specialized contrast agents are becoming available, particularly for MRI. For example, a newer paramagnetic MRI contrast agent, gadobenate dimeglumine (MultiHance), undergoes

biliary as well as renal excretion and behaves as a nonspeciﬁc
gadolinium chelate in the ﬁrst minutes after administration
and as a liver-targeted agent in later delayed phases; this allows
further delineation of lesion characteristics in MRI scans
obtained 60 to 120 minutes after the injection of contrast and
can be particularly helpful in distinguishing between focal
nodular hyperplasias and adenomas.

A

Benign Liver Masses
Cavernous Hemangioma

Cavernous hemangiomas are the most common benign liver
tumors, occurring in 7% of adults in autopsy series. They are
seen predominantly in women, with a 1.5-5:1 female-to-male
predominance, being diagnosed most frequently in multiparous women in their third to ﬁfth decades. Cavernous hemangiomas are multicentric in up to 30% of cases and frequently
coexist with focal nodular hyperplasias.

B

Histologic Features

Cavernous hemangiomas are characterized by an extensive
network of vascular spaces lined by endothelial cells and separated by thin, ﬁbrous stroma. Large hemangiomas may have
areas of thrombosis, scarring, and calciﬁcation.
Clinical Features

Hemangiomas are most often asymptomatic. Large, subcapsular hemangiomas may cause abdominal pain or discomfort.
Giant hemangiomas (>10 cm) may cause systemic features of
inﬂammation such as fever, weight loss, and anemia. KasabachMerritt syndrome may occur with disseminated intravascular
coagulation, most commonly in children. Cavernous hemangiomas do not undergo malignant transformation, and rupture is exceedingly rare.
Imaging Characteristics

Ultrasonography—On ultrasonography, hemangiomas are
well-circumscribed, homogeneously hyperechoic lesions with
smooth margins.
Dynamic contrast-enhanced multiphasic CT—On CT, there
is peripheral nodular enhancement during the arterial phase,
with later ﬁll-in toward the center of the lesion (Fig. 24.3).
MRI with gadolinium contrast—Hemangiomas are typically homogeneous, with low signal intensity on T1-weighted
images and sharply demarcated, hyperintense lesions on
T2-weighted images. Similar to other contrast imaging studies, there is peripheral enhancement in the arterial phase, with
later ﬁll-in toward the center of the lesion.
Technetium 99m-labeled red blood cell scintigraphy—This
can be used to conﬁrm the diagnosis in lesions that are atypical on other imaging studies. There is low perfusion on early

cavernous hemangiomas). B, Fill-in toward the center of the lesions

toward the center of the masses, with almost complete enhancement
of the two small hemangiomas).

images, and the isotope gradually accumulates to a high concentration within the lesion on late images.
Biopsy

Biopsy seldom is needed. It may be useful for small lesions
that show uniform enhancement and resemble primary
tumors or metastases and also for large lesions that have pronounced scarring and atypical imaging features. Biopsy specimens typically are a relatively acellular “dry aspirate,” with
occasional vascular elements seen on histologic study.
Management

Most cavernous hemangiomas do not require intervention
and can be observed. Symptomatic giant cavernous hemangiomas require surgical enucleation or resection.

24 Clinical Approach to Liver Mass Lesions

Hepatic Adenoma

Hepatic adenomas are benign tumors of the liver that occur
predominantly in young women between the third and fourth
decades of life. Hepatic adenoma is associated signiﬁcantly
with long-term use of oral contraceptive pills. The estimated
relative risk is 2.5 times greater for women who have taken
oral contraceptive pills for 3 to 5 years than for women who
have taken them for 1 year or less. After 5 years of oral contraceptive use, the risk increases at a faster rate to 25 times greater
after 9 or more years of use. Hepatic adenomas also occur in a
familial pattern associated with diabetes mellitus, in patients
with glycogen storage disease type 1A or 3, and in persons who
take the androgenic hormones methandrostenolone and
methyltestosterone. Adenomas are usually single, but they
may be multiple, especially in patients with glycogen storage
disease. The tumors may decrease in size after withdrawal of
oral contraceptives, but they usually do not; sometimes they
increase in size. An important feature of hepatic adenomas is
that they can undergo malignant transformation, although
this seems to be relatively unusual. Recent evidence suggests
that adenomas that stain positive for increased cytoplasmic or
nuclear β-catenin are more likely to transform to hepatocellular carcinoma.

285

differentiated from focal nodular hyperplasias in the delayed
phase after MRI with gadobenate dimeglumine or gadoxetate
disodium, in which adenomas show decreased retention of
the contrast when compared with the surrounding liver
(Fig. 24.4).

A

B

Histologic Features

Adenomas are characterized by the presence of sheets of hepatocytes without bile ductules, ﬁbrous septa, portal tracts, or
central veins.
Clinical Features

Hepatic adenomas are most often asymptomatic. Patients may
present with pain or discomfort of the upper abdomen or the
right upper quadrant of the abdomen. Because these tumors
have a propensity to rupture, patients may present with intrahepatic hemorrhage and pain or with hemoperitoneum and
shock.

C

Imaging Characteristics

Adenomas frequently have nonspeciﬁc imaging characteristics. Most often, they are heterogeneous because of the presence of intralesional necrosis or hemorrhage, but frequently
are homogeneous when small. The tumors typically take up
contrast rapidly in the arterial phase of contrast CT or MRI
studies and then almost immediately become isointense with
the surrounding liver in the portal phase. If contrast studies
are not timed optimally, this important imaging feature may
be missed. Adenomas often cannot be differentiated deﬁnitively from hepatocellular carcinoma or hypervascular metastases with ultrasonography, CT, or MRI. On technetium 99m
sulfur colloid scintigraphy, there usually is no uptake because
adenomas do not contain Kupffer cells. Adenomas can be

phase, the adenoma excludes contrast and is hypoenhancing
compared with the surrounding liver.

286

Section VI Liver

Biopsy

Because of the frequent uncertainty about the diagnosis after a
thorough noninvasive evaluation, biopsy often is required for
diagnosis.
Management

Resection is the treatment of choice because of the risk of rupture and associated malignancy. Patients generally are advised
to discontinue the use of oral contraceptive pills. Most experts
advise against pregnancy until the lesion can be resected,
although the evidence that pregnancy is associated with a
higher rate of complications is scant. Small adenomas that are
in a location in the liver that renders them technically difﬁcult
to resect can be treated with radiofrequency ablation. Also,
observation can be considered for smaller adenomas or for
those that regress after withdrawal of estrogen, particularly in
patients who do not plan any future pregnancies.
Focal Nodular Hyperplasia

Focal nodular hyperplasia is thought to develop as a reaction
of the liver to an intrahepatic arterial malformation. The arterial malformation forms a vascular stellate scar that contains
connective tissue and bile ductules. The surrounding mass
contains a proliferation of hepatocytes separated by ﬁbrous
septa. Focal nodular hyperplasia occurs predominantly in
women of childbearing age. The relationship to oral contraceptive use is debated, but some studies have suggested an
association with long-term use. The tumor may be multiple
(10% of patients) or associated with cavernous hemangiomas
(20% of patients).
Histologic Features

Focal nodular hyperplasia is characterized by benignappearing hepatic parenchyma, with bile ductules in septal
ﬁbrosis.

contrast enhancement during the arterial phase and isointensity during the venous phase.
MRI with contrast—There is rapid, intense contrast
enhancement similar to the pattern with multiphasic CT.
Typically, focal nodular hyperplasias are isointense on
T1-weighted images and either isointense or slightly hyperintense on T2-weighted images. The central scar is usually
hypointense on T1- but hyperintense on T2-weighted images.
Gadobenate dimeglumine or gadoxetate disodium contrast
are taken up by hepatocytes and partially excreted into the
immature bile ductules of the tumor (Fig. 24.5).
Technetium 99m sulfur colloid scintigraphy—In contrast
to the hypointensity of adenomas, 50% to 60% of focal nodular hyperplasias show hyperintense or isointense uptake
because of the presence of Kupffer cells.
Biopsy

It can be difﬁcult to distinguish between focal nodular hyperplasia and adenoma because ﬁne-needle aspirates from both
lesions may show only benign-appearing hepatocytes.
Management

Asymptomatic focal nodular hyperplasias can be monitored
over time, and surgery rarely is indicated. Some groups recommend discontinuation of oral contraceptives, although this
has not been shown to result in regression of the tumor.
Simple Liver Cysts

Solitary or multiple liver cysts are common, usually asymptomatic, and often coexist with other mass lesions in the liver.
The female-to-male ratio is 4:1. Liver cysts occur in 3.6% of
the population, and the prevalence increases with age.
Histologic Features

Cysts are thin-walled structures lined by cuboidal bile duct
epithelium and ﬁlled with isotonic ﬂuid.

Clinical Features
Clinical Features

Most patients with focal nodular hyperplasia are asymptomatic. Patients with large lesions may present with abdominal
discomfort or an abdominal mass.

Cysts are usually asymptomatic unless large, when they can
cause symptoms through pressure on adjacent structures.
Rarely, large cysts may cause biliary obstruction.

Imaging Characteristics
Imaging Characteristics

Ultrasonography—Focal nodular hyperplasias have a variable
sonographic appearance, with lesions being hypoechoic, hyperechoic, or isoechoic. Most commonly, the tumors are hypoechoic except for the central scar. A color ﬂow Doppler study
may show increased blood ﬂow in the central stellate scar.
Multiphasic CT—The presence of an avascular central scar
or a feeding artery to the mass is highly suggestive of focal
nodular hyperplasia. The lesion shows rapid and intense

Ultrasonography—This is the best imaging modality for cysts.
Classically, cysts are anechoic and have smooth, round margins; a distinct far wall; and posterior acoustic enhancement
(Fig. 24.6). Ultrasonography clearly shows the wall thickness
and internal septations, if present. Thick-walled cysts with
nodularity or irregular septations suggest the diagnosis of cystadenoma or, rarely, cystadenocarcinoma.

Biopsy

Biopsy usually is not necessary because of the distinctive imaging characteristics of simple cysts.
Management

C

Large symptomatic cysts can be treated with surgical fenestration or percutaneous aspiration and instillation of ethanol to
ablate the cyst.
Focal Fat or Fat Sparing

Fatty inﬁltration of the liver is common. Focal fatty inﬁltration can give the appearance of a mass lesion on imaging studies; conversely, focal sparing in a liver with diffuse fatty
inﬁltration also can have the appearance of a mass. Fatty inﬁltration typically occurs in obese persons and in patients with
diabetes mellitus, high alcohol consumption, or altered nutritional status because of chemotherapy regimens.
Histologic Features

C, Delayed phase after intravenous injection of gadobenate
dimeglumine showing that the contrast concentrates within the tumor.

Areas of fatty inﬁltration show fat-laden cells.
Clinical Features

Focal fat or fat sparing is asymptomatic and usually discovered
on abdominal imaging performed for other causes.
CT—Cysts have the same density as water and do not
change with contrast imaging.
MRI—Cysts are hyperintense on T2-weighted images.
Small cysts may be difﬁcult to differentiate from a cavernous
hemangioma.

Imaging Characteristics

Focal fat does not distort the contour of the liver. If normal
vessels, especially veins, can be seen coursing through the

288

Section VI Liver

region, the diagnosis of focal fat is likely. Also, focal fat typically
occurs in vascular watersheds, particularly along the falciform
ligament. Skip areas of normal liver in diffuse fatty inﬁltration
typically occur adjacent to the gallbladder fossa, in subcapsular
areas, or in the posterior aspect of segment 4 of the liver.
Ultrasonography—Areas of fatty inﬁltration are hyperechoic.
CT—Fat is hypodense compared with the spleen, but
because the fat is dispersed in normal tissue, it is not as low in
density as adipose tissue. Venous structures coursing through
the areas of focal fat are seen on venous phase studies.
MRI—Fat is occasionally hyperintense on T1- and
T2-weighted images. Decreased signal intensity on out-ofphase gradient imaging is diagnostic of focal fat.
Biopsy

Biopsy studies can be used to exclude other lesions if the diagnosis cannot be established conﬁdently.
Management

None is needed. Areas of focal fat may resolve if patients lose
weight or achieve better control of diabetes.

Malignant Liver Masses
Hepatocellular Carcinoma

The major risk factors for hepatocellular carcinoma include
cirrhosis from chronic HBV or HCV infection, alcohol use,
hereditary hemochromatosis, other causes of liver injury such
as α1-antitrypsin deﬁciency, autoimmune hepatitis, primary
biliary cirrhosis, and tyrosinemia. Fungal aﬂatoxins that contaminate grains and legumes also have a synergistic effect with
other causes of liver injury and contribute to the development
of liver cancer in parts of sub-Saharan Africa and Asia.
Approximately 80% to 90% of hepatocellular carcinomas arise
in the context of cirrhosis. The other 10% to 20% comprise
two groups. The ﬁrst group includes chronic HBV-infected
patients who develop hepatocellular carcinoma in the absence
of cirrhosis, presumably due to the oncogenic effects of HBV
proteins and HBV integration, inherited familial tendency,
and, in certain areas of the world, the synergistic effect of
exposure to dietary aﬂatoxin. These patients are often young,
between 20 and 50 years old. The second group of noncirrhotic patients is characterized by older persons living in
countries with a low incidence of HBV infection who present
with sporadic onset hepatocellular carcinoma in the absence
of discernible risk factors. Without surveillance, most hepatocellular carcinomas are diagnosed at an advanced stage, when
radical treatment for cure is no longer feasible. Therefore, it is
important that persons who are at risk for hepatocellular carcinoma be enrolled in a surveillance program for early detection of the tumor.

Surveillance and Diagnosis With Imaging or Biopsy

The best outcomes for treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma
are achieved with liver transplantation, surgical resection, or
local ablative therapies such as radiofrequency ablation or
percutaneous ethanol injection. Because these therapies are
most effective when applied to early-stage hepatocellular carcinoma, there is strong rationale for emphasizing a regular
surveillance program to screen for the tumor in at-risk
persons. Current guidelines recommend that persons with cirrhosis have liver ultrasonography every 6 months to screen for
hepatocellular carcinoma. For those who have chronic hepatitis B without cirrhosis, screening should begin at age 20 years
for Africans, 40 years for Asian men, 50 years for Asian women,
or in individuals with a family history of hepatocellular carcinoma, high HBV DNA, and persistent or intermittent increase
in the level of alanine aminotransferase. The serum level of
alpha fetoprotein has low sensitivity for the detection of earlystage hepatocellular carcinoma, and its use is not recommended by current guidelines, except when high-quality
ultrasonography is not available. However, a high body mass
index and central obesity of many US patients frequently
render full ultrasonographic visualization of the liver difﬁcult;
hence, alpha fetoprotein measurement remains part of the de
facto standard for surveillance of hepatocellular carcinoma.
Once a new mass is identiﬁed with ultrasonography, it
should be conﬁrmed with cross-sectional imaging with multiphasic contrast-enhanced CT or MRI. The combination of
arterial enhancement with washout in the portal venous phase
is the hallmark of early-stage hepatocellular carcinoma and is
highly speciﬁc (Fig. 24.7). Hepatocellular carcinoma can be
diagnosed noninvasively if a new nodule (>1 cm) found during
surveillance to arise in a cirrhotic liver shows typical arterial
enhancement and venous washout on triphasic CT or MRI.
The major rationale for noninvasive diagnosis in early-stage
hepatocellular carcinoma is to prevent tumor seeding and
recurrence after potentially curative treatment, including liver
transplant. Patients who present with newly discovered liver
masses in the absence of cirrhosis should have a biopsy study
to histologically conﬁrm hepatocellular carcinoma because
conditions such as lymphomas and metastases from other primary sites not infrequently masquerade as hepatocellular carcinoma in a noncirrhotic liver. Determination of the alpha
fetoprotein level may obviate the need for biopsy if the level is
markedly increased, but it is important to consider that malignancies at other primary sites, notably esophageal and gastric
carcinomas, also can be associated with a high level of alpha
fetoprotein.
Management
Liver Transplantation

Liver resection and transplantation offer the greatest chance of
cure for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. The selection
of resection versus transplantation is based on a careful evaluation of the comorbid conditions of the patient, liver function,

cirrhosis who have well-preserved liver function and little or
no portal hypertension. For patients without cirrhosis, major
liver resection can be performed with low mortality rates
(<5%), with a 5-year survival rate of 30% to 50%. The major
causes of perioperative mortality in patients with cirrhosis
who have liver resection are bleeding and liver failure. Limited
liver resections are safe in patients with cirrhosis who have
preserved liver function (Child-Pugh class A) and no portal
hypertension. Multiple methods of assessing liver function,
liver reserve, and perioperative mortality have been described
and are important in selecting patients for resection. The
model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) has been shown to
predict perioperative mortality after liver resection. Patients
with a MELD score less than 9 have a perioperative mortality
rate of 0%, compared with 29% for those with a score of 9 or
more. After liver resection, the tumor recurs in approximately
70% of patients within 5 years and reﬂects both intrahepatic
metastases and the development of de novo tumors in the diseased liver. Predictors of recurrence and survival after resection include tumor size and number and vascular invasion.
The 5-year survival rate after liver resection is 30% to 50%.
For ideal candidates (single tumor, preserved liver function,
absence of portal hypertension), the 5-year survival rate is as
high as 50% to 70%.
Local and Locoregional Therapies

washout (arrow).

tumor size, number of tumors, vascular invasion, candidacy
for transplantation, and organ availability. Transplantation is
an effective treatment option for hepatocellular carcinoma of
patients with cirrhosis because it addresses both the neoplasm
and underlying liver disease. Initially, the outcomes of transplantation for hepatocellular carcinoma were poor. However,
with advances in patient selection using the Milan criteria
(one tumor up to 5 cm large or two or three tumors, with the
largest no more than 3 cm, without vascular invasion or extrahepatic spread), the 5-year survival rate is 70% to 80% and
the recurrence rate is less than 15%. Despite the favorable
results of transplantation, organ availability is less than the
demand and up to 15% of patients listed for transplant will
drop out because of tumor progression before an organ
becomes available.
Surgery

Liver resection is the preferred treatment for hepatocellular
carcinoma in patients without cirrhosis and in those with

Local modalities for treating hepatocellular carcinoma include
ablative methods such as percutaneous ethanol injection and
radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and locoregional therapies such
as transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), transarterial radioembolization (TARE), and conformal beam radiotherapy.
Percutaneous ethanol injection is performed under ultrasonographic guidance and is used for treatment of small hepatocellular carcinomas up to 3 cm large in patients who are not
candidates for liver transplantation or when liver transplantation is not available. Ethanol induces tumor necrosis and is
particularly effective in the cirrhotic liver because the surrounding ﬁbrotic tissue limits the diffusion of the injected
ethanol. Two or three injection sessions usually are needed for
complete ablation of the tumor. The low cost of this treatment
makes it attractive for use in lower income countries.
RFA is the more efﬁcacious ablative treatment modality
and is used more often than percutaneous ethanol injection in
clinical practice. It has the same efﬁcacy as surgical resection
in treating single, small (<2 cm) hepatocellular carcinomas.
With RFA, a high-frequency electrical current is applied to a
treatment probe that is inserted into the tumor. RFA typically
produces complete necrosis of a 3- to 4-cm radius of tissue
during a single 10- to 15-minute treatment. RFA can be
applied to overlapping ﬁelds to treat lesions larger than 3 cm,
but it is not as effective for these lesions. RFA is not effective
for the treatment of tumors close to major blood vessels because
of rapid conduction of heat away from the tumor due to a
heat-sink effect. Also, RFA can damage the biliary tree if applied
too close to major bile ducts. Several early studies raised concerns about increased risks of tumor seeding after RFA.

290

Section VI Liver

Advances in the ablation technique have lowered this risk substantially. Most often, surface lesions are approached through
the liver parenchyma rather than through direct puncture of
the liver surface. In addition, the probe track is cauterized
as the probe is being removed; this destroys and prevents
dissemination of any residual hepatocellular carcinoma cells.
TACE involves the angiographic injection of a combination of chemotherapy agents with gelfoam particles into the
branch of the hepatic artery that supplies the tumor. The goal
is to deliver high concentrations of antitumor agents and,
simultaneously, to induce tumor necrosis by occluding the
arterial supply to the tumor. The chemotherapy agents typically used for TACE include cisplatin, doxorubicin, and mitomycin C. Some centers use chemotherapy agents dissolved in
iodized oil (lipiodol); however, this iodinated contrast agent
can interfere with subsequent detection of arterial enhancement in residual tumor nodules. TACE is particularly effective
in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma because almost
all the blood supply to the tumor is from branches of the
hepatic artery. In contrast, the benign liver has a dual blood
supply, with 70% to 80% of the blood supply provided by the
portal vein and 20% to 30% by the hepatic artery. Consequently,
occlusion of the branches of the hepatic artery to the tumor
can be achieved without substantially compromising the blood
supply to the surrounding cirrhotic liver. The major contraindication to TACE is complete obstruction of the portal vein, in
which case concomitant obstruction of the arterial supply can
lead to hepatic ischemia and induce liver decompensation.
Randomized controlled trials have shown that TACE improves
survival of patients with unresectable intermediate-stage
hepatocellular carcinoma. TACE is an alternative treatment
option for patients with early-stage hepatocellular carcinoma
when ablative treatment cannot be performed safely because
of the location of the tumor. TACE also is used frequently for
downsizing the tumor or as a bridging treatment before liver
transplantation. More recent studies have showed that TACE
with doxorubicin drug-eluting beads is superior to conventional TACE and has fewer adverse effects and better survival
rates.
TARE delivers intratumoral radiation by transarterial
injection of yttrium-90 radioactive microspheres, following
the principles of TACE. Increasingly, it has been used to treat
unresectable multifocal hepatocellular carcinoma, including
hepatocellular carcinoma with portal vein invasion. Although
TARE has not been studied as rigorously as TACE, it appears
to have a clinical outcome equivalent to that of TACE, with
acceptable safety and improved tolerability.
Systemic or Targeted Therapy

For patients with advanced multifocal disease in the liver or at
extrahepatic sites, no safe and effective therapy was available
until recently. In early 2007, a large multicenter study showed
that the multitargeting kinase inhibitor sorafenib had signiﬁcant efﬁcacy in a population of mostly Child-Pugh class
A patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma, doubling the median time to radiographic progression from

12.3 to 24.0 weeks and increasing overall survival from 34.4
to 46.3 weeks. Sorafenib was approved by the US Food and
Drug Administration in late 2007 for treatment of unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma, and, currently, it is considered
the standard treatment for advanced-stage hepatocellular carcinoma. Currently, the use of sorafenib either after curative
resection or RFA (STORM study) or in combination with
TACE (SPACE study) is being investigated.
Cholangiocarcinoma

Cholangiocarcinomas are malignancies that arise from the
bile duct epithelium. In Western countries, primary sclerosing
cholangitis is the primary identiﬁed risk factor for cholangiocarcinoma. In several countries in Asia, liver ﬂuke infestations
of the biliary tract are an important risk factor. Choledochal
and other cystic disorders of the biliary tract also are associated with cholangiocarcinoma. Patients with chronic HCV
infection with cirrhosis are also at increased risk for cholangiocarcinoma. However, most patients with cholangiocarcinoma have no known risk factors. For patients with
primary sclerosing cholangitis, the risk of diagnosis of
cholangiocarcinoma is highest within the ﬁrst 2 years after
the diagnosis of primary sclerosing cholangitis, suggesting
perhaps that the development of cancer is the event that in
some way triggers the diagnosis of primary sclerosing cholangitis. Cholangiocarcinomas are classiﬁed as intrahepatic and
extrahepatic tumors. The presentation of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas is typically as a large intrahepatic mass with
or without intrahepatic or regional lymph node metastases.
Extrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas may be perihilar tumors,
which arise in the distal right or left hepatic ducts or at
the bifurcation of the common hepatic duct, or distal bile
duct tumors arising in the common bile duct. The laboratory
test most often used to conﬁrm the diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma is CA19-9. A CA19-9 value more than 100 ng/mL
is about 65% to 75% sensitive and 85% to 95% speciﬁc for
the diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma. CA19-9 also can be
increased in pancreatic adenocarcinomas and other upper
gastrointestinal tract malignancies. CA19-9 values greater
than 1,000 ng/mL usually are predictive of extrahepatic metastatic disease.
Histologic Features

Histologically, cholangiocarcinomas are adenocarcinomas.
This frequently leads to confusion about the primary site of
the tumor. Thus, cholangiocarcinoma can be misdiagnosed as
metastatic adenocarcinoma of unknown primary site.
Clinical Features

The clinical features of cholangiocarcinoma depend on its
location. Approximately 60% to 70% of these tumors are at
the bifurcation of the hepatic duct; the rest occur in the extrahepatic (20%–30%) or intrahepatic (5%–15%) biliary tree.

24 Clinical Approach to Liver Mass Lesions

The most common symptom of extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma is painless jaundice due to obstruction of biliary ducts.
With tumors of the intrahepatic bile ducts, patients often have
pain without jaundice. With perihilar or intrahepatic tumors,
jaundice often occurs later in the disease course and is a marker
of advanced disease. Other common symptoms include generalized itching, abdominal pain, weight loss, and fever. Pruritis
usually is preceded by jaundice, but it may be the initial presenting symptom of cholangiocarcinoma. The pain associated
with cholangiocarcinoma is usually a constant dull ache in the
right upper quadrant of the abdomen. Biliary obstruction
results in clay-colored stools and dark urine. Physical signs
include jaundice, hepatomegaly, and a palpable right upper
quadrant mass. Patients with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma most often present with dull right upper quadrant discomfort and weight loss.
Imaging Characteristics

Abdominal ultrasonography—Cholangiocarcinomas are typically hypoechoic on ultrasonography and sometimes are ﬁrst
visualized during an ultrasonographic examination of the liver
for suspected gallstone disease causing right upper quadrant
abdominal discomfort.
Multiphasic CT—Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas are
usually hypodense on noncontrast imaging, often with a
rounded, smooth, nodular appearance. During the arterial
phase, there is minimal enhancement that progressively
increases through the venous phase, often more prominent
peripherally than centrally. Perihilar cholangiocarcinomas
that preferentially affect one lobe of the liver often lead to unilobar biliary obstruction for an extended period, during which
time the patient has a normal bilirubin level because of adequate biliary drainage from the unaffected lobe of the liver.
Eventually, the affected lobe undergoes atrophy, with prominent biliary dilatation, while the unaffected lobe undergoes
compensatory hypertrophy. This syndrome is called the atrophy-hypertrophy complex (Fig. 24.8). Cross-sectional imaging
is particularly helpful for assessing the degree of encasement
of the hilar vasculature, a critically important part of the evaluation for surgical resectability.
MRI with gadolinium or ferumoxides—Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas are hypointense on T1- and hyperintense
on T2-weighted images. There is peripheral contrast enhancement that progresses into the venous phase, similar to the pattern seen with multiphasic CT. Imaging with ferumoxides can
enhance visualization of small peribiliary cholangiocarcinomas. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP)
is performed concomitantly with MRI and is now recommended as the optimal initial investigation for assessing the
luminal extent and resectability of suspected cholangiocarcinoma. MRCP is noninvasive and as accurate as direct cholangiography in assessing the level of biliary tract obstruction.
Often, the biliary tract peripheral to a biliary stenosis can be
demonstrated better with MRCP than with endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP).

291

Figure 24.8 Cholangiocarcinoma with atrophy-hypertrophy

complex. Note cholangiocarcinoma with obstruction of the left
biliary ductal system (arrow) and consequent marked dilatation of
the bile ducts in the left lobe, with associated atrophy of the left lobe
parenchyma. The right lobe shows compensatory hypertrophy.

Cholangiography—With the advent of MRI and MRCP,
direct cholangiography via ERCP and percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (PTC) are becoming less important as
initial diagnostic modalities; however, the resolution provided
by PTC and ERCP is still better in some cases than that of
MRCP. In addition to providing tissue samples by brush cytology or biopsy, PTC and ERCP allow placement of therapeutic
stents for biliary decompression if needed and also can be used
to deliver photodynamic therapy to unresectable tumors. In
patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis, PTC can be challenging technically because of peripheral strictures; for these
patients, ERCP is the preferred modality. A completely
occluded distal biliary tract may preclude the use of ERCP,
and either PTC or a combined approach of PTC and ERCP
may be needed for successful passage through a difﬁcult stricture to accomplish internal biliary drainage, which is preferred
to external drainage.
Biopsy and Cytology

Intrahepatic mass-forming cholangiocarcinomas usually are
biopsied under ultrasonographic or CT guidance. Often,
ductal cholangiocarcinomas are less amenable to percutaneous needle biopsy. Also, autoimmune pancreatitis with biliary
involvement can mimic a malignant biliary stricture, rendering the accurate diagnosis of biliary strictures even more difﬁcult. Pinch forceps biopsy samples and cytologic brushings
usually are obtained at ERCP or PTC to help establish the
diagnosis. Because many cholangiocarcinomas are highly desmoplastic, with a prominent ﬁbrous stromal component separating small islands of malignant epithelium, histologic and
cytologic conﬁrmation of their malignancy can be challenging. Recently, advanced cytologic tests for chromosomal polysomy such as ﬂuorescence in situ hybridization have been

Hilar cholangiocarcinoma accounts for two-thirds of all cases
of extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma is treated with surgical resection when feasible.
Tumors in the mid-bile duct can be treated with resection and
anastomosis of the bile duct. Distal extrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas are treated with pancreaticoduodenectomy. For hilar
cholangiocarcinomas, surgical planning is more complex and
preoperative evaluation of the local and regional extent of the
tumor is critical. Cross-sectional imaging and cholangiography (either direct or MRCP) are necessary for appropriate
patient selection and surgical planning. Current criteria that
preclude resection include 1) bilateral ductal extension to secondary radicles; 2) encasement or occlusion of the main portal
vein; 3) lobar atrophy with involvement of the contralateral
portal vein, hepatic artery, or secondary biliary radicles; 4)
peripancreatic (head only), periduodenal, posterior pancreatoduodenal, periportal, celiac, or superior mesenteric regional
lymph node metastases; and 5) distant metastases. The perioperative mortality rate of hepatic resection for hilar cholangiocarcinoma is between 5% and 10% in major centers. The
operation of choice for hilar cholangiocarcinoma is cholecystectomy, lobar or extended lobar hepatic and bile duct
resection, regional lymphadenectomy, and Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy. With surgical resection, the 5-year survival
rate is 20% to 25%.

Cytology samples with cells that show polysomy of two or
more relevant chromosomal loci, typically chromosomes 3, 7,
or 17 in the current iteration of the Vysis UroVysion ﬂuorescence in situ probe set that is used, are highly speciﬁc for
cancer (Fig. 24.9).
Endoscopic ultrasonography—Endoscopic ultrasonography with an ultrasound probe at the tip of a duodenoscope
allows high-resolution evaluation of the left lobe of the liver
and ﬁne-needle aspiration of lymph nodes at the hepatic
hilum. This technique has proven extremely useful for assessing the presence and malignancy of regional lymph nodes
during staging of cholangiocarcinomas.

A protocol of neoadjuvant chemoradiation followed by liver
transplant for patients with hilar cholangiocarcinoma or cholangiocarcinoma arising in association with primary sclerosing cholangitis has been developed at Mayo Clinic (Rochester,
Minnesota). The protocol is limited to patients who have a
mass smaller than 3 cm and excludes patients who have intrahepatic peripheral cholangiocarcinoma, metastases, or gallbladder involvement. Endoscopic ultrasonography is
performed with directed aspiration to rule out involvement of
regional hepatic lymph nodes. Patients are treated initially
with preoperative radiotherapy (40.5–45 Gy, given as 1.5
Gy twice daily) and 5-ﬂuorouracil. This is followed by 20- to
30-Gy transcatheter irradiation with iridium. Capecitabine is
then administered until transplantation. Before transplantation, patients undergo a staging abdominal exploration.
Regional lymph node metastases, peritoneal metastases, or
locally extensive disease preclude transplantation. At the time
of the last published review of patients treated since 1993,
71 patients had begun neoadjuvant therapy at Mayo Clinic
and 38 (54%) had had favorable ﬁndings at the staging operation and subsequent liver transplantation. The 5-year actuarial
survival for all patients that begin neoadjuvant therapy is 58%;
the 5-year survival rate for those undergoing transplantation
is 82%. These results exceed those achieved with surgical
resection even though all the transplant protocol patients have
unresectable cholangiocarcinoma or cholangiocarcinoma

combination with systemic chemotherapy appropriate for the
primary tumor.

Summary
Systemic Chemotherapy

Various chemotherapy agents have been evaluated for the
treatment of cholangiocarcinoma, but generally there is only a
limited response to these agents. The current standard of care
is gemcitabine, which can be given alone or in combination
with either capecitabine or oxaliplatin. These regimens produce responses in 25% to 64% of patients, with a median survival rate of 10 to 15 months. It is not clear whether multiagent
therapy has any beneﬁt over gemcitabine alone.

A wide range of liver mass lesions initially may or may not
produce symptoms. Many masses are found incidentally
during imaging for nonspeciﬁc abdominal symptoms.
Accurate differentiation of benign from malignant lesions
depends on obtaining a complete history, physical examination, and appropriate laboratory tests. Most benign lesions
require no intervention, but an important subset requires
multidisciplinary evaluation, followed by surgical resection or
other treatments.

Maintenance of Biliary Patency

For patients with unresectable tumor causing biliary obstruction, the maintenance of biliary patency is required for substantial survival. This usually is achieved with the use of plastic
endobiliary stents, which generally remain patent for 8 to
12 weeks, or metal stents, which may remain patent for more
than a year. Unilateral drainage is generally sufﬁcient for palliation of biliary obstruction and is associated with fewer complications than bilateral stenting. Photodynamic therapy,
administered by intravenous infusion of the photosensitizer
porﬁmer sodium (Photofrin) that preferentially accumulates
in the proliferating tumor tissue, followed 48 hours later with
endoscopic or percutaneous application of a laser light tuned
to the appropriate wavelength, is applied endoscopically
through a glass ﬁber inserted to the site of the malignant
biliary stricture.
Liver Metastases

Liver metastases from other primary cancer sites are the most
frequent malignant liver masses. Metastases most commonly
are from colorectal adenocarcinomas but are also frequent in
patients with pancreatic, esophageal, gastric, neuroendocrine,
or breast cancer. Other potential primary tumors include
lung cancers, lymphomas, thyroid cancers, and renal cell
carcinomas. Most often, liver metastases are multiple and
distributed throughout both lobes of the liver. They tend
not to have a large dominant lesion with multiple smaller
satellite lesions, a feature that is more characteristic of
primary liver tumors such as hepatocellular carcinoma
and cholangiocarcinoma. Liver metastases have various
imaging characteristics, depending on the degree of vascularity. Most commonly, they show persistent enhancement in the
portal venous and venous phases of multiphasic crosssectional CT or MRI studies. Some metastases also have a
characteristic “halo” of nonenhancing tissue around the
nodule. Limited disease with only a few metastatic nodules
can be treated with surgical resection or conformal radiotherapy. For metastases that are more diffuse within the
liver, locoregional therapy with TARE can be administered in

Alcoholic Liver Disease
Vijay H. Shah, MD

Epidemiology and Clinical Spectruma

Risk Factors

Public Health Signiﬁcance

Alcohol Ingestion

Alcoholic liver disease is a major cause of morbidity and
mortality in the United States. Alcohol is implicated in more
than 50% of liver-related deaths in the United States, and
complications of alcoholism contribute to a quarter of a million deaths annually. Also, alcoholic liver disease is a major
health care cost expenditure, accounting for nearly $3 billion
annually.
Clinical Spectrum

The clinical spectrum of alcoholic liver disease includes fatty
liver, alcoholic hepatitis, and alcoholic cirrhosis. Fatty liver
develops in response to short periods (days) of alcohol abuse.
It is generally asymptomatic and reversible with abstinence.
More advanced liver injury usually requires prolonged alcohol
abuse over a period of years. Of note, the majority of people
who abuse alcohol for extended periods do not develop more
advanced lesions of alcoholic liver disease. However, alcoholic
hepatitis or alcoholic cirrhosis (or both) develops in about
20% of these people.

virus; INR, international normalized ratio; MELD, model for endstage liver disease; MEOS, microsomal ethanol oxidizing system;
NAD, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, oxidized; NADH, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, reduced

Although alcoholic fatty liver may develop in response to short
periods of alcohol abuse, even only a few days, more advanced
and morbid liver injury requires prolonged alcohol abuse. In
most cases, the level of ethanol consumption required for
the development of advanced forms of alcoholic liver
disease is 60 to 80 g of alcohol daily for men, or the approximate equivalent of 6 to 8 drinks per day for several years.
In women, half of this amount may cause clinically signiﬁcant
alcoholic liver disease. The quantity of alcohol necessary
for liver injury probably does not depend on the type of alcohol consumed. However, there is considerable individual variability in the threshold of alcohol necessary for advanced
alcoholic liver disease to develop, and clearly factors other
than absolute ethanol consumption are important in determining which persons develop alcoholic liver disease. A
recently identiﬁed risk factor is obesity. Other risk factors are
described below.
Genetic and Hereditary Factors

The interindividual variability in the correlation between alcohol consumption and development of liver disease emphasizes
the role of genetic factors that may predispose a person to
alcohol-induced liver toxicity. Speciﬁc genetic polymorphisms
have been detected in patients who have alcoholic liver disease, notably mutations in the tumor necrosis factor promoter
and in alcohol-metabolizing enzyme systems. In addition to
the genetic factors predisposing certain alcoholic persons to
liver disease, there also is strong evidence that genetic factors
predispose persons to alcoholism. Currently, however, no
single genetic polymorphism has been shown deﬁnitively to
contribute to alcoholic liver disease.

295

296

Section VI Liver

Sex

Although alcoholic liver disease is observed more commonly
in men than in women, women are predisposed to the development of this disease and develop more severe disease with
less alcohol consumption than men. The reason for this greater
risk in women is not clear; however, despite weight adjustment, a similar level of alcohol consumption results in higher
blood alcohol levels in women than in men. Theories to
explain this include a relative deﬁciency of gastric alcohol
dehydrogenase in women, sex differences in alcohol bioavailability, and female hormone-related effects.
• Alcoholic liver disease encompasses a clinicohistologic
spectrum (fatty liver, hepatitis, and cirrhosis).
• Although there is considerable variability among persons, the toxic dose of alcohol necessary for advanced
liver injury to develop is probably 60 to 80 g daily for
several years, with a signiﬁcantly lower threshold for
women.
• Genetic factors contribute to alcoholic liver disease by
predisposing a person to alcoholism as well as to alcoholinduced liver injury.
• Although fatty liver occurs nearly uniformly with excess
alcohol consumption, more advanced liver injury occurs
in only 15% to 20% of persons who continue to abuse
alcohol.
• Alcoholic hepatitis may occur in the presence or absence
of preexisting liver cirrhosis.

Ethanol Metabolism and Pathophysiology

More than one enzyme system is capable of metabolizing
alcohol in the liver. Enzymes that have received the greatest
attention include alcohol dehydrogenase, aldehyde dehydrogenase, and the microsomal ethanol-oxidizing system (MEOS)
(Fig. 25.1). When physiologic circumstances are normal and
blood levels of alcohol are low, the enzyme of major importance is alcohol dehydrogenase. This enzyme catalyzes the
conversion of alcohol to acetaldehyde, and aldehyde dehydrogenase subsequently catalyzes the conversion of acetaldehyde
to acetate. Alcohol dehydrogenase catalysis changes the
oxidation-reduction state in the cell by increasing the ratio of

reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) to the
oxidized form (NAD), which has important implications for
other cellular processes, including the generation of free radicals, inhibition of other enzyme systems, and accumulation of
fat. Also, an isoform of alcohol dehydrogenase occurs within
the gastric mucosa, although the clinical importance of the
gastric component of alcohol metabolism is debated.
MEOS is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum instead of
the cytosol, where the alcohol dehydrogenase system operates,
and appears to be important in alcohol metabolism when
blood levels of alcohol are moderate to high. Under normal
conditions when these levels are low, the role of MEOS is
much smaller than that of the alcohol dehydrogenase system.
As explained by its enzyme kinetics, MEOS has a greater role
in cases of chronic alcohol use because it is induced by alcohol,
thereby allowing progressively increased ethanol metabolism
in alcoholics. MEOS also converts alcohol to acetaldehyde,
requiring aldehyde dehydrogenase for further metabolism.
Importantly, the speciﬁc MEOS enzyme CYP2E1 is responsible for the metabolism of various other compounds. The
induction of CYP2E1 by alcohol importantly affects blood
levels of these compounds and accounts for the increased tolerance of alcoholics to sedatives. Compounds that are metabolized rapidly in alcoholics by this process include isoniazid
and acetaminophen. Importantly, nearly one-half of the population of eastern and southeastern Asia are deﬁcient in aldehyde dehydrogenase activity because of the inheritance of a
mutant allele. This can result in excess accumulation of aldehyde, accounting for alcohol-induced ﬂushing symptoms in
these persons. A similar ﬂushing syndrome is observed in
response to alcohol consumption when a person ingests disulfuram, which is the basis for its use in the treatment of alcoholism. Although the peroxisomal catalase enzyme also is
capable of ethanol metabolism, its physiologic role in alcohol
metabolism appears to be minor.
Experimental evidence suggests that the alcohol metabolite
acetaldehyde may be a toxic mediator of alcohol-induced liver
injury. The mechanism by which alcohol and acetaldehyde
cause liver injury is being investigated. The initiation of
fat accumulation within the liver appears to occur in response
to the decreased oxidation and increased accumulation of
fatty acids. These events may be linked to changes in the liver
oxidation-reduction state induced by ethanol metabolism.

major role in metabolism. Acetaldehyde derived from both these pathways is metabolized by aldehyde dehydrogenase to acetate. MEOS

Other important physiologic events that mediate liver injury
include increased oxidative stress, hepatocyte apoptosis and
necrosis, and deposition of collagen, with ensuing ﬁbrosis
through activation of liver stellate cells. Various cytokines,
transcription factors, and intracellular signaling pathways
have been implicated in these events.

bilirubin (or both) may be observed. Prothrombin time is
normal. As in the above case, laboratory abnormalities often
are noted incidentally in an asymptomatic person.

• Alcohol dehydrogenase is the primary alcohol-metabolizing pathway, particularly when blood alcohol levels
are low.
• MEOS is important in alcoholics, especially when
blood levels of alcohol are high. Induction of this
system importantly affects the metabolism of various
xenobiotics.
• Diminished activity of aldehyde dehydrogenase accounts
for the ﬂushing syndrome detected in a large proportion
of Asians who consume alcohol.

Generally, liver biopsy is not necessary to establish the diagnosis of alcoholic fatty liver because the condition is benign and
reversible. However, biopsy may be performed to determine
whether the patient has more advanced alcoholic liver disease
or another condition. The principal feature of alcoholic fatty
liver in biopsy specimens is macrovesicular steatosis within
hepatocytes (Fig. 25.2). There are no inﬂammatory cells or
collagen deposition. Because biopsy specimens from patients
with Wilson’s disease occasionally have the features of steatosis, Wilson’s disease should always be excluded in young persons who have abnormal levels of liver enzymes.

Fatty Liver
Clinical Presentation

A 22-year-old male college student has a series of laboratory
tests performed during a routine checkup at the student health
clinic. He is asymptomatic, and the physical examination ﬁndings are normal. He takes no medications and has no family
history of liver disease. He is not sexually active and says he
does not use intravenous or intranasal drugs, has not traveled
recently, and has not had blood transfusions. Laboratory ﬁndings include the following: aspartate aminotransferase (AST)
65 U/L (normal 8-48 U/L), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 43
U/L (normal 7-55 U/L), γ-glutamyltransferase (GGT) 336 U/L
(normal 9-31 U/L); mean corpuscular volume and total bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase levels are normal. On further
questioning, the patient admits to having had 6 to 10 drinks
per day over the past week during student orientation.
This patient has the clinical features suggestive of alcoholic
fatty liver. The diagnosis and treatment are discussed below.

Histologic Features

Prognosis and Treatment

No speciﬁc treatment other than abstinence is required for
management of alcoholic fatty liver. If abstinence is achieved,
alcoholic fatty liver is entirely reversible. However, 20% to
30% of patients who continue to abuse alcohol chronically
develop more advanced forms of alcoholic liver disease,
including alcoholic hepatitis and cirrhosis.
• Alcoholic fatty liver may develop in response to short
periods of alcohol abuse, although it is more common
with chronic alcohol abuse.
• Treatment is focused on abstinence or more judicious
consumption of alcohol.

Alcoholic Hepatitis
Clinical Presentation

Fatty liver may develop in response to only a transient alcohol
insult, over a period of days. The most salient historical feature is an alcohol binge. The patient may be asymptomatic or
may complain of mild nonspeciﬁc symptoms, including
fatigue, malaise, abdominal discomfort, and anorexia. On
physical examination, tender hepatomegaly may be prominent. Stigmata of chronic liver disease are absent, and in many
patients, the physical examination ﬁndings are normal.

A 36-year-old man complains of fatigue, dark urine, and
abdominal swelling. He admits to drinking a few beers a day
since his teen years, but he has never had a major medical
problem. Recently, he has been drinking more heavily while
unemployed. He states that he has not had blood transfusions
and does not use intravenous drugs. Physical examination
ﬁndings are remarkable for tachycardia and low-grade fever.
Prominent scleral icterus is noted, and the abdominal examination shows shifting dullness. The liver span is increased on
percussion.
This patient has the clinical features typical of alcoholic
hepatitis. The diagnosis and treatment are discussed below.

Laboratory and Radiographic Features

History and Physical Examination

the serum levels of aminotransferases, predominantly an
increase in AST. Minor increases in alkaline phosphatase or

advanced lesions, such as alcoholic hepatitis. Persons who
drink more than 60 to 80 g of alcohol daily for a period of
years are at risk for the development of alcoholic hepatitis; the
threshold is lower for women. Also, alcoholic hepatitis may
develop in the presence or absence of underlying liver cirrhosis. The clinical presentation of alcoholic hepatitis includes
constitutional symptoms such as weakness, anorexia, and
weight loss and other nonspeciﬁc symptoms such as nausea
and vomiting. Severe alcoholic hepatitis may include more
advanced symptoms related to portal hypertension, including

gastrointestinal tract bleeding, ascites, and hepatic encephalopathy. It is important to identify risk factors for concomitant
or alternative forms of acute and chronic hepatitis, such as
viral hepatitis, Wilson’s disease, and drug-induced hepatitis.
The diagnosis of alcoholic hepatitis is contingent on determining whether the patient is abusing alcohol. This is not
always easy because alcoholic persons and even their family
members often minimize or hide their alcohol use. An independent history from multiple family members is often necessary to corroborate the patient’s alcohol history, and different

25 Alcoholic Liver Disease

caregivers may obtain a different history from the same interviewee because of the type of relation between the patient and
caregiver and the approach and persistence of different history
takers. Questionnaires have been used to clarify alcohol use
and abuse syndromes; however, because of their length, many
of them are limited to research purposes. The most useful
screening questionnaire in clinical practice is the CAGE questionnaire, which includes the following inquiries: Has the
patient felt the need to cut back on alcohol use? Has the patient
become annoyed with other persons’ concerns about his or
her alcohol use? Does the patient feel guilty about his or her
alcohol use? Does the patient use alcohol in the morning as an
eye-opener? Although two positive responses have a high sensitivity and positive predictive value for alcohol dependency,
any positive response to these inquiries requires a more
detailed investigation and should heighten the suspicion of
alcohol abuse.
In patients with alcoholic hepatitis, physical examination
ﬁndings are most notable for tender hepatomegaly, fever, and
tachycardia. Other ﬁndings depend on the severity of liver
insult, the presence or absence of concomitant cirrhosis, and
the presence or absence of portal hypertension. These ﬁndings
may include jaundice, splenomegaly, collateral vessels, hypogonadism, palmar erythema, asterixis, and ascites in patients
with severe alcoholic hepatitis and portal hypertension.
Evidence for concomitant infection is common and may be
detected on examination, including signs of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, pneumonia, or cellulitis.
Laboratory and Radiographic Features

Laboratory abnormalities reﬂect the extrahepatic adverse
effects of alcohol as well as alcohol-induced liver injury
(Table 25.1). Mean corpuscular volume usually is increased,
reﬂecting the adverse effect of alcohol on erythrocytes. The
levels of triglycerides and uric acid also are frequently increased.
Patients are prone to ketoacidosis. Peripheral polymorphonuclear leukocytosis is prominent, and in some cases, a leukemoid reaction also may be observed. Aminotransferase levels
usually are increased less than 5 to 10 times normal, but they
may be higher with concomitant acetaminophen toxicity.
Also, the level of AST almost always is higher than that of ALT,
which is opposite to that in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis,
in which the ALT level is often higher than the AST level. This
in combination with other variables determines the ALD/
NAFLD Index (ANI) (http://www.mayoclinic.org/gi-rst/mayo
model10.html), a tool that helps distinguish nonalcoholic
fatty liver disease from alcoholic hepatitis. Both the modest
increase in aminotransferase levels and the greater increase in
AST than in ALT help to differentiate alcoholic hepatitis from
alternative diagnoses. Some laboratory abnormalities reﬂect
the severity of the alcohol-induced liver injury and are
prognostically useful, including prothrombin time and
bilirubin concentration. In moderate to severe cases of alcoholic hepatitis, prothrombin time and bilirubin concentration
are increased, and, in contrast to aminotransferase levels,

299

prothrombin time and bilirubin concentration have prognostic utility. Attempts have been made to use bilirubin concentration, prothrombin time, and other laboratory variables to
assess the prognosis of patients who have alcoholic hepatitis.
The most widely used of these assessments is the Maddrey discriminant function analysis:
Discriminant function =
4.6 (prothrombin time − control)
+ serum bilirubin concentration (mg/dL)
A discriminant function greater than 32 effectively identiﬁes patients whose risk of death is higher than 50%. The model
for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score also predicts survival
for patients with alcoholic hepatitis. MELD score and corresponding 90-day survival can be calculated on the basis of the
patient’s creatinine, international normalized ratio (INR), and
bilirubin values at the following Web site: http://www.mayo
clinic.org/girst/mayomodel7.html. Other frequently observed
laboratory abnormalities that may cause diagnostic confusion
or suggest multifactorial liver disease include increases in
iron saturation indices and ferritin, hepatitis C virus (HCV)
antibody positivity, and increased levels of autoimmune markers such as antinuclear antibody and anti–smooth muscle
antibody. Rather than reﬂecting the concomitant presence
of hereditary hemochromatosis or autoimmune hepatitis,
increases in iron indices and autoimmune markers more commonly reﬂect the pathogenic role of iron deposition and
autoimmunity in the development of alcoholic hepatitis. In
cases in which the alcohol history is questionable, a Doppler
ultrasonographic study is useful to exclude alternative diagnoses such as cholecystitis, biliary obstruction, and hepatic vein
thrombosis, which may manifest in a manner similar to alcoholic hepatitis. The false diagnosis of gallstone disease can be

catastrophic because of the high surgical morbidity and mortality of patients with alcoholic hepatitis.
With the inherent difﬁculties in obtaining a reliable history
of alcohol use, several biochemical markers have been evaluated for the detection of surreptitious alcohol abuse. Many
traditional serologic tests of alcohol abuse are based on assessing alcohol abuse indirectly by examining such markers of
liver injury as AST, ALT, the ratio of AST to ALT, and GGT.
However, because these tests assess alcohol abuse indirectly by
detecting liver injury, their sensitivity and speciﬁcity generally
are less than 70%. Mean corpuscular volume also indirectly
assesses alcohol abuse by evaluating bone marrow toxicity of
alcohol; it can be helpful as an adjunctive test. Carbohydratedeﬁcient transferrin reﬂects the desialylation of transferrin
that occurs in response to high alcohol use, and mitochondrial
AST is a speciﬁc isoform of the enzyme that is released from
hepatocytes injured by alcohol. However, these tests have not
been shown universally to be more effective than the less
expensive AST-to-ALT ratio, GGT, and mean corpuscular
volume.
Histologic Features

With advances in noninvasive liver diagnostic capabilities over
the past decade, the diagnosis of alcoholic hepatitis often is
made without liver biopsy. However, liver biopsy is indicated
if the diagnosis is in question after noninvasive evaluation. In
particular, histologic examination may be useful in distinguishing coexisting or alternative liver disorders such as
hereditary hemochromatosis in persons with high iron saturation, Wilson’s disease in younger persons with low to lownormal ceruloplasmin levels, autoimmune hepatitis in persons
with high titers of autoimmune markers, and hepatitis C in
persons positive for HCV antibody. Liver biopsy, if pursued,
often requires a transjugular rather than a percutaneous route,
depending on the degree of coagulopathy and thrombocytopenia. In alcoholic hepatitis, liver biopsy specimens demonstrate several characteristic features, including centrilobular
and sometimes periportal polymorphonuclear inﬁltrates, centrilobular hepatocyte swelling, ballooning degeneration,
macrovesicular steatosis, and Mallory bodies (Fig. 25.2).
Often, pericentral and perisinusoidal ﬁbrosis is detected with
a trichrome stain. The terminal hepatic venules frequently are
obliterated, and indeed the zone 3 region of the liver acinus
shows the most prominent injury. Mallory bodies, eosinophilic-staining condensed cytoskeletal structures, are not
speciﬁc for alcoholic hepatitis. However, their presence in
association with other salient biopsy features strongly suggests
alcoholic hepatitis. Prominent neutrophilic inﬁltration of
hepatocytes containing Mallory bodies is termed satellitosis.
Giant mitochondria (megamitochondria) are another characteristic feature. In up to 50% of cases, concomitant cirrhosis
may be observed. Importantly, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis
cannot be differentiated reliably from alcoholic hepatitis
with liver biopsy specimens because of the overlap of histologic features.

Prognosis and Treatment
Abstinence

Abstinence is an important factor in both short- and longterm survival of patients with alcoholic hepatitis. For patients
who recover and remain abstinent, the disease may continue
to improve (ie, clinical sequelae and laboratory variables) for
as long as 6 months. Although the condition of some patients
continues to deteriorate even with abstinence, the 5-year survival rate for this group is more than 60%. However, for
patients who continue to drink, the 5-year survival rate is less
than 30%.
Nutrition

Malnutrition is almost universal among patients with alcoholic hepatitis because of concomitant poor dietary habits,
anorexia, and encephalopathy. Although malnutrition was
once thought to cause alcoholic liver disease, it is no longer
considered to have a major role in the pathogenesis of the disease. However, maintenance of a positive nitrogen balance
and provision of adequate energy requirements through nutritional support are a vital supportive treatment approach.
Patients with alcoholic hepatitis generally have greater protein
and energy needs because of the stress of illness and underlying malnutrition. Recommendations include 30 to 40 kcal/kg
ideal body weight of caloric supplementation and 1 to 1.5 g
protein/kg ideal body weight. Provision of nutrients in excess
of calculated requirements is unlikely to be of beneﬁt. Every
attempt should be made to provide adequate calories enterally. However, parenteral support may be necessary for
some patients. Encephalopathy should not require protein
restriction in most patients. For patients with severe encephalopathy that is exacerbated by dietary protein, branched chain
amino acid supplements should be considered or protein
intake should be decreased transiently. Increased use of
dietary vegetable protein may be better tolerated than animal
protein. Other than for this scenario, amino acid supplementation probably does not improve survival sufﬁciently for the
added cost.
Portal Hypertension

Patients with alcoholic hepatitis may develop complications of
portal hypertension regardless of the presence or absence of
underlying cirrhosis. This clinical observation is supported by
studies demonstrating that alcohol directly increases portal
pressure, and it emphasizes the importance of the vascular
component of intrahepatic resistance and portal hypertension. Hepatic encephalopathy, bleeding esophageal varices,
ascites, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, and hepatorenal
syndrome are complications of portal hypertension commonly encountered in patients with alcoholic hepatitis. The
management of these complications is discussed elsewhere in
this book.

25 Alcoholic Liver Disease

Infection

301

• Histologic features cannot reliably differentiate alcoholic hepatitis from nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. The
distinction is made best on the basis of the clinical history and the pattern of laboratory test results.
• For most patients, the treatment of alcoholic hepatitis
includes abstinence, supportive care, and management
of malnutrition, infection, and complications of portal
hypertension.

Because of underlying malnutrition, liver cirrhosis, and iatrogenic complications, infection is one of the most common
causes of death of patients with alcoholic hepatitis. The
patients must be evaluated carefully for infections, including
spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, aspiration pneumonia, and
lower extremity cellulitis. These infections should be treated
aggressively with antibiotics. However, fever and leukocytosis
are common in patients with alcoholic hepatitis, even without
infection.

Alcoholic Cirrhosis

Corticosteroids

Clinical Presentation

Corticosteroids have been studied extensively for the treatment of alcoholic hepatitis. Although many of the initial controlled trials did not show a beneﬁt, further analysis suggested
that patients with encephalopathy and more severe disease
may beneﬁt. Therefore, follow-up studies focused on the role
of corticosteroids in the treatment of patients who had a discriminant function greater than 32 or hepatic encephalopathy
(or both) but not renal failure, infection, gastrointestinal tract
bleeding, or, in some studies, severe diabetes mellitus. Some
studies and meta-analyses that used these criteria showed that
corticosteroid therapy had a survival beneﬁt for patients with a
discriminant function greater than 32 or hepatic encephalopathy (or both). Currently, the use of corticosteroid therapy for
alcoholic hepatitis varies among experienced hepatologists.

A 56-year-old salesman is admitted to the hospital with a
2-hour history of hematemesis and dizziness. His history is
remarkable for symptoms of fatigue and lower extremity
edema. His wife notes that his memory has been poor recently
and he has been a “social drinker” for many years, having a
few martinis with clients and during business trips. Physical
examination ﬁndings are notable for orthostasis, temporal
wasting, spider angiomas on the chest, and bilateral pitting
edema of the lower extremities. His skin is jaundiced, and a
liver edge is palpable and ﬁrm. The tip of the spleen is palpable
upon inspiration. Rectal examination shows melena in the
vault. There is prominent asterixis.
This patient has the clinical features typical of alcoholic cirrhosis. The diagnosis and treatment are discussed below.

Other Treatment Options

History and Physical Examination

Alcohol induces oxidative stress in the liver, resulting in an
imbalance between oxidants and antioxidants. To decrease
oxygen consumption by the liver, investigators have studied the
role of propylthiouracil in treating alcoholic hepatitis. Clinical
beneﬁt was noted by a randomized controlled trial, but the
results of follow-up studies have been inconclusive. Also,
because propylthiouracil is inherently hepatotoxic, it remains
an experimental drug. Another putative antiﬁbrotic agent,
colchicine, has been evaluated in treating alcoholic hepatitis.
Although an initial trial suggested that the drug was beneﬁcial
for treating alcoholic liver cirrhosis, a follow-up study was negative, and no clinical beneﬁt has been demonstrated for hepatitis.
Other hepatoprotective compounds, such as S-adenosyl-lmethionine and phosphatidylcholine, may have a small beneﬁcial effect but are not widely used outside of research protocols.
The results of a recent study have suggested that pentoxifylline,
an inhibitor of tumor necrosis factor, is of clinical beneﬁt.
Because the toxicity proﬁle of pentoxifylline is low, its use for
alcoholic hepatitis is prevalent; however, conﬁrmatory studies
are needed. Ongoing clinical studies are focusing on several different anticytokine and antioxidant therapies.

For persons with a clinical history of marked and prolonged
alcohol abuse, only about 20% eventually develop liver cirrhosis. The presence or absence of symptoms is due largely to
the presence or absence of liver decompensation. Patients with
cirrhosis and compensated liver function who are abstinent
may have minimal symptoms. The symptoms of patients with
liver decompensation reﬂect the severity of portal hypertension, malnutrition, and degree of synthetic liver dysfunction and include nonspeciﬁc fatigue, weakness, and anorexia.
More speciﬁc symptoms are related to the presence of speciﬁc
complications of cirrhosis and portal hypertension, including
gastrointestinal tract bleeding, ascites, encephalopathy, renal
failure, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Physical examination
may demonstrate stigmata of chronic liver disease (spider
angiomas and palmar erythema), complications of portal
hypertension (ascites, splenomegaly, asterixis, and pedal
edema), excess estrogen (gynecomastia and hypogonadism),
and systemic alcohol toxicity (peripheral neuropathy, dementia, and Dupuytren’s contracture).

• Liver biopsy should be considered if the cause of hepatitis is questioned and speciﬁc treatments for alcoholic
hepatitis other than supportive care are contemplated.

Laboratory and Radiographic Features

Prominent laboratory abnormalities include an increase in
prothrombin time and bilirubin and a decrease in albumin,

302

Section VI Liver

which are reﬂected in an increased Child-Pugh score. Imaging
ﬁndings may be suggestive of cirrhosis and ensuing portal
hypertension, as indicated by heterogeneous liver echotexture,
splenomegaly, collateralization, and ascites on ultrasonography and colloid shift to spleen and bone marrow on liver and
spleen scanning. Dynamic triple-phase computed tomography may show changes in liver contour, splenomegaly, collateralization, or ascites. Patients are at risk for hepatocellular
carcinoma and should be evaluated biannually with ultrasonography and the serum alpha-fetoprotein test, particularly
patients who have had recent clinical decompensation.
Histologic Features

Traditionally, alcoholic cirrhosis is classiﬁed as a micronodular cirrhosis (Fig. 25.2). However, in many cases, larger nodules also develop, leading to mixed micro-macronodular
cirrhosis. The earliest collagen deposition occurs around the
terminal hepatic venules, and progression to pericentral ﬁbrosis portends irreversible architectural changes. Hemosiderin
deposition is often prominent. In patients with alcoholic cirrhosis who continue to drink actively, many of the aforementioned histologic features of alcoholic hepatitis also are present.
Patients are at risk for hepatocellular carcinoma, particularly
those with coexisting chronic viral hepatitis.
Prognosis and Treatment

A good prognosis depends on the absence of liver decompensation and complications of portal hypertension and the ability to maintain abstinence. The prognosis for patients with
cirrhosis who are well compensated and able to maintain
abstinence is reasonably good, with a 5-year survival rate of
more than 80%. Even for patients with decompensation, the
5-year survival rate with abstinence is more than 50%.
However, patients who continue to drink have a much worse
prognosis, with a 5-year survival rate less than 30%.
The only established effective treatment for alcoholic cirrhosis is liver transplantation. Currently, alcoholic liver disease is one of the most common indications for liver
transplantation in adults in the United States. However, fewer
than 20% of patients with end-stage alcoholic liver disease
have transplantation. Despite perceptions to the contrary,
patients who have liver transplantation for alcoholic liver disease have survival rates after transplantation comparable to
those of patients who have transplantation for other indications. Indeed, the risk of cellular rejection is lower for persons
undergoing transplantation for alcoholic liver disease than for
those with other conditions.
A major issue in maintaining excellent outcome for this
population focuses on identifying candidates with a low risk of
recidivism after transplantation. Alcohol relapse after transplantation varies among centers and is difﬁcult to quantify
accurately, but it is probably about 15% to 30%. Although
detecting surreptitious alcohol use after transplantation is
often difﬁcult, the low incidence of graft loss from recurrent

alcoholic liver disease suggests that most patients who return
to drinking after transplantation do not drink to the point of
damaging the graft. However, it must be considered that alcohol abuse after liver transplantation can cause rapid development of cirrhosis in the graft, interfere with compliance in
taking immunosuppressive medications, and alter the perception of the general public of liver transplantation, thus
adversely affecting potential organ donors. Therefore, selecting patients who are appropriate for liver transplantation
requires a team involving a hepatologist, surgeon, addiction
specialist, psychiatrist, and social worker. Currently, many
transplant centers require 6 months of abstinence and appropriate addiction treatment before performing a liver transplant. Appropriate family and social support is also important.
Generally, patients with active alcoholic hepatitis are not candidates for liver transplantation because they have not been
abstinent for 6 months and they have high perioperative mortality. Also, many of these patients have evidence of marked
clinical improvement after 6 months of abstinence, thereby
delaying or obviating liver transplantation.
• Alcohol is a cause of micronodular cirrhosis, but often
mixed micro-macronodular cirrhosis is observed histologically.
• The only curative treatment for alcoholic cirrhosis is
liver transplantation; however, only a small proportion
of patients undergo transplantation, partly because of
their inability to maintain prolonged abstinence.
• Transplantation outcomes for alcoholic liver disease are
comparable to those for most other indications.

Special Clinical Situations
Alcohol and Hepatitis C

The increase in prevalence of HCV infection among alcoholic
persons is 10 times that of the population at large. Although
this may be explained partly by increased risk factors of HCV
transmission in some alcoholic patients, a proportion of these
patients have no identiﬁable risk factors. Also, patients with
HCV infection who are alcoholic or drink in excess have more
aggressive disease, often at a younger age, and have a worse
prognosis than patients who have only HCV infection.
Furthermore, HCV RNA levels are higher, the histologic features of the liver appear more progressive, and the response to
therapy for hepatitis C is worse for patients with HCV infection who drink alcohol in excess. Whether alcohol synergistically damages the liver in patients with HCV infection or,
alternatively, facilitates progression of HCV disease through
increased susceptibility by host immune factors is unclear.
Patients with alcoholic liver disease who have concomitant
viral hepatitis have a risk almost ﬁvefold greater for the development of hepatocellular carcinoma than patients without
concomitant viral hepatitis. Identifying which process is
causative in liver injury in patients with both conditions can

25 Alcoholic Liver Disease

be difﬁcult; however, assessing liver biopsy ﬁndings and aminotransferase patterns can be useful because both of these are
different in HCV infection and alcoholic liver injury. Because
the alcohol threshold necessary to exacerbate the course of
HCV infection has not been determined, patients with HCV
infection should be advised against alcohol use.
Alcohol and Acetaminophen

Alcoholic persons are at increased risk for acetaminopheninduced hepatotoxicity. As little as 2.5 to 3 g per day of acetaminophen may result in pronounced toxicity. The reason for
this is that both alcohol and acetaminophen are metabolized
in part by cytochrome P-450 2E1, an enzyme in MEOS. With
the induction of this enzyme by alcohol, a greater proportion
of acetaminophen is metabolized by this pathway than by the
sulfation and glucuronidation detoxiﬁcation pathways. The
byproduct of acetaminophen metabolism by CYP2E1 is
N-acetyl-p-benzoquinoneimine, which is toxic to the liver.
The accumulation of this compound in conjunction with
diminished antioxidant defenses in the liver (glutathione)
lowers the threshold of acetaminophen toxicity in alcoholic
persons. Thus, in this population, the clinical presentation of
acetaminophen toxicity is distinct from that of alcoholic hepatitis. Aminotransferase levels are markedly increased, often
more than 1,000 U/L, which is distinctly unusual for alcoholic
hepatitis.

Vascular Diseases of the Liver
Patrick S. Kamath, MD

Vascular diseases of the liver can be divided into disorders
of hepatic inﬂow (ie, diseases of the portal venous and
hepatic arterial inﬂow) and disorders of hepatic venous outﬂow (Table 26.1).
For a better understanding of the vascular diseases of the
liver, a concise review of the vascular anatomy of the liver is
important.

Anatomy of the Splanchnic Circulationa

The splanchnic circulation comprises the arterial blood supply
and venous drainage of the entire gastrointestinal tract from
the distal esophagus to the midrectum and includes the spleen,
pancreas, gallbladder, and liver. The arterial system is derived
from the celiac artery and the superior and inferior mesenteric
arteries. The superior mesenteric artery arises from the
abdominal aorta just distal to the celiac trunk. For most of its
course, this artery lies in the mesentery, with the ileocolic
artery being the terminal branch. The superior mesenteric
artery gives off three sets of branches: 1) several small branches
to the pancreas and duodenum before entering the mesentery,
2) three large arteries that supply the proximal two-thirds
of the large bowel, and 3) during its course through the mesenteric root, an arcade of arterial branches to supply the jejunum and ileum. The branches given off in the mesentery form
a row of arterial arcades that terminate in the arteriae rectae
of the wall of the small bowel. The venous drainage has a similar pattern, with the venae rectae forming a venous arcade
that drains the small bowel. These join with the ileocolic,
middle colic, and right colic veins to form the superior mesenteric vein.

Venoocclusive disease
Budd-Chiari syndrome

The arterial routes of the splanchnic circulation, except for
the hepatic artery, eventually empty into the portal venous
system through the splenic vein and superior and inferior
mesenteric veins. The portal vein, formed by the convergence
of the splenic and superior mesenteric veins, constitutes the
primary blood supply to the liver. After perfusing the liver,
venous blood reenters the systemic circulation through the
hepatic veins and suprahepatic inferior vena cava.
Reminiscent of the lungs, the liver receives a dual blood
supply. The two sources are portal venous blood (derived
from the mesenteric venous circulation, including the digestive tract, spleen, and pancreas) and hepatic arterial blood
(usually from the celiac artery). Total hepatic blood ﬂow constitutes nearly 30% of total cardiac output. The portal venous
inﬂow comprises 65% to 75% of hepatic blood inﬂow, and the
hepatic artery comprises approximately 25% to 35%. However,
approximately 50% of the liver’s oxygen requirements is delivered by hepatic arterial blood.
The hepatic vascular bed is a low-pressure system that can
maintain a large volume of blood. Sinusoidal blood collects
within terminal hepatic venules and reenters the systemic
circulation through the hepatic veins and inferior vena cava.

305

306

Section VI Liver

The caudate lobe of the liver maintains a separate drainage of
blood, accounting for the compensatory hypertrophy of this lobe
often observed in chronic liver disease associated with outﬂow
obstruction of the major hepatic veins (Budd-Chiari syndrome).

Disorders of Portal Venous Inﬂow
Acute Mesenteric Venous Thrombosis

Acute mesenteric venous thrombosis is discussed in Chapter 12,
“Vascular Disorders of the Gastrointestinal Tract.”
Chronic Mesenteric Venous Thrombosis

Chronic mesenteric venous thrombosis is very different from
the acute form. Lack of visualization of the superior mesenteric vein on computed tomography or duplex ultrasonography in conjunction with extensive collateral venous drainage
suggests the diagnosis of chronic mesenteric venous thrombosis. Angiography can help conﬁrm the diagnosis but rarely
is required. Although many patients present with nonspeciﬁc
symptoms of several months’ duration, an increasing proportion are being identiﬁed through imaging studies performed
for unrelated reasons. These patients may be asymptomatic
with respect to the primary event; hence, the time of the
thrombotic event often is unclear. Patients in whom the
thrombosis extends to involve the portal vein or splenic vein
(or both) may experience portal hypertension and esophageal
varices, with the attendant complications of variceal bleeding.
They also may have splenomegaly and hypersplenism. Chronic
mesenteric venous thrombosis should be differentiated from
isolated splenic vein thrombosis due to pancreatic neoplasm
or chronic pancreatitis. The latter, often called sinistral (or
left-sided) portal hypertension, is related to a local effect on the
splenic vein and is not usually a disorder of the thrombotic
pathway. Thus, anticoagulation is not warranted for sinistral
portal hypertension.
Patients with isolated chronic mesenteric venous thrombosis often remain asymptomatic because of extensive collateral
venous drainage. Occasionally, some patients have gastrointestinal tract hemorrhage, and the use of pharmacologic agents
such as propranolol is recommended to prevent variceal
bleeding. Endoscopic therapy is used both to control active
bleeding and to prevent rebleeding. Surgical intervention,
such as portosystemic shunts, is restricted to patients whose
bleeding cannot be controlled with conservative measures and
who have a patent central vein for shunting. When thrombosis is extensive and no large vein is suitable for anastomosis,
nonconventional shunts may be considered, such as anastomosing a large collateral vein with a systemic vein. Also, gastroesophageal devascularization may be considered. For
patients with thrombophilia, anticoagulation may be initiated
after the risk of bleeding has been decreased by use of
β-blockers or, if bleeding has occurred, by surgical stents.

Disorders of Hepatic Arterial Inﬂow
Hepatic Artery Thrombosis

Aside from patients who have had liver transplantation, the
prevalence of hepatic artery thrombosis is not certain. Hepatic
artery thrombosis is the cause of considerable morbidity and
mortality in approximately 7% of adults and in perhaps as
many as 40% of pediatric patients undergoing orthotopic liver
transplantation. The problem is more extensive in the pediatric age group because of the small caliber of the vessels involved
and the probable greater ﬂuctuation in the concentration of
coagulation factors.
Several risk factors are related to the development of hepatic
artery thrombosis in adults, with technical aspects of the
arterial anastomosis being the most important risk of early
thrombosis. Other risk factors are older recipients, clotting
abnormalities, tobacco use, and infections by agents such as
cytomegalovirus. Late hepatic artery thrombosis has been
associated with chronic rejection and blood-type–incompatible
grafts.
The clinical presentation of hepatic artery thrombosis
can vary from a mild increase in the serum level of aminotransferases to fulminant hepatic necrosis. The acute presentation, or early hepatic artery thrombosis, has a more
severe clinical course, and late hepatic artery thrombosis
generally has a milder course. There is no agreement about
the time point between early and late hepatic artery thrombosis. However, the later that hepatic artery thrombosis
develops after liver transplantation, the less severe the clinical
presentation.
Early hepatic artery thrombosis results in massive injury to
hepatocytes and bile duct epithelial cells. Ischemic damage to
the bile ducts leads to dehiscence of the biliary anastomosis,
bile duct strictures, and intrahepatic abscesses. Thus, biliary
sepsis may be a common presentation of early hepatic artery
thrombosis. However, one-third of episodes of early hepatic
artery thrombosis may be asymptomatic.
Hepatic artery thrombosis can be diagnosed with duplex
ultrasonography, but angiography may be necessary to conﬁrm the diagnosis. When hepatic artery thrombosis is detected
early after liver transplantation, surgical correction usually is
recommended.
Hepatic Artery Aneurysm

Although aneurysm of the hepatic artery (Fig. 26.1) is rare, it
is the fourth most common abdominal aneurysm. The aneurysms are usually small (<2 cm in diameter) and involve the
main hepatic artery. Causes of hepatic artery aneurysms
include atherosclerotic vascular diseases, infections such as
bacterial endocarditis, liver abscess, syphilis, tuberculosis, and
trauma from liver biopsy. The hepatic artery commonly is
involved in polyarteritis nodosa, manifested as symptoms
related to thrombosis, rupture, or dissection of the aneurysm.

26 Vascular Diseases of the Liver

307

The best treatment is embolization and occlusion of the ﬁstula, except in the presence of HHT, when embolization is
absolutely contraindicated.
Ischemic Hepatitis

Figure 26.1 Selective hepatic angiogram showing an aneurysm

(arrow) of the intrahepatic portion of the hepatic artery.

Most hepatic artery aneurysms are discovered incidentally. If
symptomatic, the ﬁrst and dominating symptom is severe
abdominal pain, suggesting dissection. Vague abdominal pain in
these patients is related to compression of surrounding structures. Rupture of a hepatic artery aneurysm causes massive intraperitoneal hemorrhage or hemobilia manifested as abdominal
pain, jaundice, and gastrointestinal tract bleeding. Hemobilia is
usually a manifestation of an intrahepatic aneurysm.
The treatment for a ruptured aneurysm is emergency surgery or embolization of the aneurysm in patients who are not
optimal candidates for surgery. For asymptomatic patients,
treatment is debated. Clearly, aneurysms larger than 2 cm in
diameter require treatment, and those between 1 and 2 cm in
diameter may be treated. For aneurysms less than 1 cm in diameter, follow-up at 6-month intervals is reasonable. Treatment
includes interventional radiologic approaches to embolize and
occlude the aneurysm, ligation at surgery, or excision of the
aneurysm and reconstruction of the artery. Intrahepatic aneurysms may be treated also with liver resection.
Hepatic Artery–Portal Vein Fistulas

Hepatic artery–portal vein ﬁstulas are rare causes of portal
hypertension. Although ﬁstulas within the liver usually are
iatrogenic (the result of liver biopsy), they may be related to
neoplasms or hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT)
(Osler-Weber-Rendu disease). A hepatic artery–portal vein
ﬁstula should be suspected in a patient who has acute onset of
abdominal pain and ascites, especially if associated with gastrointestinal tract bleeding, because rupture of the artery into
the portal vein causes an acute increase in portal pressure.
These ﬁstulas may be accompanied by abdominal bruits in
most patients. Hepatic artery–portal vein ﬁstulas are treated
with coil embolization or surgical ligation. If untreated, a
hepatic artery–hepatic vein ﬁstula may result in cardiac failure.

In patients with congestive heart failure, portal blood ﬂow is
minimal; thus, the major contribution of oxygenated blood to
the liver is from the hepatic artery. In congestive heart failure,
episodes of hypotension, as associated with arrhythmias,
diminish hepatic arterial input and result in ischemic necrosis
of the liver. Typical manifestations of ischemic hepatitis are a
rapid increase over 24 to 48 hours in the serum level of aminotransferases (aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase) to several thousand units, sometimes more than
10,000 U/L. This value rapidly returns to less than 100 U/L in
5 to 7 days. No speciﬁc treatment is required other than control of the cardiac condition. Extensive ischemic hepatitis may
result in acute liver failure.
Other causes of ischemic hepatitis are hypovolemic shock of
any cause and obstructive sleep apnea. Postoperative patients
particularly are prone to ischemic liver damage because they
often have coexisting arterial hypotension and hypoxemia.
Furthermore, hepatic blood ﬂow may be reduced by anesthetic
agents. This problem may be of particular concern in patients
who have open heart surgery. The typical histologic ﬁnding in
these patients with ischemic liver damage is centrilobular
hepatic necrosis (zone 3). The severity of liver damage is related
to the duration of hypotension and the degree of hypoxemia.
Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia

The criteria for diagnosing HHT include a history of epistaxis,
a family history of HHT, mucocutaneous telangiectasia, and
visceral involvement, which can be hepatic, gastrointestinal,
neurologic, or pulmonary. Three of these criteria are required
for the diagnosis of HHT.
The vascular malformation within the liver of patients with
HHT results in ﬁstulas 1) between the hepatic artery and
hepatic vein (the most common abnormality), 2) between the
hepatic artery and portal vein, or 3) between the portal vein
and hepatic vein (or a combination of these three). Previously,
the most common liver disease in patients with HHT was
transfusion-related hepatitis, but currently the most common
manifestation is high-output cardiac failure as a result of
hepatic artery-to-hepatic vein ﬁstulas. Additional abnormalities include recurrent cholangitis due to the diversion of
hepatic arterial blood, either to the hepatic vein or portal vein;
portal hypertension as a result of hepatic artery–portal vein
ﬁstulas, or nodular regenerative hyperplasia; and hepatic
encephalopathy because of ﬁstulas between the portal vein
and hepatic vein. Embolization of these ﬁstulas is not recommended because of the high risk of liver abscesses. This likely
is related to most patients having some degree of portal vein–
hepatic vein ﬁstula, and once the hepatic artery is occluded,

308

Section VI Liver

there is neither hepatic arterial nor portal venous blood to the
involved segment of the liver. Liver transplantation has been
performed to treat HHT and is best indicated for patients who
have recurrent cholangitis.

Disorders of Hepatic Venous Outﬂow

no response to thrombolytic therapy, either a surgical shunt or
transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) may be
used. Although the initial results with portosystemic shunts
may be beneﬁcial, the long-term outcome for patients who
require shunts is poor because these patients usually have
severe venoocclusive disease and intervention generally delays
but does not prevent a fatal outcome.

Venoocclusive Disease

Budd-Chiari Syndrome

Venoocclusive disease, or sinusoidal obstruction syndrome,
results from occlusion of the central and sublobular hepatic
veins. In the United States, the most common cause of
venoocclusive disease is preconditioning for bone marrow
transplantation. Other causes include radiation to the liver,
antineoplastic drugs such as azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine, and ingestion of alkaloids containing pyrrolizidine.
The following discussion is predominantly on venoocclusive disease of the liver in relation to patients undergoing bone
marrow transplantation. For these patients, the incidence of
venoocclusive disease was approximately 50% when cyclophosphamide and total body irradiation were used as intensive conditioning before transplant and the mortality rate was
20% to 40%. Currently, the incidence of venoocclusive disease
is low because cyclophosphamide and high-dose irradiation
are no longer used. Early changes are related to hemorrhage in
zone 3, as seen in liver biopsy specimens. Diagnostic criteria
include subendothelial thickening of at least one terminal
hepatic venule in association with luminal narrowing.
The pathogenesis of venoocclusive disease is not well
deﬁned. It probably results from a combination of endothelial
injury and activation of clotting mechanisms. It has been
hypothesized that the depletion of glutathione in zone 3 hepatocytes makes them more prone to damage by antineoplastic
agents such as busulfan. The resulting accumulation of oxygen
free radicals leads to zone 3 necrosis and subsequent endothelial damage.
Clinical criteria for diagnosing venoocclusive disease are
either the Seattle or the Baltimore criteria. The Baltimore criteria reﬂect more severe venoocclusive disease and require a
weight gain of more than 5% in association with hepatomegaly and ascites. The Seattle criteria require a bilirubin level
higher than 2 mg/dL in association with hepatomegaly, right
upper quadrant pain, and a weight gain of more than 2%.
According to both the Baltimore and Seattle criteria, the criteria should be met within 3 weeks after bone marrow transplantation. Bilirubin levels higher than 15 mg/dL are associated
with poor outcome.
Treatment of venoocclusive disease is difﬁcult. Prophylactic
strategies have included administration of heparin, prostaglandins, or ursodeoxycholic acid. Because of the lack of large
randomized studies, it is difﬁcult to determine the beneﬁts of
any of these therapies. The treatment of established venoocclusive disease also is debated. Tissue plasminogen activator
and heparin have been administered to patients at high risk
for dying of complications of venoocclusive disease. If there is

Budd-Chiari syndrome is a heterogenous group of disorders
characterized by obstruction of hepatic venous outﬂow. The
site of obstruction may be at the level of small hepatic venules,
large hepatic veins, or the inferior vena cava. Obstruction at
the level of the central and sublobular hepatic venules traditionally has been called hepatic venoocclusive disease. In countries such as Japan and India, obstruction of the inferior vena
cava by membranes or webs or segmental narrowing of the
vessel also may obstruct hepatic venous outﬂow.
Etiology

The main causes predisposing to Budd-Chiari syndrome
include a hypercoagulable state, tumor invasion of the hepatic
venous outﬂow tract, and miscellaneous causes. In some
patients, no clear etiologic factor is discernible. Increasingly,
the presence of multiple underlying disorders that cause BuddChiari syndrome is being recognized.
Hematologic abnormalities are detected in up to 87.5% of
patients with Budd-Chiari syndrome, particularly myeloproliferative disorders. Overt polycythemia vera is the most
common disorder encountered. Erythropoietin levels and
demonstration of JAK mutations have been used to diagnose
occult primary myeloproliferative disorders in patients otherwise thought to have idiopathic Budd-Chiari syndrome. Both
fulminant and chronic forms of the syndrome have been
described in patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria. Increasingly, inherited deﬁciencies of protein C, protein S, and antithrombin are being reported in association
with the syndrome. Protein C and protein S are vitamin Kdependent proteins that are synthesized in the liver and
endothelial cells and act as ﬁbrinolytic agents. Antithrombin is
a vitamin K-independent protease inhibitor that is synthesized
in the liver and neutralizes activated clotting factors by forming a complex with a speciﬁc serine protease. Deﬁciencies of
any of these proteins can result in both arterial and venous
thrombosis, but the correlation between protein C and protein S levels and the risk of thrombosis is not precise. In several
patients with Budd-Chiari syndrome, protein C deﬁciency has
been associated also with an underlying myeloproliferative
disorder. The diagnosis is sometimes difﬁcult because these
proteins can become deﬁcient in patients with impaired liver
function. Normal levels of factors II and VII in patients
with Budd-Chiari syndrome or deﬁciencies of protein C and
protein S in family members may point toward an inherited
disorder.

26 Vascular Diseases of the Liver

The factor V Leiden mutation has been reported in approximately 23% of patients with Budd-Chiari syndrome. This
mutation, caused by the substitution of an arginine residue by
glutamine at position 506 in the factor V molecule, abolishes a
protein C cleavage site in factor V and prolongs the thrombogenic effect of factor V activation. The term resistance to activated protein C is another name for this condition. Although
about 2.9% to 6% of people of European descent are believed
to be heterozygous for this mutation, the relative risk of
thrombosis is thought to be low. In addition to being a sole
cause of Budd-Chiari syndrome, this mutation has been
reported to occur also in combination with other prothrombotic disorders.
Clinical Manifestations

The underlying pathophysiologic abnormality in Budd-Chiari
syndrome is an increase in sinusoidal pressure caused by
obstruction of hepatic venous outﬂow. This results in hypoxic
damage to the hepatocytes and increased portal venous pressure. Continued obstruction of hepatic venous outﬂow leads to
further hepatic necrosis, ultimately resulting in cirrhosis.
Because the caudate lobe drains directly into the inferior vena
cava, it is not damaged. In fact, the caudate lobe hypertrophies,
and this may, to various degrees, obstruct the inferior vena cava.
The clinical presentation of Budd-Chiari syndrome depends on
the extent and rapidity of the occlusion of the hepatic vein and
whether collateral circulation has developed to decompress the
liver. Vague right upper quadrant abdominal pain is the most
common presenting symptom of the syndrome, and ascites is
the most common abnormality noted on physical examination.
Some patients with hepatic vein thrombosis are asymptomatic,
presumably as a result of occlusion of only one or two hepatic
veins and decompression of the portal system through the development of large intrahepatic and portosystemic collaterals.
Investigations

Doppler ultrasonography of the liver is the initial investigation of choice in patients with suspected Budd-Chiari syndrome. It demonstrates the hepatic veins, splenic vein, portal
vein, and inferior vena cava. Necrotic areas are seen better
with contrast-enhanced computed tomography and magnetic
resonance imaging.
Venography or liver biopsy is not necessary after BuddChiari syndrome has been diagnosed with noninvasive studies. However, if the clinical suspicion of Budd-Chiari syndrome
is high, especially in a patient with a fulminant or acute presentation, contrast venography may be necessary if radiologic
imaging is not diagnostic. The characteristic appearance of the
hepatic veins in Budd-Chiari syndrome is that of a spider’s
web, with an extensive collateral circulation. Also, the inferior
vena cava may be compressed by an enlarged caudate lobe or
it may show thrombus.
In addition to establishing the diagnosis of hepatic vein
thrombosis, it is important to identify an underlying cause to

determine management strategies. An appropriate hematologic work-up should be performed to exclude the various disorders outlined in Table 26.2, including demonstrating JAK2
mutations to determine if the patient has a myeloproliferative
disorder.
Management

The aims of treatment of Budd-Chiari syndrome are to relieve
obstruction of the hepatic outﬂow tract, to identify and treat
the underlying cause, and to relieve symptoms. Treatment
options include medical management, surgical portosystemic
shunting, TIPS, and liver transplantation (Table 26.3). Although
most patients who have Budd-Chiari syndrome can be
offered some form of deﬁnitive therapy, those in whom the
syndrome is due to extensive malignant disease are offered
only palliative care because of the extremely poor prognosis of
this condition.
Medical management consists of diuretic therapy for the
treatment of ascites, anticoagulation to prevent extension of
venous thrombosis, and treatment of the underlying cause.

Approximately 20% of patients can be managed with this
approach. If this approach fails, intervention to enhance
hepatic venous outﬂow is the next step. Ideal candidates for
angioplasty include patients with inferior vena cava webs or
focal hepatic vein stenosis; thrombolytic therapy is used infrequently but is administered best by direct infusion to the site
of the clot.
The aim of portosystemic shunting is to use the portal vein
to provide a venous outﬂow tract for the liver to reverse
hepatic necrosis and to prevent chronic sequelae of obstruction of hepatic venous outﬂow. The optimal candidates for
surgical shunting are patients with a subacute presentation in
whom ascites is not severe, liver function is preserved, and the
disease course is smoldering. Patients with acute Budd-Chiari
syndrome may need a less invasive procedure, such as TIPS.
Covered stents have increased the long-term patency of TIPS,
making this the preferred method of performing a portosystemic shunt in most patients. Indications for liver transplantation in Budd-Chiari syndrome include 1) end-stage
chronic liver disease, 2) fulminant liver failure, and 3) deterioration of liver function in spite of portosystemic shunting.

Portal Hypertension-Related Bleeding
Patrick S. Kamath, MD

Portal hypertensive bleeding encompasses a spectrum of conditions that include esophageal, gastric, and ectopic varices
and portal hypertensive gastrointestinal enteropathy. Esophageal variceal hemorrhage occurs through a combination of
increased portal pressure and local factors within the varix
itself. Management of esophageal varices includes primary
prophylaxis of variceal hemorrhage, treatment of actively
bleeding varices, and prevention of variceal rebleeding (secondary prophylaxis). The choice of therapy for primary prophylaxis depends on patient preferences and includes
pharmacologic therapy with β-blockers or variceal band ligation, especially if β-blocker therapy fails or the therapy is not
tolerated by the patient. Active bleeding is best treated endoscopically. A combination of pharmacologic and endoscopic
therapy is preferred for secondary prophylaxis. Surgical shunts
or transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunts (TIPSs) are
second-line therapy.

Portal hypertension is maintained through the development
of a systemic hyperdynamic circulation and peripheral vasodilation. The hyperdynamic circulation is characterized in the
splanchnic circulation by vasodilation and increased ﬂow at
the level of the splanchnic arterioles. This leads to increased
portal venous inﬂow and exacerbates the existing portal hypertension. Drugs such as octreotide and vasopressin reduce
splanchnic hyperemia and portal venous inﬂow. Portal hypertension results in the development of collateral circulation,
which may decrease portal pressure. In addition to esophageal
and gastric varices, gastric and intestinal vascular ectasia and
portal hypertensive gastropathy occur in patients who have
portal hypertension.

Esophageal Varices
Pathogenesis

Pathogenesis of Portal Hypertensiona

An increase in the hepatic venous pressure gradient—the difference between the wedged hepatic venous pressure and the
free hepatic venous pressure—of at least 10 mm Hg is required
for the development of esophageal varices, and a hepatic
venous pressure gradient of 12 mm Hg or more is required for
the rupture of esophageal varices.
In cirrhosis, portal hypertension occurs through an increase
in resistance to portal venous outﬂow early in the disease
process. This increase is due to mechanical factors related to
the distortion of liver architecture. However, approximately
30% of the increase in resistance occurs through potentially
reversible vascular factors and is the target of pharmacotherapy.
Abbreviation: TIPS, transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt

Local factors that determine the risk of hemorrhage from
esophageal varices include the radius of the varix, the thickness of the varix wall, and the pressure gradient between
the varix and the esophageal lumen. Factors that determine
the severity of bleeding are the degree of liver dysfunction
and defective coagulation, portal pressure, and the size
of the rent in the varix. Endoscopic sclerotherapy or band
ligation attempts to decrease ﬂow through the varix by
inducing thrombosis and, ultimately, obliteration of
varices.
Therapy

The current recommendations for treatment are summarized
in the Table 27.1.

Primary Prophylaxis

All patients with cirrhosis should have endoscopy to screen for
the presence and size of esophageal varices. Capsule endoscopy and computed tomography are promising methods for
detecting varices but, currently, are not recommended for
screening. Large varices (>5 mm in diameter) are seen in 16%
of patients who undergo screening for varices by endoscopy.
In approximately 25% of patients with large varices, varices
bleed, usually within the ensuing 2 years. For patients with
large varices and advanced liver disease, the risk of hemorrhage can be as high as 75%. Thus, prophylactic therapy is
indicated for patients with large varices. The presence or
absence of high-risk endoscopic signs such as red wales does
not inﬂuence the decision to initiate therapy. Prophylactic
treatment may be considered also for patients with ChildPugh class C status and small varices. If no varices are detected
at endoscopy, the procedure should be repeated in 2 or 3 years
to screen for varices.
The established primary prophylaxis is treatment with
nonselective β-adrenergic blocking agents (β-blockers) such
as propranolol and nadolol or with endoscopic variceal ligation. It is important to use only nonselective agents rather
than β1-selective agents. β1-Blockade decreases cardiac output
and splanchnic blood ﬂow, whereas the additional β2-blockade
allows unopposed α1-adrenergic constriction in the splanchnic circulation. This decreases portal blood ﬂow and, consequently, portal pressure. Therapy is started at a low dose, with
slow upward titration of the dose until a resting pulse rate of
55 to 60 beats/minute is achieved or hypotension develops
(systolic blood pressure <90 mm Hg). A long-acting preparation of propranolol administered as a single dose in the early
evening is preferred. This allows adequate β-blockade at night,
when the risk of bleeding is high. With the long-acting preparation administered in the evening, β-blockade is less during
the following day, thus decreasing the side effect of fatigue.
At the same time, the risk of bleeding is lower during the
day, and the lesser degree of β-blockade is not deleterious to
the patient. Whenever possible, the hemodynamic response
to pharmacologic therapy should be measured. The goal of

therapy is to decrease the hepatic venous pressure gradient to
less than 12 mm Hg or by 20% when compared with baseline.
Nitrates have no place in primary prophylaxis, either when
administered as single agents or in combination with
β-blockers. Carvedilol, a nonselective β-blocker with additional α1-blocking properties, is another agent that might be
used for primary prophylaxis.
Although sclerotherapy is no longer used as a form of primary prophylaxis, variceal band ligation may be an alternative
approach to primary prophylaxis because of the lower rate of
esophageal ulceration and more effective obliteration of
variceal structures than with sclerotherapy. Currently, esophageal variceal ligation is recommended for patients who have
contraindications to therapy with β-blockers, who have not
had a decrease in the hepatic vein pressure gradient, or who
have experienced adverse effects from β-blocker therapy.
A meta-analysis of all the studies that compared β-blockers
and endoscopic variceal ligation showed no signiﬁcant difference in mortality risk between the two treatments, but with
variceal ligation, there was a decrease in the risk of bleeding.
Often, patient preference may be the factor that best determines which therapy is used.
Control of Esophageal Variceal Hemorrhage

Active esophageal variceal bleeding is managed best by endoscopic means, preferably variceal band ligation. After gastrointestinal tract bleeding has been detected in patients with
cirrhosis, immediate initiation of pharmacologic therapy is
beneﬁcial—even before endoscopy has demonstrated variceal
bleeding. Pharmacologic therapy is continued for up to 5 days
after endoscopic treatment of varices to reduce the risk of
immediate rebleeding. Vasopressin is a potent splanchnic
vasoconstrictor that decreases portal venous inﬂow, thereby
decreasing portal pressure, but it is seldom used. Nitroglycerin
is used only in conjunction with vasopressin to further decrease
portal pressure and reduce the ischemic side effects of vasopressin, which are pronounced and limit therapy in up to 30%
of patients. Octreotide, a long-acting synthetic somatostatin
analogue, is the pharmacologic agent most commonly used. It
appears to decrease portal pressure by inhibiting the release of
glucagon and the ensuing postprandial hyperemia and by
having a direct vasoconstrictive effect on splanchnic arteriolar
smooth muscle. Although octreotide is safer than vasopressin,
the efﬁcacy of the compound has not been well established.
However, a recent meta-analysis has suggested that octreotide
is beneﬁcial for acute bleeding. Octreotide is administered
as an initial bolus of 50 μg, followed by an infusion at
50 μg/hour for 5 days in conjunction with endoscopic variceal
band ligation.
For treating active bleeding, the use of TIPS is limited to
patients with refractory bleeding or immediate rebleeding
after two separate unsuccessful attempts at endoscopic intervention performed within 24 hours. TIPS is preferred to
surgical intervention, particularly in patients with Child-Pugh
class B or C status. Also, gastric varices can be obliterated

27 Portal Hypertension-Related Bleeding

concomitantly with TIPS through the injection of gel foam or
coils into the gastroesophageal collateral vessels.
Supportive and resuscitative care includes airway protection, volume replacement, treatment of coagulopathy, and
vigorous surveillance and treatment of concomitant infection.
Maintenance of a hematocrit of 25% is appropriate because
aggressive transfusion of blood products may precipitate further bleeding by increasing portal pressure. Antibiotic prophylaxis for 7 days with norﬂoxacin, 400 mg twice daily, is
recommended to decrease the incidence of bacteremia and
spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, which commonly accompany variceal hemorrhage. Antibiotic therapy is probably the
most important reason why the mortality rate of variceal
bleeding has decreased from 50% to about 20%. Lactulose
therapy may be instituted to treat hepatic encephalopathy.
When quinolone resistance is likely, ceftriaxone is administered intravenously in a dose of 1 g every 24 hours.
Secondary Prophylaxis

Secondary prophylaxis involves therapies to prevent rebleeding in patients who have already bled from esophageal varices.
Intervention is essential because up to 80% of patients who
have already bled from varices will bleed again within 2 years.
Treatments include pharmacotherapy with β-blockers, either
alone or in combination with oral nitrates, endoscopic band
ligation, TIPS, and surgical shunts. Either β-blockers or endoscopic therapy is an appropriate treatment option for patients
who did not receive β-blockers for primary prophylaxis. Band
ligation is the preferred endoscopic treatment because of the
lower incidence of esophageal ulceration and ease of therapy.
After acute bleeding has been controlled with variceal ligation,
the next ligation session is scheduled in approximately 10 to
14 days. Subsequent sessions are scheduled every 3 or 4 weeks.
Varices usually can be obliterated over several weekly sessions.
Combination therapy of band ligation and β-blockers is
preferred to either treatment used alone.
For patients in whom primary prophylaxis with β-blockers
failed, the addition of oral nitrates to the pharmacologic regimen may further decrease portal pressure and the incidence of
rebleeding. However, concern remains about the long-term
effects of oral nitrates on patient survival; therefore, endoscopic obliteration in combination with β-blockers is currently the preferred approach for secondary prophylaxis for
patients in whom primary prophylaxis with β-blockers failed.
TIPS should be used only in patients with recurrent or refractory bleeding despite pharmacologic and endoscopic therapies, especially if they are candidates for liver transplantation.
There is hesitation in recommending widespread use of TIPS
because of the risk of worsening encephalopathy, the potential
for liver deterioration, and uncertain effects on long-term survival, particularly of patients with advanced dysfunction of
liver synthesis. A surgical shunt should be considered for
patients with Child-Pugh class A status and patients for
whom continued medical surveillance will be unlikely, because
TIPS requires close ultrasonographic follow-up of the shunt

313

to evaluate for restenosis. The type of surgical shunt used
depends on institutional expertise and the patient’s potential
as a candidate for liver transplantation. All appropriate
patients who have variceal hemorrhage should be evaluated
for liver transplantation.

Portal Hypertensive Lesions in
the Stomach

Gastric lesions that cause portal hypertensive bleeding include
gastric varices, portal hypertensive gastropathy, and gastric
vascular ectasia. Because no evidence-based management
strategies are available for gastric sources of portal hypertensive bleeding, therapy often requires an empiric approach.
Gastric Varices

The most common type of gastric varices is esophageal varices
that extend into the cardia of the stomach and are readily
treated with endoscopic techniques such as sclerotherapy or
band ligation. Varices in the fundus of the stomach, either as
an extension of esophageal varices or as isolated gastric fundal
varices, are the most common source of gastric variceal bleeding. Recent data have suggested that the frequency of bleeding
from gastric varices is similar to that from large esophageal
varices. Gastric varices are more likely to be found in patients
who have had bleeding from esophageal varices than in those
who have not had bleeding. The risk of bleeding from gastric
varices is related to the size of the varix, liver function as determined by the Child-Pugh class, and the presence of red signs
on the varix.
β-Blockers are recommended for primary prophylaxis of
gastric varices. Acute gastric variceal bleeding is treated best
endoscopically with injection of cyanoacrylate glue. Currently,
however, this is not readily available in the United States.
Other options include sclerotherapy with ethanolamine oleate
or thrombin, but the success rate has varied. Gastric variceal
ligation should be limited to varices in the cardia.
Although pharmacologic therapy, for example, β-blockers,
may be used to prevent gastric variceal rebleeding, no studies
support this practice. Our policy generally has been to consider a portosystemic shunt for the prevention of rebleeding in
patients with documented gastric fundal variceal bleeding if
variceal obturation with cyanoacrylate is not possible. TIPS is
used for patients with poor liver function; patients with ChildPugh class A status should be considered for portosystemic
shunt surgery.
Portal Hypertensive Gastropathy

Portal hypertensive gastropathy is a source of gastrointestinal
tract bleeding in some patients with cirrhosis and portal
hypertension. The elementary lesion is a mosaic-like pattern
of the gastric mucosa, but this is not speciﬁc. The more speciﬁc lesion is the red marking, which may be either a red point

314

Section VI Liver

lesion less than 1 mm in diameter or a cherry red spot more
than 2 mm in diameter. The presence of a mosaic-like pattern
alone designates mild portal hypertensive gastropathy, whereas
red markings superimposed on the mosaic pattern suggest
severe portal hypertensive gastropathy. Lesions of portal
hypertensive gastropathy tend to be more common in the
proximal stomach, in patients with advanced stages of liver
disease as noted by the Child-Pugh classiﬁcation, in patients
with esophageal varices, and in patients who previously have
had esophageal variceal therapy. These lesions also are more
common in patients with gastric varices. Approximately 3% of
patients with severe gastropathy may present with acute upper
gastrointestinal tract bleeding, and approximately 15% have
chronic bleeding.
Anecdotally, acute bleeding from portal hypertensive gastropathy has been treated, with a high success rate, with vasoactive drugs such as vasopressin, somatostatin, and octreotide.
Portosystemic shunts should be considered as rescue treatments if vasoactive drug therapy fails. Patients who present
with chronic bleeding may be treated with iron supplementation and β-blockers. For these patients, treatment should be
continued indeﬁnitely or until liver transplantation. Portosystemic shunts may be used as rescue treatment in patients
who continue to be transfusion-dependent in spite of adequate
β-blocker therapy.

B

Gastric Vascular Ectasia

A less common gastric mucosal lesion in portal hypertension
is gastric vascular ectasia. In contrast to portal hypertensive
gastropathy, gastric vascular ectasia is characterized by red
markings in the absence of a mosaic-like pattern. The red
markings may be arranged in linear aggregates in the antrum,
for which the term gastric antral vascular ectasia (or watermelon stomach) is used (Fig. 27.1). If the red markings do not
have a typical linear arrangement, the lesion is designated diffuse gastric vascular ectasia. The diffuse lesions also may involve
the proximal stomach, sometimes making differentiation
from severe portal hypertensive gastropathy difﬁcult. When
the diagnosis is uncertain, gastric mucosal biopsy, which usually is safe, may be helpful. Liver dysfunction seems to be necessary for the pathogenesis of vascular ectasia because these
lesions may resolve with liver transplantation.
Treatment of gastric vascular ectasia is difﬁcult. Some
patients may be managed only with iron replacement therapy.
β-Blockers do not seem to be effective for these lesions,
although controlled trials have not been conducted because of
the rarity of gastric vascular ectasia. Thermoablative therapies,
such as argon plasma coagulation, may be tried, but the results,
especially in the diffuse form, are poor. Cryotherapy may be
successful in controlling bleeding in patients with the diffuse
variety of vascular ectasia. Antrectomy is effective, but the
mortality and morbidity related to the operation can be
substantial for patients with cirrhosis. These lesions do not
respond to portosystemic shunts, either surgical or TIPS,

aggregates of red markings in the antrum and the absence of an
underlying mosaic-like pattern.

but occasionally may respond to estrogen-progesterone combinations. We typically prescribe a combination of mestranol,
50 mg, with norethindrone, 1 mg daily, for these patients.

Ascites, Hepatorenal Syndrome,
and Encephalopathy
J. Eileen Hay, MB, ChB

The portal hypertension and hepatic synthetic dysfunction of
cirrhosis cause three main complications as liver disease progresses: variceal bleeding, ascites, and hepatic encephalopathy.
(Variceal bleeding is discussed in Chapter 27.)

Ascitesa

Ascites is the most common major complication of cirrhosis
and occurs in about 50% of patients with compensated cirrhosis in 10 years. The development of ascites denotes the
transition from compensated to decompensated cirrhosis. It
causes increased morbidity from abdominal distention and
increased mortality from complications such as spontaneous
bacterial peritonitis and renal dysfunction, with 15% and 44%
of patients dying in 1 and 5 years, respectively.
Pathogenesis of Ascites

The hemodynamic changes in chronic liver disease and portal
hypertension are much better understood now and have led to
a greater understanding of the pathogenesis of ascites.
Increased hydrostatic pressure within hepatic sinusoids occurs
from structural changes due to architectural distortion by
ﬁbrosis and nodular regeneration (about 70% of the increase),
with 20% to 30% of the increase from increased intrahepatic
vascular tone due to vasoactive factors. This increase in hepatic

Liver Disease; ADH, antidiuretic hormone; CTP, Child-TurcottePugh; MELD, model for end-stage liver disease; PMN, polymorphonuclear neutrophil; PSE, portosystemic encephalopathy;
SAAG, serum-ascites albumin gradient; TIPS, transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt

sinusoidal pressure appears to be the primary event that leads
to splanchnic (and eventually systemic) vasodilation, which in
turn causes underﬁlling of the vascular compartment and
baroreceptor-mediated stimulation of the renin-angiotensinaldosterone system, the sympathetic nervous system, and
antidiuretic hormone (ADH). The net result is the retention
of renal sodium and water. Nitric oxide appears to be an
important factor in the regulation of intrahepatic vascular
tone. Considerable evidence now shows that, in cirrhosis, the
decreased availability of hepatic vascular nitric oxide impairs
relaxation and increases hepatic perfusion pressure. However,
the splanchnic and systemic vasculature exhibit marked overproduction of endothelial nitric oxide, which results in arterial
vasodilatation and, subsequently, tachycardia, increased cardiac output, and decreased arterial pressure.
The hepatic sinusoids are a very low-pressure hydrostatic
system, compared with other capillary beds (vascular inﬂow is
partly portal venous blood that has a hydrostatic pressure only
slightly higher than systemic venous pressure). In addition,
with albumin freely diffusible across hepatocytes and endothelial membranes, the oncotic pressure gradient within the
sinusoids is very low and unable to counteract any increase
in hydrostatic pressure. Thus, with portal hypertension,
increased pressure in the hepatic sinusoids and splanchnic
vessels causes ﬂuid to move into the tissues and to “weep”
from the surface of the liver as ascites. A minimum hepatic
venous pressure gradient of 10 to 12 mm Hg is necessary for
ascites to develop.
Evaluation of Patients With Ascites

The ﬁrst step in the diagnostic approach to patients with
ascites is to determine the cause (Table 28.1). In 85% of cases,

Table 28.1
Diagnostic and Therapeutic Algorithm for Patients
With Ascites

• Does the patient have cirrhosis?
• If yes, are there any other complications of cirrhosis—
spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, portal vein thrombosis,
active liver disease, malignancy
• Prognostic factors for therapy—urinary sodium excretion,
renal function
• Consideration of therapeutic options

ascites is due to cirrhosis and the diagnosis is usually obvious.
About 15% of cases are due to nonhepatic causes (malignancy,
tuberculosis, constrictive pericarditis, right-sided heart failure, myxedema, and renal causes), and these must be differentiated from cirrhosis and treated appropriately.
Diagnostic paracentesis is mandatory and should be performed in all patients who present with new-onset ascites,
who are hospitalized with cirrhotic ascites, or who have cirrhotic ascites and any deterioration in liver function, with
fever, worsening encephalopathy, or renal failure. Because
bleeding is uncommon, the routine prophylactic use of fresh
frozen plasma or platelets before paracentesis is not recommended. In all cases, ascitic ﬂuid analysis should include a cell
count, both total nucleated and polymorphonuclear neutrophil (PMN) count, and bacterial culture by bedside inoculation of blood culture bottles. Ascitic ﬂuid protein and albumin
levels are measured simultaneously with the serum albumin
level to calculate the serum-ascites albumin gradient (SAAG).
The albumin concentration in ascitic ﬂuid is inversely proportional to portal pressure. In most cases, a SAAG value greater
than 1.1 g/dL conﬁrms, with more than 95% accuracy, the
clinical suspicion of portal hypertensive-related ascites. The
other main cause for a high SAAG value is portal hypertension
related to cardiac failure, but in this case the total protein concentration in the ascites is usually more than 2.5 g/dL (the
value is <2.5 g/dL in cirrhosis-related portal hypertension)
(Table 28.2).

Other tests should be performed only if a speciﬁc diagnosis
is suspected clinically. Lactate dehydrogenase and glucose
levels should be determined if secondary peritonitis is suspected. Other tests to consider are amylase (>1,000 U/L suggests pancreatic ascites), cytology (at least at the initial tap),
and triglycerides (if the ascitic ﬂuid is cloudy; the concentration is <100 mg/dL in cirrhosis). Mycobacterial culture should
be performed only if tuberculosis is strongly suspected. Other
ascitic ﬂuid indices, for example, lactate and pH, generally
have been found to offer little or no additional information.
Gram staining is rarely ever positive.
In addition to spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, other cirrhotic complications that may increase ascites, including
malignancy, portal or hepatic venous thrombosis, or active
liver disease, should be sought by performing liver tests or
imaging studies. Any active liver disease (alcoholic, autoimmune, or hepatitis B) must be treated appropriately. Renal
function and renal sodium excretion should be assessed
because they are clinical predictors of a therapeutic response:
patients with normal blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels
and sodium excretion of more than 10 mEq/L (without taking
diuretics) generally are very sensitive to sodium restriction
and diuretic therapy. Patients with marked sodium retention,
particularly those with abnormal urea and creatinine levels,
require much higher doses of diuretics.
Therapy for Cirrhotic Ascites
Sodium Restriction and Diuretic Therapy

Cirrhotic ascites is perpetuated by renal retention of sodium
and water. Therefore, treatment must produce a negative
sodium balance, sequentially by a low sodium diet and then by
diuretics. Only about 10% of patients with cirrhotic ascites
have a response to salt restriction alone (with or without bed
rest). With the initiation of spironolactone therapy, the ascites
will be controlled in 65% of patients and in another 25% with
the addition of a loop diuretic. Thus, 90% of patients can be
managed, often as outpatients, by the sequential introduction
of sodium restriction, generally to 2 g/day (88 mEq), and then
diuretic therapy. Spironolactone, an aldosterone antagonist, is
an effective diuretic in most patients who have nonazotemic
cirrhosis with ascites and is more effective than furosemide for
single-agent therapy. Combination therapy with furosemide
is used more generally to achieve a more rapid natriuresis and
to maintain normokalemia. Spironolactone is given at an
initial dose of 100 mg/day, with 100 mg/day increments as
appropriate to 400 mg/day, according to the clinical response
and adverse effects, particularly hyperkalemia. Furosemide
usually is started at a dose of 40 mg/day in combination
with spironolactone and increased in 40 mg/day increments to
160 mg/day until the desired effect is achieved or adverse
effects occur. Diuretic therapy is titrated to achieve optimal
weight loss without complications, that is, 1) deterioration in
renal function, 2) excessive weight loss in relation to ascites or
edema, 3) orthostatic symptoms, 4) encephalopathy, or 5)

28 Ascites, Hepatorenal Syndrome, and Encephalopathy

dilutional hyponatremia unresponsive to ﬂuid restriction.
Generally, a weight loss of 0.5 to 1.0 kg/day is optimal to
avoid adverse effects because only 750 to 900 mL/day of ﬂuid
can be mobilized from the abdomen into the general circulation. After the ascites is mobilized by whatever method,
diuretic therapy should be adjusted to keep the patient free of
ascites.
Therapeutic Paracentesis

In randomized studies of patients with tense ascites and avid
sodium retention, repeated large-volume paracentesis (with
intravenous infusions of albumin), compared with diuretic
therapy, is 1) more effective in eliminating ascites; 2) associated with a lower incidence of hyponatremia (5% vs 30%),
renal impairment (3.4% vs 27%), and hepatic encephalopathy
(10.2% vs 29%); and 3) associated with shorter hospital
stay and reduced cost of therapy without any differences
in survival, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, or causes of
death.
Intravenous infusion of 25% albumin is an important measure in patients with cirrhosis and tense ascites who are treated
with repeated large-volume or total paracentesis, and it has
been shown in randomized trials to prevent hyponatremia
and renal impairment. Partial mobilization of ascites, for
example, 5 L (at least in edematous patients), can be removed
safely without the infusion of albumin. However, complete
mobilization of ascites without plasma volume expansion
causes a deterioration in systemic hemodynamics in all
patients, and 20% will develop hyponatremia or renal dysfunction that is frequently irreversible. Generally, 8 g of albumin is infused for every 1 L of ascites removed. Dextran 70 or
polygeline is less effective than albumin as a plasma volume
expander. Terlipressin may be an alternative to albumin, but it
is not available in the United States.
Refractory Ascites
Deﬁnition

Refractory ascites is due to avid renal retention of sodium and
occurs in about 10% of patients with decompensated cirrhosis. Clinically, ascites is considered to be refractory when a
patient has adequate sodium restriction and receives maximal
tolerable doses of diuretics without desired weight loss
(24-hour urine sodium is less than intake). Patients who have
not had a response to 400 mg/day of spironolactone and 160
mg/day of furosemide generally have ascites refractory to
medical therapy.
Reversible factors that contribute to sodium retention
should be identiﬁed and corrected (Table 28.3).
Treatment Options

The long-term prognosis after the development of refractory
ascites is dismal, with a high 1-year mortality rate (>70%).

Reversible Factors for Lack of Response to Diuretic
Therapy in Cirrhotic Ascites

Inadequate sodium restriction
Inappropriate use of diuretics

Portal or hepatic vein thrombosis
Untreated active liver disease

Liver transplantation is the only therapeutic modality capable
of improving both the quality of life and patient survival.
Consequently, liver transplantation should always be considered in an otherwise acceptable candidate with ascites that
cannot be controlled with adequate sodium restriction and
diuretic therapy.
Other therapeutic options for refractory ascites are repeated
therapeutic (large-volume or total) paracentesis or a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS). According to
the treatment recommendations of the American Association
for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD), ﬁrst-line therapy for
refractory ascites is therapeutic paracentesis, and TIPS is
reserved for patients who cannot tolerate paracentesis or who
require large-volume paracentesis for refractory ascites for
more than 2 or 3 months. TIPS is relatively contraindicated
for patients who are older than 70 years, have cardiac dysfunction, or have a Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) score higher
than 11. Peritoneovenous shunting may be considered as a last
resort in patients who are not candidates for repeat largevolume paracentesis, liver transplantation, or TIPS.
TIPS in Refractory Ascites

The hemodynamic effects of TIPS have been well described.
Increased cardiac output and a further decrease in systemic
vascular resistance occurs temporarily for 1 to 3 months, but
increased urinary excretion of sodium starts from 7 to 28 days
after the procedure, together with a decrease in plasma renin
activity and aldosterone levels.
Five randomized trials with 330 patients have shown that
TIPS is effective in reducing ascites in about 50% of patients at
the expense of a 20% higher incidence of encephalopathy.
Overall patient survival is unchanged by TIPS, but in some
patients, liver function deteriorates signiﬁcantly; mortality
increases for patients with a pre-TIPS CTP score higher than
11 or a model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score greater
than 14. Survival after TIPS for refractory ascites is less than
survival after TIPS for variceal bleeding. Predictors of worsening encephalopathy are age older than 65 years, pre-TIPS
encephalopathy, or a TIPS gradient less than 5 mm Hg. The
use of expanded polytetraﬂuoroethylene (ePTFE)-covered
stents is now preferred to bare stents because of less shunt dysfunction and perhaps better survival. However, the optimal
hepatic venous pressure gradient for control of ascites is not
known.

320

Section VI Liver

Hepatic Hydrothorax

This is a complication of cirrhotic ascites in 5% to 10% of
patients. Management is the same as for ascites, with sodium
restriction and diuretic therapy. TIPS is effective in some
patients. Thoracentesis is recommended only if the diagnosis
is uncertain, if infection is strongly suspected, or for symptomatic relief. Chest tubes and pleurodesis should be avoided.

Spontaneous Bacterial Peritonitis

Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis is an infection of ascitic
ﬂuid without a known source of infection. It occurs in 10% to
30% of patients with cirrhotic ascites and is frequently
recurrent (70% recurrence rate in 1 year). In the past, the
infecting organisms were normal bowel ﬂora, with 70% of
cases caused by gram-negative bacilli (especially Escherichia
coli and Klebsiella) and 30% by gram-positive cocci (mainly
Streptococcus and Enterococcus species), with anaerobes being
very uncommon (<5% of cases). Most infections (92% of
cases) are caused by a single organism, and 8% are polymicrobial. The era of norﬂoxacin prophylaxis has caused epidemiologic changes in bacterial ﬂora, with a shift toward more
gram-positive infections. Intestinal bacterial translocation
generally is considered the main pathogenic mechanism leading to spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, by which bacteria
move from the gut to mesenteric lymph nodes and, hence,
into the systemic circulation before infecting the peritoneal
cavity.
The clinical presentation and severity of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis are extremely variable, from chills, fever, and
abdominal pain to no symptoms. The diagnosis may be missed
unless paracentesis is performed. Often, the clinical picture
consists of a single feature, such as fever, abdominal pain,
hypothermia, hypotension, diarrhea, lack of response to
diuretics, deterioration in renal function, or worsening portosystemic encephalopathy (PSE). Patients with cirrhosis who
are at particular risk for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis are
those with more advanced cirrhotic-stage liver disease, a low
concentration of ascitic ﬂuid protein (<1 g/dL), bilirubin level
higher than 3.2 mg/dL, or gastrointestinal tract hemorrhage.
Renal impairment is common in these patients and a clinical
predictor of poor outcome.
Diagnosis

Ascitic ﬂuid analysis is essential for the diagnosis of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (Fig. 28.1). However, the clinical presentation of this condition can be subtle and easily missed
clinically. Diagnostic paracentesis should be performed in all
patients hospitalized with cirrhotic ascites and in patients who
present with signs of infection, encephalopathy, deterioration
of renal function, or gastrointestinal tract bleeding. Bedside
inoculation of blood culture bottles with 10 mL of ascitic ﬂuid
is essential for maximizing the likelihood of positive cultures.

A presumptive diagnosis of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis is made with the ﬁnding of more than 250 PMNs per milliliter of ascitic ﬂuid in a patient with cirrhotic ascites and no
secondary source of infection. Conﬁrmation is by positive
bacterial culture of the ascitic ﬂuid; if the bacterial culture is
negative, the diagnosis of culture-negative neutrocytic ascites
is made if there is no recent history of antibiotic therapy
and no other cause of neutrocytic ascites (cholecystitis, pancreatitis, hemorrhage, recent abdominal surgery, or carcinomatosis). Patients with culture-negative neutrocytic ascites
have clinical and biochemical features identical to those with
microbiologically conﬁrmed spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, and they are assumed to represent cases of spontaneous
bacterial peritonitis missed with current culture techniques.
Bacterascites is deﬁned by ascitic ﬂuid that contains fewer than
250 PMNs per milliliter and a positive bacterial culture. It
is usually the transient residence of bacteria in the ascitic
ﬂuid. Patients with bacterascites generally have less severe
liver disease than those with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.
Although bacterascites may progress to spontaneous bacterial
peritonitis, it usually clears spontaneously without antibiotic
therapy.
Treatment
Antibiotic Therapy

With the ﬁnding of a high PMN count in ascitic ﬂuid, empiric
therapy for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis must be instituted and directed against aerobic enteric bacteria. Cefotaxime,
2 g intravenously every 8 hours, is the ﬁrst choice of antibiotic
for empiric therapy and is started when the PMN count in
ascitic ﬂuid is more than 250 cells/mL. This therapy is more
effective (86%) than the combination of ampicillin-aminoglycoside and is associated with less renal toxicity in patients with
cirrhosis. Aztreonam is less effective because of its lack of
activity against gram-positive organisms; parenteral amoxicillin-clavulanic acid has been found to be clinically effective
in more than 80% of cases. After the organism has been
identiﬁed, antibiotic therapy can be adjusted accordingly.
Uncomplicated spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, in patients
not already receiving quinolones, may be treated effectively in
an outpatient setting with oral oﬂoxacin, a much less expensive alternative. Patients with an ascitic ﬂuid PMN count less
than 250 cells/mL but signs of infection (fever, abdominal
pain, or tenderness) should receive antibiotic therapy while
awaiting culture results.
Epidemiologic changes in bacterial infections have occurred
with norﬂoxacin prophylaxis, and these must be considered
for each patient. A recent study of bacterial infections in
patients with cirrhosis who receive norﬂoxacin prophylaxis
has shown that currently 53% of infections are due to
gram-positive cocci, especially in nosocomial infections,
with invasive procedures, and in patients in intensive care
units. In 50% of patients receiving norﬂoxacin prophylaxis
and in 16% of those not receiving prophylaxis, spontaneous

bacterial peritonitis is caused by quinolone-resistant gramnegative bacilli; these organisms often are resistant also to
trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole therapy.
Albumin Infusions

About 30% of patients with cirrhosis who have spontaneous
bacterial peritonitis develop renal impairment. This is an
important predictor of mortality for these patients. A randomized trial has shown that albumin infusion on day 1 (1.5 g
of albumin per kilogram) and day 3 (1 g/kg) prevented this
complication. AASLD Practice Guidelines state that albumin
infusions should be reserved for very ill patients who are most
at risk, namely, those with a serum creatinine level more than
1 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen more than 30 mg/dL, or total
bilirubin more than 4 mg/dL.

Repeat Paracentesis

Diagnostic paracentesis after 48 hours of antibiotic therapy
in a recovering patient is often considered unnecessary.
However, repeat paracentesis is mandatory for patients who
do not show clinical improvement. If the PMN count is greater
than baseline, the patient must be reexamined carefully for
secondary sites of infection, including repeated abdominal
radiography for free air, computed tomography of the abdomen, and surgical consultation.
Differential Diagnosis

The main differential diagnosis for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis is secondary bacterial peritonitis (5%–10% of cases of
bacterial peritonitis in patients with cirrhosis), most commonly

322

Section VI Liver

from a perforated viscus or occasionally an abscess. Secondary
bacterial peritonitis appears to be a chance occurrence and
may occur in patients with liver disease less severe than spontaneous peritonitis. The operative mortality rate for patients
with cirrhosis who have infected ascites is about 85%, but
is 100% for patients with secondary bacterial peritonitis
without surgery. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and secondary bacterial peritonitis cannot be distinguished on
the basis of clinical features. Factors that suggest a secondary
infection are a high leukocyte count in ascites (>10,000/mL),
multiple or unusual organisms (fungi or anaerobes) in ascitic
ﬂuid culture, ascitic ﬂuid protein less than 1 g/dL, glucose
level less than 50 mg/dL, lactate dehydrogenase level more
than the upper limit of normal for serum, and an increase
in the number of PMNs in ascitic ﬂuid despite antibiotic
therapy.
Primary Prophylaxis

A disadvantage of antibiotic prophylaxis is the emergence of
drug-resistant bacteria, as mentioned above. Episodes of
bleeding in patients with Child’s class C cirrhosis or recurrent
bleeding in patients with cirrhosis are factors that predict
infection and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, which are
often severe. Intravenous cefotaxime or twice daily oral norﬂoxacin should be given for 7 days to all patients with cirrhosis who have an episode of gastrointestinal tract bleeding.
Oral antibiotic prophylaxis is recommended also for patients
with cirrhosis who have very low ascitic ﬂuid protein levels
(<1.5 g/dL), especially if they also have a serum creatinine
level of 1.2 mg/dL or more, blood urea nitrogen 25 mg/dL or
more, serum sodium level 130 mEq/L or less, or CTP score of
9 or higher with a bilirubin level of 3 mg/dL or more.
Secondary Prophylaxis

Because spontaneous bacterial peritonitis has a 1-year recurrence rate of more than 50%, prophylactic measures are warranted for patients who have survived an episode of this
condition. Rarely can the underlying liver disease be treated
(except with liver transplantation), and only occasionally does
diuretic therapy completely clear the ascites. Treatment with
norﬂoxacin, 400 mg/day, can be used to eliminate the gramnegative ﬂora (and reduce gram-negative infection), but it will
not affect the other aerobic and anaerobic ﬂora. Trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole and ciproﬂoxacin also have been effective
for prophylaxis. Daily dosing is preferable to intermittent
dosing.
Bacterascites

When diagnostic paracentesis shows no evidence of neutrocytic ascites (<250 PMNs/mL) but the ascitic ﬂuid culture
grows organisms that are not contaminants, the diagnosis is
bacterascites. Paracentesis should be repeated and a decision

about therapy based on the following: 1) PMNs more than
250/mL, treat as spontaneous bacterial peritonitis; 2) PMNs
fewer than 250/mL but again culture-positive, treat with antibiotics; and 3) PMNs fewer than 250/mL but negative cultures,
no treatment.

Renal Function Abnormalities in Cirrhosis
and Hepatorenal Syndrome

Renal failure is a common complication of cirrhosis (20% of
hospitalized patients with cirrhosis) and an important predictor of mortality. About one-half of all cases is due to volumeresponsive prerenal azotemia, with acute tubular necrosis in
32% of cases and hepatorenal syndrome in 20%. The hemodynamic changes in chronic liver disease increasingly worsen
with the progression from compensated cirrhosis, to ascites,
to hepatorenal syndrome. Mild to severe sodium retention by
the kidneys, mainly due to increased tubular resorption
of sodium, is a key factor in the pathogenesis of ascites formation in cirrhosis. This occurs with activation of the reninangiotensin-aldosterone system and the sympathetic nervous
system and increased secretion of ADH. As liver disease worsens, the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone and
sympathetic systems and the secretion of ADH increases. The
increased secretion of ADH eventually impairs water excretion, resulting in increased total body water and dilutional
hyponatremia. Splanchnic vasodilatation also continues to
increase as liver disease worsens. As ascites progresses to type
2 hepatorenal syndrome, extrasplanchnic vasoconstriction
begins to affect blood ﬂow to the kidneys, brain, liver, and
adrenals, hence the renal vasoconstriction of hepatorenal syndrome. Cardiac output increases in cirrhosis, but eventually as
hemodynamic changes worsen, cardiac output decreases, further worsening the blood ﬂow to extrasplanchnic organs and
potentiating renal impairment.
Hyponatremia

The severity of water retention varies considerably from
patient to patient, but dilutional hyponatremia occurs in
about 30% of hospitalized patients with cirrhotic ascites and is
associated with increased morbidity and mortality. However,
symptoms are rare until sodium levels are very low (<110–115
mEq/L). Treatment is ﬂuid restriction and should be implemented for serum sodium levels less than 125 mEq/L. Rarely
do patients need infusion of hypertonic (3%) saline, and this
is administered only to patients with severe, symptomatic
hyponatremia. The aquaretic drug conivaptan, an antagonist
of arginine vasopressin V1a and V2 receptors, is available in
intravenous form in the United States and is approved for
treating hospitalized patients who have euvolemic or hypervolemic hyponatremia. The utility and safety of oral tolvaptan
have not been deﬁned, and currently, this agent should be
considered only for hospitalized patients.

28 Ascites, Hepatorenal Syndrome, and Encephalopathy

Major Diagnostic Criteria for Hepatorenal
Syndrome

The International Ascites Club (2007) has proposed that the
presence of all the following major criteria is necessary for the
diagnosis of hepatorenal syndrome:
• Cirrhosis with ascites
• Serum creatinine level more than 1.5 mg/dL
• No improvement after 2 days of diuretic withdrawal and
plasma volume expansion with albumin (100 g/day)
• Absence of shock
• No current or recent nephrotoxic drugs or vasodilators
• Absence of parenchymal kidney disease, with proteinuria of less than 500 mg/dL; no ultrasonographic evidence
of obstructive uropathy or microhematuria
In most cases, the diagnosis is made on the basis of the
serum creatinine level, which is a speciﬁc but relatively insensitive index of renal function in this setting. Additional diagnostic criteria, which may help in making the diagnosis but are
not considered essential, are low urine volume (<500 mL/day),
low urine sodium level (<10 mEq/L), urine osmolality greater
than plasma osmolality, few urine erythrocytes (<50 per highpower ﬁeld), and low serum sodium level (<130 mEq/L).
Hepatorenal Syndrome Types 1 and 2

Type 2 hepatorenal syndrome is moderate renal failure that is
stable over a long time; the main consequence is refractory
ascites; the creatinine level is stable at 1.5 to 2.5 mg/dL,
generally with an increase of less than 0.5 mg/dL per day.
In comparison, type 1 hepatorenal syndrome is rapidly progressive renal failure. It usually occurs in patients with type
2 hepatorenal syndrome and results from a precipitating
factor such as infection or gastrointestinal tract bleeding.
The creatinine level is greater than 2.5 mg/dL or creatinine is
more than 1.5 mg/dL, with an increase of 0.5 mg/dL or more
per day.

323

syndrome, norﬂoxacin is recommended for patients with low
protein ascites and CTP score of 9 or higher, bilirubin level 3
mg/dL or more, serum creatinine level 1.2 mg/dL or more, or
serum sodium level 130 mEq/L or less.
Therapy

The only therapy proven effective for hepatorenal syndrome is
liver transplantation. In type 2 hepatorenal syndrome, discontinuation of diuretics and plasma volume expansion are usually effective, at least temporarily. In established hepatorenal
syndrome type 1, patients should undergo plasma volume
expansion with albumin to a normal central venous pressure.
A further ﬂuid challenge may be tried but usually will be ineffective. These patients require an expedited referral for liver
transplantation.
There is increasing evidence for the efﬁcacy of vasoconstrictor therapy in combination with plasma volume expansion with albumin (generally a 100-g initial dose, followed
by 20–40 g/day) for type 1 hepatorenal syndrome. Terlipressin
is the most widely studied drug, is safe, and has been
administered in doses of 0.5 mg/4 hours, up to 12 mg/day, to
more than 154 patients in two randomized controlled trials,
with a response rate of 50% to 60%. Response to terlipressin is
more likely when the bilirubin level is less than 10 mg/dL or
there is an early increase in arterial pressure with therapy.
However, this drug is not available in the United States.
Alpha1 agonists (midodrine or norepinephrine) also have been
used with some beneﬁt with albumin, although there have
been no randomized trials. In a small number of patients,
midodrine and octreotide have successfully reversed the renal
failure.
The condition of a small number of patients with hepatorenal syndrome has improved after TIPS but, in line with
AASLD guidelines, controlled trials are required before this
treatment can be recommended. Renal replacement therapy,
either hemodialysis or continuous venovenous hemoﬁltration,
is used, especially in patients awaiting liver transplantation.

Treatment

Hepatic Encephalopathy
Prevention

Renal dysfunction in cirrhotic ascites is more easily avoided
than treated. All factors that may potentiate renal dysfunction
are avoided, including nephrotoxic drugs (especially nonsteroidal antiinﬂammatory drugs and aminoglycosides),
excessive use of diuretics or lactulose, and large-volume paracentesis without intravenous albumin. Complications such as
bacterial infection, gastrointestinal tract bleeding, dehydration, or hypotension must be treated aggressively. Spontaneous
bacterial peritonitis should be treated with antibiotics and
intravenous albumin. Sepsis is a strong risk factor for renal
failure in cirrhosis and is associated with arterial underﬁlling
and renal vasoconstriction. To reduce the risk of hepatorenal

Hepatic encephalopathy is a debilitating complication of cirrhosis for which therapies are still very limited and nonspeciﬁc. Furthermore, no weight is given for this complication in
the MELD system for organ allocation, resulting in considerable morbidity for patients and a burden for families and the
health care system.
In chronic liver disease, noxious substances, presumed
nitrogenous compounds from protein breakdown, are ineffectively detoxiﬁed or bypassed (or both) by the diseased liver
and affect the brain, causing a neuropsychiatric syndrome
called hepatic encephalopathy. The pathophysiologic mechanism is not well understood, but ammonia is regarded to be of
central importance.

324

Section VI Liver

Clinical Features

Hepatic enceophalopathy is a constellation of neuropsychiatric features (dominated by signiﬁcant psychomotor slowing)
that ﬂuctuate greatly over time and range from a trivial impairment in cognition to frank confusion, drowsiness, and coma.
The four stages of overt hepatic encephalopathy (West
Haven criteria) are well known:
• Grade 1—Confused, altered mood or behavior, psychometric defects
• Grade 2—Drowsy, inappropriate behavior
• Grade 3—Stuporous but with inarticulate speech and
able to obey simple commands, marked confusion
• Grade 4—Coma, unable to be roused
Patients with cirrhosis who have no overt hepatic encephalopathy can now be divided into those with normal cognitive
function and those with minimal hepatic encephalopathy
characterized by changes in psychomotor speed, visual perception, and attention. Studies have now shown that even
minimal hepatic encephalopathy can greatly affect a patient’s
functioning both at home and at work; recent evidence conﬁrms impaired driving skills and an increased crash rate.
No laboratory test can conﬁrm the diagnosis, which rests
on typical neuropsychiatric features in the setting of established chronic liver disease. Neuropsychometric testing is
necessary to diagnose minimal hepatic encephalopathy, but
there is no consensus about the many different tests that assess
different domains of cognitive function. Testing may include
paper-pencil psychomotor tests (eg, number connection
tests), computerized psychomotor tests (eg, inhibitory control
test), and neurophysiologic performance tests (eg, critical
ﬂicker frequency and electroencephalography). The Hepatic
Encephalopathy Scoring Algorithm (HESA) combines clinical
impression with neuropsychologic performance and may
prove more sensitive than the West Haven criteria. Asterixis is
a nonspeciﬁc clinical sign, which generally, but not invariably,
occurs in the early stages of hepatic encephalopathy. Although
associated with an increased arterial level of ammonia, there is
no correlation between the degree of encephalopathy and the
ammonia level.
Management
Identiﬁcation of Precipitants

Hepatic encephalopathy must be differentiated from other
causes of encephalopathy in patients with cirrhosis. Head
imaging excludes structural causes of coma. Also, well-recognized precipitating factors must be sought and treated. To
treat or avoid hepatic encephalopathy in patients who have
advanced cirrhosis, the following general measures must be
considered:
• Avoidance of analgesics, sedatives, and tranquilizers
• Control of gastrointestinal tract bleeding and purging of
blood from the gastrointestinal tract

• Screening and aggressive therapy for any infection
• Correction of acidosis, alkalosis, hypoxia, or electrolyte
abnormalities, especially hyponatremia
• Prevention of constipation and intravascular volume
depletion
• Adequate intake of glucose to treat hypoglycemia and
prevent endogenous protein breakdown
• Adequate vitamin supplementation, including thiamine
and folate
Treatment
Lactulose

This is the mainstay of therapy for most patients for treatment
of an acute episode; it has been shown to reduce recurrence of
hepatic encephalopathy. Lactulose is a nonabsorbable synthetic disaccharide metabolized by colonic bacteria to organic
acids. It decreases the absorption of ammonia by acting as an
osmotic laxative and also by altering colonic pH. The starting
dose is 30 mL two or three times daily, titrated to produce two
to four stools daily. In comatose patients, lactulose is given by
feeding tube or rectally. Excessive therapy can cause dehydration and hypernatremia. Lactitol is equivalent to lactulose but
is not available in the United States. Lactulose is effective in
lactase-deﬁcient patients.
Antibiotics

Rifaximin is a new minimally absorbable antibiotic with
broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. It has shown efﬁcacy
in the treatment of hepatic encephalopathy, and a recent multicenter randomized controlled trial showed that, at doses of
550 mg twice daily (with lactulose in more than 90% of
patients), it reduced the risk of recurrent episodes of hepatic
encephalopathy better than lactulose alone. It is as effective as
and safer than neomycin or metronidazole. Neomycin can be
absorbed to some extent (1%–3%) and lead to ototoxicity and
nephrotoxicity.
Dietary Protein Restriction

Theoretically, increased protein intake increases hepatic
encephalopathy, but fewer than 10% of cases of this condition
are associated with increased protein ingestion, and some
studies have shown improvements in hepatic encephalopathy
in patients with better nutritional status and increased protein
intake. Most patients with hepatic encephalopathy do not
need protein restriction. In advanced coma, protein is withheld for a short time while an adequate level of glucose is
maintained with intravenous infusion; the precipitating cause
for the hepatic encephalopathy can then be identiﬁed and
lactulose therapy initiated. It is critical in the long term, however, to maintain a positive nitrogen balance in these patients,
particularly if they already have muscle wasting. Also, a small
subset of patients appears to be “protein-sensitive,” that is,
they become encephalopathic with moderate amounts of protein. Thus, these patients must be given the least amount of
protein necessary to maintain a positive nitrogen balance.

28 Ascites, Hepatorenal Syndrome, and Encephalopathy

Protein intake of 1.0 to 1.2 g/kg (based on ideal or dry weight)
is essential. Protein is best tolerated if the amount is distributed evenly throughout the day rather than given in large
doses. Also, the composition of the protein may make a difference: vegetable proteins may be more beneﬁcial (less ammoniagenic) than animal proteins. Furthermore, within animal
proteins, toxicity increases from dairy proteins to ﬁsh, to meat,
and ﬁnally, to blood proteins (red meat). Despite no proven
clinical beneﬁt in trials, some patients appear to tolerate preparations of branched chain amino acids better than other proteins. For patients who are transplant candidates, mild hepatic
encephalopathy is tolerated better in the long term than a negative protein balance. For nontransplant candidates with endstage liver disease and refractory hepatic encephalopathy,
quality-of-life issues predominate with regard to diet.
Therapies of Indeterminate Efﬁcacy

Zinc is a cofactor of urea cycle enzymes, and its deﬁciency is
implicated in hepatic encephalopathy. Trials of zinc therapy in
hepatic encephalopathy have been inconclusive. l-Ornithinel-aspartate provides substrate for urea and glutamine synthesis (the two major routes of ammonia clearance), lowers
plasma ammonia, and improves hepatic encephalopathy in
patients with cirrhosis. Benzoate and phenylacetate are used
to correct urea cycle deﬁciencies, and some studies have shown
benzoate to be beneﬁcial in hepatic encephalopathy. Probiotics
have shown some efﬁcacy in hepatic encephalopathy, but their
therapeutic role has not been deﬁned.
Portosystemic Encephalopathy After TIPS

Most post-TIPS hepatic encephalopathy is maximal during
the ﬁrst 3 months and can be controlled by the above measures. About 8% of cases are refractory to medical treatment,
and the options are liver transplantation and occluding the
stent or decreasing its diameter. Stent manipulation is not
without morbidity (recurrent variceal bleeding, ascites, and
even death) and should be considered only for severely refractory cases. Decreasing the diameter of the stent is safer than
occluding it.
Liver Support Devices

The molecular absorbent recirculating system (MARS) has
been used recently to treat patients who have acute decompensation of cirrhosis and hepatic encephalopathy. In a multicenter trial of 70 patients, the treated patients had earlier and
more frequent improvement in hepatic encephalopathy, with
no unexpected adverse events compared to the control
group.
Liver Transplantation

This is the ultimate therapy for hepatic encephalopathy.
Hepatic encephalopathy, which is recurrent or difﬁcult to
treat, is but one manifestation of a deteriorating liver and is an
indication to consider orthotopic liver transplantation.
Because hepatic encephalopathy is not linked directly to mortality in cirrhosis, its presence carries no weight over bilirubin,

325

creatinine, and the international normalized ratio in the
MELD system for organ allocation.
Hepatic Encephalopathy and Spontaneous
Portosystemic Shunts

A new area of investigation in hepatic encephalopathy has
been the identiﬁcation of large portosystemic shunts in
patients with recurrent or persistent hepatic encephalopathy
out of proportion to the severity of liver disease. Fourteen
patients with recurrent or persistent hepatic encephalopathy
were studied and compared with patients with cirrhosis of
equal severity (same bilirubin, international normalized ratio,
albumin, sodium, and creatinine values and MELD score).
As expected, patients with hepatic encephalopathy had
higher ammonia levels but less ascites and varices, and, on
spiral computed tomography, 71% had large portosystemic
shunts, compared with 14% of controls. The conclusion of
the study was that the large shunts clearly decompress the
portal circulation but perpetuate the hepatic encephalopathy.
As yet, there are no proven therapeutic implications of this
ﬁnding.
Prognostic Indicators for Survival
in Cirrhosis

Cirrhosis can be considered in four stages. Stage 1 is completely compensated cirrhosis without varices or ascites. The
1-year mortality rate is very low, and about 11% of patients
annually have progression to a higher stage. Stage 2 is also
compensated; however, varices are present but not ascites; the
mortality rate is a little higher than for stage 1 and 10% of
patients have progression to a higher stage. Stage 3 is deﬁned
by the presence of ascites, with or without varices, and
the mortality rate is 20%, with 7% of patients developing
bleeding varices. Stage 4 is deﬁned by bleeding varices; it has
the highest mortality rate. CTP and MELD scores both predict
mortality.

Metabolic Liver Disease
William Sanchez, MD

Metabolic liver disease refers to inherited disorders of metabolism that manifest prominently with liver disease. The three
major inherited disorders that cause liver disease in adults
include alpha1-antitrypsin deﬁciency, Wilson’s disease, and
hereditary hemochromatosis. All are multisystem disorders
that cause liver injury by various mechanisms but which can
ultimately lead to cirrhosis and complications of liver failure.
Also, various inborn errors of metabolism cause liver disease
that manifests during childhood (Table 29.1). These inborn
errors of metabolism are, in aggregate, a major indication for
pediatric liver transplantation. As an increasing number of
patients with childhood syndromes with liver involvement
survive into adulthood, adult gastroenterologists will need to
become familiar with their care.

Alpha1-Antitrypsin Deﬁciency

Alpha1-antitrypsin deﬁciency is an inherited disorder characterized by the development of liver disease or lung disease (or
both) in children and adults. Clinical manifestations include
cirrhosis and emphysematous obstructive lung disease.

Inheritance and Gene Function

Alpha1-antitrypsin is a member of the serine protease supergene family. The function of alpha1-antitrypsin is to protect
tissues from the proteolytic activity of serum proteases such as
neutrophil elastase. The A1AT gene is located on the long arm
of chromosome 14.
Alpha1-antitrypsin deﬁciency is inherited as an autosomal
codominant disorder. This deﬁciency is characterized on the
basis of phenotype rather than genotype. The normal protein
is labeled “M” and abnormal phenotypes include “S”, “Z”,
and “null.” Phenotypes are reported as the combination of

alleles present; therefore, the “wild type” phenotype is Pi∗MM
(Pi, protease inhibitor) and abnormal phenotypes include
Pi∗MZ, Pi∗SS, and Pi∗ZZ.
For liver disease, the “Z” phenotypes are the most clinically
relevant. The normal Pi∗MM phenotype is present in 95% of
the population and is associated with normal serum levels of
alpha1-antitrypsin. Patients with the Pi∗MZ phenotype have
intermediate deﬁciency, and patients with Pi∗ZZ have severe
deﬁciency. The Z allele has a heterozygote frequency of 1:30
(Pi∗MZ) and a homozygote frequency of 1:2,000 (Pi∗ZZ).

327

328

Section VI Liver

Pathophysiology

It is important to recognize that alpha1-antitrypsin deﬁciency
causes disease by different mechanisms in the lung and liver.
For example, pulmonary disease is caused by unopposed neutrophil elastase and other proteolytic enzymes that produce
tissue damage. In contrast, in the liver, alpha1-antitrypsin is a
“storage” disease. The abnormally folded alpha1-antitrypsin
protein is unable to be exported from hepatocytes into the
circulation. This results in the accumulation of globules of
alpha1-antitrypsin in the endoplasmic reticulum of hepatocytes, resulting in cell injury and death.
Clinical Features

The classic presentation of alpha1-antitrypsin deﬁciency is
premature emphysema (especially in nonsmokers) and liver
disease. This deﬁciency is also an important cause of childhood liver disease, often presenting as a neonatal hepatitis.
The clinical manifestations of this deﬁciency are affected by
the phenotype as well as by environmental factors, such as
tobacco exposure and alcohol use.
In the only population-based study performed, the Swedish
neonatal screening study identiﬁed 127 children deﬁcient for
alpha1-antitrypsin who were followed prospectively through
age 18 years. Neonatal cholestasis developed in 11%, and 6%
had other liver disease without jaundice. Liver test abnormalities developed 1 to 2 months after birth and usually normalized
by 6 months. A small proportion of children developed endstage liver disease or presented with acute liver failure in infancy.
Most (83%) of the children were healthy throughout childhood, although most had liver test abnormalities in early life.
In adolescents and adults, alpha1-antitrypsin deﬁciency
may cause chronic hepatitis or cirrhosis. This deﬁciency should
be considered as a cause of abnormal liver enzyme levels in
patients for which other common causes of liver disease, such
as viral hepatitis, have been excluded. It has been estimated
that 2% of adults between 20 and 50 years old with the Pi∗ZZ
phenotype will develop cirrhosis, compared with 19% of those
older than 50 years. Patients with the Pi∗MZ phenotype are at
some risk for the development of chronic liver disease. It is
likely that the Pi∗MZ phenotype is a cofactor for the development of liver disease, along with other forms of liver injury
such as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Several studies have
noted an increased prevalence of the Pi∗MZ phenotype among
those undergoing orthotopic liver transplantation for cryptogenic cirrhosis compared with those having orthotopic liver
transplantation for other indications. Adults with cirrhosis
due to alpha1-antitrypsin deﬁciency have a greatly increased
risk of hepatocellular carcinoma, with some studies reporting
a prevalence of primary liver cancer of up to 30%.

because they may be falsely increased (in the setting of inﬂammatory conditions, malignancy, pregnancy, or due to estrogen
supplementation) or spuriously decreased (by nephrotic syndrome or protein-losing enteropathy). Also, the serum levels
of alpha1-antitrypsin do not correlate with liver damage,
although they do predict lung damage.
Liver disease due to alpha1-antitrypsin deﬁciency is conﬁrmed by characteristic ﬁndings in liver biopsy samples. Biopsy
is also useful in staging the degree of hepatic ﬁbrosis. The characteristic ﬁnding is the presence of eosinophilic, periodic acidSchiff–positive, diastase-resistant globules in the endoplasmic
reticulum of periportal hepatocytes. Because these globules may
be present also in heterozygotes and in homozygotes without
liver disease, their presence does not imply liver disease.
Furthermore, because the globules may be distributed variably
throughout the liver, their absence does not exclude the diagnosis of alpha1-antitrypsin deﬁciency. The histologic features of the
liver in alpha1-antitrypsin deﬁciency are shown in Figure 29.1.
Patients with cirrhosis due to alpha1-antitrypsin deﬁciency
should be enrolled in a surveillance program for hepatocellular carcinoma (typically with ultrasonography every 6 months).
Patients with diagnosed liver disease due to alpha1-antitrypsin
deﬁciency should be evaluated also for the presence of coexisting lung disease, especially if they are phenotype Pi∗ZZ or are
smokers. Baseline pulmonary function testing and chest radiography are recommended.
Treatment

No effective medical therapy is available for liver disease due to
alpha1-antitrypsin deﬁciency. Although alpha1-antitrypsin infusions are available, their role is limited to patients with alpha1antitrypsin deﬁciency–related lung disease (because infusions of
alpha1-antitrypsin do not improve the accumulation of abnormal alpha1-antitrypsin protein globules within hepatocytes).
The mainstay of therapy is avoidance of alcohol and other hepatotoxins. Furthermore, patients should be advised to refrain
from smoking to decrease the risk of developing emphysema.
Once advanced liver disease develops, liver transplantation
is the only deﬁnitive therapy. Alpha1-antitrypsin deﬁciency is
the most common metabolic indication for liver transplantation. Liver transplantation corrects the consequences of portal
hypertension, and the recipient assumes the Pi phenotype of
the donor. Long-term outcomes for alpha1-antitrypsin deﬁciency after liver transplantation are excellent.
Alpha1-antitrypsin deﬁciency may be amenable to somatic
gene therapy. Gene therapy probably would be beneﬁcial only
for the lung disease unless a method of delivering the corrected gene product to the endoplasmic reticulum of hepatocytes was available. Gene therapy continues to be an area of
research but it is not clinically available.

Diagnosis and Evaluation

Wilson’s Disease

The diagnosis of alpha1-antitrypsin deﬁciency is made by
alpha1-antitrypsin phenotyping or genotyping. Serum levels of
alpha1-antitrypsin are not useful for diagnosing the deﬁciency

Wilson’s disease is an inherited disorder of intrahepatic copper
metabolism characterized by the deposition of excess copper

in the liver, brain, cornea, and other organs. Patients with
this disease may present with acute liver failure, chronic liver
disease, or neuropsychiatric symptoms (or a combination of
these).
Inheritance and Gene Function

Wilson’s disease is a somatic autosomal recessive disorder.
The gene (ATP7B) associated with the disease is on chromosome 13 and codes for a copper-transporting P-type ATPase
located predominantly in the endoplasmic reticulum and biliary canalicular membrane of hepatocytes. Wilson’s disease is
a rare disorder, although it likely is underdiagnosed.
Approximately 1/30,000 persons are homozygous and 1/100
are heterozygous carriers of a Wilson’s disease gene mutation.
To date, more than 100 mutations of ATP7B have been
described. Attempts to correlate genotype with phenotype
have not shown a consistent pattern and are not clinically
useful. Approximately 30% to 40% of North American and
European patients with Wilson’s disease have the H1069Q
mutation.
Unlike hereditary hemochromatosis, in which approximately 90% of cases are homozygous for the C282Y mutation,

the majority of patients with Wilson’s disease are compound
heterozygotes (one copy of two different mutations). The
number of clinically important mutations makes genetic testing less useful for this disease than for hereditary hemochromatosis. Genetic testing is most valuable in screening siblings
of an affected proband in whom the speciﬁc mutations are
known.
Copper Metabolism and Pathophysiology

Copper is an essential trace element that is necessary as a
cofactor for many proteins. Dietary copper is absorbed in the
proximal small bowel. Copper homeostasis is maintained
through the biliary excretion of excess copper by active transport via a metal transporting ATPase. Any disease that impairs
biliary excretion (eg, chronic cholestatic biliary disorders such
as primary biliary cirrhosis or primary sclerosing cholangitis)
can cause increases in the level of hepatic copper. In Wilson’s
disease, intestinal copper absorption is normal but biliary
excretion of copper is decreased, leading to marked copper
overload and ultimately end-organ toxicity.
Copper toxicity has a major role in the pathogenesis of the
disease. Copper accumulates in the liver and eventually

330

Section VI Liver

appears in other organs, particularly the brain and cornea.
Excess copper exerts its toxic effect by the generation of free
radicals that result in lipid peroxidation, similar to the mechanism proposed for iron-induced damage in hereditary hemochromatosis. Deﬁciency of ceruloplasmin is not the cause of
Wilson’s disease; rather, it is an effect of the abnormal cellular
trafﬁcking of copper.
Clinical Features

Wilson’s disease has various clinical manifestations ranging
from asymptomatic patients to those with crippling neurologic symptoms or acute liver failure. Wilson’s disease is a disease of young persons; the typical age at presentation is from
12 to 23 years. Liver manifestations tend to be more common
in childhood, whereas neurologic symptoms tend to appear in
the second and third decades. Although age alone should not
be used to exclude Wilson’s disease, it is extremely rare in
patients older than 40 years.
The ﬁve main categories of clinical presentation are hepatic,
neurologic, psychiatric, hematologic, and ophthalmologic. In
a large clinical series, the initial clinical manifestations were
hepatic in 42% of patients, neurologic in 34%, psychiatric in
10%, and hematologic in 12%.

disabilities until progressive and sometimes irreversible neurologic symptoms begin to develop.
Hematologic Manifestations

Patients may present ﬁrst with a Coombs-negative hemolytic
anemia, frequently seen in association with acute, severe, or
fulminant hepatitis. The constellation of young age, severe
liver dysfunction, and hemolytic anemia should be assumed to
be Wilson’s disease until proved otherwise.
Ocular Manifestations

Occasionally, Wilson’s disease is identiﬁed because of incidental eye ﬁndings or the ocular manifestations may be noted
during the evaluation of patients with suspected Wilson’s disease. Brown Kayser-Fleischer rings represent copper deposition in the periphery of the cornea. These rings are frequently
present in patients with neurologic manifestations of Wilson’s
disease, but the absence of the rings does not exclude the disease. Prominent Kayser-Fleischer rings may be seen on direct
examination, but more subtle rings may require slit-lamp
examination. Sunﬂower cataracts are seen only with a slit lamp
and do not interfere with vision. The ocular manifestations in
Wilson’s disease are shown in Figure 29.2.

Hepatic Manifestations
Other Manifestations

Wilson’s disease can present with any form of liver disease,
including asymptomatic liver test abnormalities, chronic hepatitis, and cirrhosis. Reports of hepatocellular cancer in
Wilson’s disease are rare, even though many patients have
advanced ﬁbrosis at a young age. Although Wilson’s disease
should be considered in all young patients with liver disease, it
is responsible for fewer than 5% of cases of chronic hepatitis in
persons younger than 35 years.
Acute liver failure is a catastrophic manifestation and may
be the initial presentation of patients with Wilson’s disease.
Acute liver failure due to this disease is four times more
common in females than males. Fulminant Wilson’s disease
should be suspected in any young patient with acute liver failure, especially if it is associated with hemolytic anemia. Patients
with fulminant Wilson’s disease require urgent liver transplantation because there is no other effective therapy. (The
diagnosis and management of fulminant Wilson’s disease is a
favorite topic of board examiners.)
Neuropsychiatric Manifestations

The typical neurologic manifestations of Wilson’s disease are
dominated by extrapyramidal motor symptoms, including
rigidity or spasticity, tremor, ataxia, dysarthria, drooling, and
involuntary movements. Dementia and seizures are rare.
Psychiatric problems may be dramatic, with psychosis or
depression, or they may be subtle and manifested as behavioral problems or declining performance in school. Children
often are classiﬁed as having behavioral problems or learning

Wilson’s disease is associated also with proximal or distal renal
tubular acidosis and nephrolithiasis. Another manifestation is
azure lunulae, a blue discoloration of the base of the ﬁngernails that is an uncommon but characteristic ﬁnding.
Diagnosis and Evaluation

The diagnosis of Wilson’s disease requires a strong clinical
suspicion because of the multitude of potential manifestations. The disease should be considered in any person younger
than 30 years who has liver disease. The combination of liver
disease and extrapyramidal motor abnormalities should
strongly suggest Wilson’s disease. The combination of severe
liver disease and hemolytic anemia should be considered
Wilson’s disease until deﬁnitively proven otherwise.
Liver chemistry values are frequently abnormal in patients
with Wilson’s disease and characteristic patterns may serve as
a clinical clue, but they are not consistent enough to be conﬁrmatory. The alkaline phosphatase level is often low, and the
serum aminotransferase levels tend to be increased less than
would be expected from other signs of liver necrosis. Uric acid
levels are usually low or undetectable, often because of concomitant proximal renal tubular acidosis. Serum copper levels
are of limited usefulness because they may be low, normal,
or increased and normal serum copper levels do not exclude
Wilson’s disease.
The initial evaluation for suspected Wilson’s disease should
include 1) determination of the serum ceruloplasmin level, 2)

29 Metabolic Liver Disease

Kayser-Fleischer rings or neurologic symptoms. Liver morphologic features are nonspeciﬁc in Wilson’s disease. Often,
steatosis is present, and glycogenated nuclei are common. The
“gold standard” for conﬁrming the diagnosis of the disease is
quantitative tissue copper analysis. A normal liver concentration of copper (<35 μg/g dry weight) excludes the diagnosis.
Most patients with the disease have liver copper concentrations greater than 250 μg/g dry weight, but this is not a speciﬁc
ﬁnding and may occur in chronic cholestatic conditions or,
rarely, in autoimmune hepatitis. Unlike hereditary hemochromatosis, children with Wilson’s disease may already have
marked liver ﬁbrosis; thus, liver biopsy should be strongly
considered in children to stage the liver disease.

B

Treatment

Treatment is life-long. Because many patients with Wilson’s
disease are adolescents or young adults, adherence to therapy
can be a problem, especially among asymptomatic patients.
Therapies for Wilson’s disease can be divided broadly into two
categories: chelating agents that remove copper from the body
and agents that inhibit intestinal absorption of dietary copper.
Liver transplantation also is indicated as a treatment for fulminant Wilson’s disease (acute liver failure often associated
with hemolysis) or for patients with complications of cirrhosis
from the disease.

a 24-hour urine collection for copper quantiﬁcation, and 3) a
slit-lamp examination for Kayser-Fleischer rings. The serum
level of ceruloplasmin is less than 20 mg/dL in 95% of patients
with Wilson’s disease. Even though the level of ceruloplasmin
can be increased nonspeciﬁcally as an acute phase reactant or
as a result of estrogen administration, a level higher than 30
mg/dL essentially excludes the diagnosis of Wilson’s disease
except in rare patients who present with fulminant hepatitis.
Low ceruloplasmin levels must be interpreted with caution
because any chronic liver disease with synthetic dysfunction
or protein-losing states may be associated with a ceruloplasmin level that is lower than normal. Urinary copper excretion
can be increased in other liver diseases; however, a value less
than 100 μg/24 hours in a patient with clinical disease would
be very unusual in symptomatic Wilson’s disease. A low rate of
urinary copper excretion may indicate acquired copper deﬁciency. This may be confusing because cases of severe copper
deﬁciency may be associated with neurologic symptoms.
The neurologic syndrome in these cases is myelopathy with
weakness and ataxia.
In most cases, liver biopsy is necessary to conﬁrm the
diagnosis of Wilson’s disease, particularly in the absence of

Patients with symptomatic or clinically evident disease should
be treated initially with chelating agents. Penicillamine and
trientine are metal chelators that induce the urinary excretion
of copper. Both agents have been approved for the treatment
of Wilson’s disease. Penicillamine is effective therapy and
historically has been considered as ﬁrst-line treatment, but it
has numerous adverse effects. Up to 20% of patients experience drug toxicity, including hypersensitivity reactions, bone
marrow suppression, proteinuria, autoimmune disorders,
and dermatologic conditions. Importantly, as many as 20%
of patients with neurologic symptoms may experience worsening of their symptoms during the ﬁrst month of treatment.
This deterioration has been irreversible in some patients.
Therefore, trientine should be considered as initial therapy
for patients with neurologic symptoms from Wilson’s
disease.
Trientine was introduced as an alternative to penicillamine.
However, because of a lower incidence of adverse effects, trientine should be the ﬁrst choice for treatment. It is given in
doses similar to those for penicillamine and also has satisfactory long-term efﬁcacy. The cupruresis is less pronounced
than with penicillamine, but an initial increase is expected.
Occasionally, iron deﬁciency may develop because of sideroblastic anemia. Tetrathiomolybdate has shown promise as an
effective therapy; however, regulatory approval is still pending
in the United States and Canada. Dosing and monitoring of
agents for Wilson’s disease are outlined in Table 29.2.

Treatment response to chelator therapy is demonstrated by
an acute increase in urinary copper excretion that gradually
plateaus at a lower level over 6 to 12 months. Initially, urinary
copper output is often more than 2,000 μg daily, decreasing to
400 to 500 μg daily in the maintenance phase. The urine and
serum levels of copper and the ceruloplasmin level should be
measured and a complete blood count should be performed
weekly during the ﬁrst month, then every 1 or 2 months during
the ﬁrst 6 months. Patients whose condition is stable can then
be followed annually. The slit-lamp examination should be
repeated annually to document the disappearance of KayserFleischer rings (if present).
Inhibition of Copper Absorption

Zinc acetate induces the synthesis of metallothionein in
the intestinal epithelium, which then preferentially binds
copper and prevents its absorption. Zinc therapy is indicated

for presymptomatic patients and pregnant women. It also may
be used for maintenance therapy for patients presenting with
symptomatic disease following initial chelation therapy to
remove excess copper (typically after 6–12 months). Treatment
is monitored by checking urinary levels of zinc and copper.
The urinary excretion of zinc should be at least 2,000 μg/day.
For pregnant women with Wilson’s disease, penicillamine
is likely safe, but zinc is a better choice for patients whose condition is stable. The teratogenicity of trientine is unknown,
and it should not be given during pregnancy.
Liver Transplantation

The indications for liver transplantation include acute liver
failure, end-stage liver disease unresponsive to medical therapy,
and chronic deterioration of liver function despite long-term
therapy. Medical therapy is not effective in reversing fulminant
Wilson’s disease, and patients with fulminant disease require
urgent liver transplantation and are given high priority for
donor organ allocation (UNOS status 1). Outcomes for liver
transplantation in patients with fulminant disease are good,
with a 1-year survival rate of 73%. Among those with chronic
liver failure, the 1-year survival rate is about 90%. There are
anecdotal reports of marked neurologic improvement after
liver transplantation, but transplantation performed solely for
refractory neurologic symptoms is considered experimental
because of the limited experience and uncertain outcome.
Family Screening

After Wilson’s disease has been diagnosed, family members
should have screening tests for the disease. Testing should be
directed at siblings because each has about a 25% chance of
having the disease. If treatment is begun in the presymptomatic phase of the disease before cirrhosis is established, disease
progression can be prevented. Because copper metabolism in
infancy and early childhood may simulate Wilson’s disease,
children should not be tested before age 5 years. Screening
should include aminotransferase and ceruloplasmin levels and
a slit-lamp examination for Kayser-Fleischer rings. If the
results are normal, screening should be repeated every 5 years
until age 20. If the ceruloplasmin level is less than 20 mg/dL
but there are no Kayser-Fleischer rings or convincing neurologic symptoms, liver biopsy may be necessary. Genetic testing
generally is used for screening once the pattern in the index
case is known. This may be of value if standard copper test
results are equivocal.

Hereditary Hemochromatosis

Hereditary hemochromatosis is an inherited disorder of iron
metabolism characterized by the deposition of excess iron in
the liver, heart, joints, pancreas, skin, testes, and other organs.
Patients with hereditary hemochromatosis may present with
chronic liver disease, cardiomyopathy, or arthropathy.

29 Metabolic Liver Disease

Inheritance and Gene Function

Hereditary hemochromatosis is a somatic autosomal recessive
disorder. The gene associated with this disorder is the HFE
gene, on the short arm of chromosome 6. In contrast to the
large number of mutations of the ATP7B gene for Wilson’s
disease, the HFE gene has two common point mutations,
C282Y and H63D. Other mutations have been described, but
they probably are not of major clinical importance. About
85% of patients with iron overload consistent with hereditary
hemochromatosis are homozygotes for the C282Y mutation.
The HFE gene is involved in regulating dietary iron absorption. The HFE protein binds to the transferrin receptor and
functions to signal when body iron stores are adequate. Mutant
HFE fails to downregulate iron absorption from enterocytes
despite adequate iron levels, leading to iron overload.
Unlike Wilson’s disease, hereditary hemochromatosis is
not a rare disorder. It is the most common single-gene, inherited disorder in the US white population. Approximately 1 in
every 200 to 300 white persons in the United States is homozygous for the hemochromatosis mutation, and at least 1 in
every 10 is a heterozygous carrier.

333

age, dietary iron intake, and unknown factors, including
mutations in genes other than HFE. Liver disease is also
affected by alcohol consumption and comorbid liver disease
(eg, hepatitis C), which accelerate hepatic ﬁbrosis.
In the past, hereditary hemochromatosis usually was
diagnosed at an advanced stage. The classic description of
hereditary hemochromatosis “bronze diabetes” resulted from
cutaneous hyperpigmentation, diabetes mellitus, and cirrhosis. Currently, the disease is diagnosed in most patients at an
asymptomatic stage through laboratory studies. Clinical manifestations of the disease include fatigue, hepatomegaly, abnormal liver enzyme levels, cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma,
cardiomyopathy, cardiac conduction disorders, hypothyroidism, hypogonadism, erectile dysfunction, and arthropathy.
An example of hemochromatosis arthropathy is shown in
Figure 29.3. Most, if not all, clinical manifestations are preventable if the disease is diagnosed early and treated appropriately.

Iron Metabolism and Pathophysiology

Iron metabolism is relatively complex. The pathophysiology
of hereditary hemochromatosis can be summarized as the failure to downregulate dietary iron absorption in the setting of
adequate or excess body iron stores. However, not all iron
overload is due to hereditary hemochromatosis; excess iron
administration, multiple blood transfusions, or hematopoietic
disorders can result in secondary iron overload states.
Dietary iron absorbed by enterocytes is transported through
the basolateral membrane into the bloodstream by the transmembrane transporter ferroportin. HFE, and transferrin
receptor 1, is involved in signaling adequate iron stores. This,
in turn, leads to increased expression of the hepcidin protein,
which inhibits iron release from ferroportin into the bloodstream. In the presence of mutant HFE, ferroportin is not
upregulated, leading enterocytes to detect a state of iron deﬁciency and continue to avidly transport dietary iron into the
bloodstream. This uninhibited iron absorption leads to iron
excess and eventually end-organ toxicity.
Clinical Features

Because persons with hereditary hemochromatosis absorb
only a few more milligrams of iron each day than needed,
clinical manifestations generally occur after the ﬁfth decade,
when 15 to 40 g of iron have accumulated (normal body iron
stores are approximately 4 g). Among C282Y homozygotes,
approximately 30% of males and 2% to 10% of females have
evidence of biochemical or clinical iron overload. The lower
frequency of clinical iron overload among women than men is
likely due to menstrual and pregnancy-related blood loss.
Additional factors that inﬂuence disease expression include

Figure 29.3 Hemochromatosis arthropathy. A radiograph of the hand

shows cartilage loss, marginal sclerosis, and osteophyte formation in
the second and third metacarpophalangeal joints (arrows) without
involvement of the fourth and ﬁfth joints. Involvement of the second
and third metacarpophalangeal joints is characteristic of
hemochromatosis arthropathy. Occasionally, calcium pyrophosphate
dihydrate crystals may be present (chondrocalcinosis). (Adapted from

Section VI Liver

Hepatomegaly, abnormal liver test results, skin bronzing, cardiomyopathy, and cardiac conduction disorders may reverse
after iron depletion, although most other clinical manifestations are not reversible.
The development of hepatocellular carcinoma is a major
consequence of hereditary hemochromatosis. Up to one-third
of patients with hereditary hemochromatosis and cirrhosis
develop hepatocellular carcinoma, which often is the cause of
death. The presence of hemochromatosis imparts a 200-fold
increased risk for the development of liver cancer, with most
cases involving patients with cirrhosis. The increased risk of
hepatocellular carcinoma does not improve after iron depletion. Patients with hereditary hemochromatosis-related cirrhosis should have abdominal ultrasonography every 6 months
to screen for hepatocellular carcinoma.
Diagnosis and Evaluation

Hereditary hemochromatosis is diagnosed on the basis of a
combination of clinical, laboratory, and pathology criteria.

Fasting, morning transferrin
saturation >45%

Iron studies should show increased serum transferrin saturation (100 × [serum iron concentration/total iron binding
capacity]) and increased serum ferritin level. The serum iron
values show diurnal variation, and measurements may be
affected by the ingestion of food. For this reason, serum iron
levels should be measured early in the morning with the
patient fasting. An increase in transferrin saturation is the earliest laboratory abnormality in hereditary hemochromatosis.
The serum concentration of ferritin is usually a reasonable
estimate of total body iron stores. However, because ferritin
is also an acute phase reactant, it is increased in various
infectious and inﬂammatory conditions without any iron
overload. This is a common pitfall in the diagnosis of
hereditary hemochromatosis. Ferritin may be increased
in 30% to 50% of patients who have viral hepatitis, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, or alcoholic liver disease. For
these reasons, ferritin should not be used as the initial screening test to detect hereditary hemochromatosis. A diagnostic
algorithm for hereditary hemochromatosis is provided in
Figure 29.4.

29 Metabolic Liver Disease

HFE Gene Testing

The HFE gene test is most useful for surveillance of adult ﬁrstdegree relatives of an identiﬁed proband. HFE gene testing has
replaced the HLA typing previously used to screen for hereditary hemochromatosis in relatives of affected persons. HFE
gene testing is also often useful in cases of diagnostic uncertainty, such as iron overload associated with hepatitis C, alcoholic liver disease, or other causes of end-stage liver disease.
Before the HFE gene test is performed, the person should be
counseled about the risks, beneﬁts, and alternatives of genetic
testing, including the possibility of insurance or employment
discrimination. Thus, HFE gene testing usually is not recommended for anyone younger than 18 years.
The two most common HFE mutations are C282Y and
H63D. Together, they account for approximately 85% of cases
of hereditary hemochromatosis. C282Y homozygotes are the
most likely to present with clinically evident iron overload.
Compound heterozygotes (C282Y/H63D) and H63D homozygotes have signiﬁcantly lower rates of clinically evident iron
overload (approximately 20%). Heterozygotes (single copy of
C282Y or H63D) typically do not develop iron overload; however, some have been observed to have slightly high (or highnormal) values on serum iron tests.
Liver Biopsy

Liver biopsy had an important role in the diagnosis of hereditary hemochromatosis before the HFE gene test was available.
Currently however, the role of liver biopsy is limited to cases
with diagnostic uncertainty and to assess for the presence of
advanced ﬁbrosis or cirrhosis. In patients with iron overload
who are C282Y homozygotes, liver biopsy is not necessary to
conﬁrm the diagnosis. Qualitative assessments of hepatic iron
may be assessed with an iron stain (eg, Perls’ Prussian blue). In
hereditary hemochromatosis, iron accumulates initially in
periportal hepatocytes and eventually is distributed throughout the liver. This is in contrast to secondary iron overload in
which iron often occurs predominantly in Kupffer cells. In
severe iron overload, this distinction cannot be made reliably.
The histologic features of the liver in hereditary hemochromatosis and secondary iron overload are shown in Figure 29.5.
The “gold standard’ for diagnosis of hereditary hemochromatosis is the quantitative measurement of iron stores in the
liver. Liver iron stores increase progressively with age, and this
has led to the development of the hepatic iron index, that is,
the hepatic iron concentration in micromoles/gram dry
weight liver divided by the patient’s age in years. A hepatic
iron index more than 1.9 is strongly suggestive of hereditary
hemochromatosis.
Identifying patients who have hereditary hemochromatosis-related cirrhosis is critical because of the need to screen for
complications of cirrhosis, including esophageal varices and
increased risk of hepatocellular cancer. Patients with hereditary hemochromatosis whose risk of having cirrhosis is minimal can be predicted by age and ferritin levels. In C282Y

335

homozygotes younger than 40 years who have serum ferritin
levels less than 1,000 μg/L and normal aspartate aminotransferase values, cirrhosis is unlikely and liver biopsy would be
unnecessary. Consequently, liver biopsy is advisable for
patients older than 40 years who have abnormal levels of
aminotransferases or a ferritin concentration greater than
1,000 μg/L (or both) to deﬁnitively assess for the presence of
cirrhosis.
Secondary Iron Overload

Not all iron overload is due to hereditary hemochromatosis,
which should be distinguished from iron overload caused by
other conditions. Secondary iron overload should be suspected in patients with chronic anemias who have ineffective
erythropoiesis or have had multiple blood transfusions. In
rare instances, prolonged iron supplementation can produce
abnormal iron test results and, even more rarely, tissue iron
overload.
A commonly encountered cause of abnormal iron test
results is acute or chronic liver disease. Acute liver disease may
be accompanied by a high ferritin level, usually with a normal
transferrin saturation. Chronic liver disease, particularly if
advanced, may result in abnormalities in ferritin and iron saturation that can mimic hereditary hemochromatosis. However,
severe iron overload from hereditary hemochromatosis may
be indistinguishable from that due to secondary causes.
Patients with alcohol-related steatohepatitis may present with
markedly increased ferritin levels. If the diagnosis is in doubt,
these patients can be observed because alcohol-related increases
in ferritin will decrease remarkably over a short period
(3 months) with abstinence from alcohol. Patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease often present with increased liver
enzyme and ferritin levels. This is clinically relevant because it
is a frequent cause for referral and confusion. Despite hereditary hemochromatosis being a common disease, most patients
with abnormal iron tests do not have the disease.
Treatment

Hemochromatosis is a simple and satisfying disease to treat,
and treatment before the development of end-organ damage
can prevent serious morbidity and death. Treatment is through
iron depletion via therapeutic phlebotomy. Therapeutic phlebotomy is the preferred treatment because it is simple, relatively inexpensive, and effective. Dietary modiﬁcations are not
advised because iron depletion cannot be achieved with dietary
changes alone. Patients should be counseled to refrain from
taking iron supplements, including multivitamins with
iron, and high-dose vitamin C supplements. Although iron
chelators such as the parenteral agent deferoxamine and oral
agent deferasirox are often administered to patients with secondary iron overload (particularly those with hematologic
disorders who may not tolerate phlebotomy), they are associated with more adverse effects and are much less effective than
phlebotomy.

pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; 2000. pp. 187–99. Used with permission.)

Usually, the treatment of hereditary hemochromatosis is
reserved for patients who have evidence of iron overload as
indicated by an increase in the serum concentration of ferritin. Patients with HFE gene mutations without iron overload
do not need phlebotomy (but should be monitored periodically). Therapeutic phlebotomy is divided into two phases: 1)
during the initial phase, phlebotomy is performed frequently
to deplete excess iron stores and 2) this is followed by life-long
maintenance phlebotomy to prevent the reaccumulation of
excess iron.
The initial phase of phlebotomy begins with removal of
500 mL of blood weekly. The hemoglobin concentration
should be measured just before each phlebotomy. Weekly
phlebotomy should continue as long as the hemoglobin concentration is higher than a preselected value (usually 12–13
g/dL). If the concentration is less than the preselected value,
phlebotomy should not be performed. Once the hemoglobin

concentration remains below the preselected value for 3 consecutive weeks without phlebotomy, the serum concentration
of ferritin and transferrin saturation should be determined
again. Iron depletion is conﬁrmed if the ferritin level is not
more than 50 μg/L, with a transferrin saturation in the lownormal range. When iron depletion has been achieved, most
patients require maintenance phlebotomies about every 3 to 4
months to keep the ferritin level lower than 50 μg/L. Once
depleted, patients should have iron stores checked every 1 to 2
years to adjust the frequency of maintenance phlebotomy as
necessary.
Despite being common, hereditary hemochromatosis only
rarely causes complications of cirrhosis and is an uncommon
indication for orthotopic liver transplantation, accounting for
fewer than 1% of all liver transplants performed in the United
States. Patients with hepatocellular carcinoma complicating
hereditary hemochromatosis-related cirrhosis should be

referred for consideration of liver transplantation (the tumors
must meet liver transplantation criteria). The survival rate of
patients with hereditary hemochromatosis undergoing liver
transplantation has improved in recent years and is now
similar to that of liver transplantation for other indications.
The death of many liver transplant recipients who have hereditary hemochromatosis is caused by cardiac or infectious
complications.
Family Screening

Currently, experts disagree about the usefulness of screening
for hereditary hemochromatosis in the general population.
Despite the disease fulﬁlling many of the criteria of a condition appropriate for population screening, some public health
experts do not advocate screening. Screening for the disease
in family members of affected individuals is crucial because
25% of siblings and 5% of children of a proband will have the
disease. HFE gene testing should be considered also for siblings of C282Y heterozygotes. The spouse of an affected person
may be tested to assess the risk to children. If the spouse does
not have a mutation for HFE, the children will not be
affected.

Cholestatic Liver Disease
Keith D. Lindor, MD

Cholestatic liver disease in adults without biliary obstruction
encompasses a broad differential diagnosis. Drug-induced
cholestasis may be the most common explanation for cholestasis in these patients. Primary biliary cirrhosis is the
most common cholestatic liver disease in adults. Primary sclerosing cholangitis is about half as common as primary biliary
cirrhosis. Other cholestatic conditions in adults include
antimitochondrial antibody (AMA)-negative primary biliary
cirrhosis, human immunodeﬁciency virus (HIV)-related
cholangiopathy, and miscellaneous conditions.

Differential Diagnosisa

The differential diagnosis for cholestasis in adults without biliary obstruction is listed in the Table 30.1.

virus.

Primary Biliary Cirrhosis

Primary biliary cirrhosis has a prevalence of about 150 to
300 per million persons, involves women in 90% of cases, and
is characterized by a positive AMA test in 95% of patients.
These patients present with biochemical features of cholestasis
and may be symptomatic. Fatigue is the most common symptom, but it is nonspeciﬁc and not useful in establishing the
diagnosis. Pruritus is less common but may occur in 30% to
50% of patients. Increasingly, primary biliary cirrhosis is being
recognized in asymptomatic patients on the basis of abnormal
liver test results. The alkaline phosphatase level is prominently
increased, but serum levels of cholesterol and IgM also can be
abnormally high. The most characteristic ﬁnding is a positive
AMA test, which recognizes the lipoic acid binding site on an
Abbreviations: AMA, antimitochondrial antibody; ERCP, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography; HIV, human immunodeﬁciency virus

enzyme in the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. The diagnosis often is established by the ﬁnding of high-titer AMA in the
appropriate clinical setting. Although liver biopsy helps conﬁrm the diagnosis and provides information about histologic
staging, it may not be required in most cases. Cross-sectional
imaging studies such as ultrasonography, computed tomography, or magnetic resonance imaging can help exclude biliary
obstruction. Direct cholangiography is not needed to establish
this diagnosis.
AMA-Negative Primary Biliary Cirrhosis

AMA-negative primary biliary cirrhosis is characterized by
clinical and histologic features identical to those of primary
biliary cirrhosis. However, the patients do not have a positive
AMA test, but 95% have either antinuclear or anti-smooth
muscle antibodies. Occasionally, these patients are confused
with those who have overlapping autoimmune hepatitis and

339

340

Section VI Liver

primary biliary cirrhosis, but the histologic features and biochemical proﬁle generally help differentiate AMA-negative
primary biliary cirrhosis from the overlap between primary
biliary cirrhosis and autoimmune hepatitis.
Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis

Primary sclerosing cholangitis is the next most common
cholestatic condition in adults. About 70% of patients have
inﬂammatory bowel disease, and, unlike primary biliary cirrhosis, primary sclerosing cholangitis is more common in men
than in women. The age at onset tends to be younger, around
40 years for primary sclerosing cholangitis compared with
50 years for primary biliary cirrhosis. Positive AMA tests rarely
are present (≥2% of patients). Liver biopsy can help conﬁrm
the diagnosis. Biopsy specimens may show more ﬁbrosis
surrounding the bile ducts and less inﬂammation than seen
in primary biliary cirrhosis, although these characteristic
ﬁndings generally are not apparent. Unlike primary biliary
cirrhosis, direct cholangiography is necessary to establish the
diagnosis of primary sclerosing cholangitis. Occasionally,
patients have normal cholangiographic ﬁndings, but the
histologic and clinical features (history of inﬂammatory
bowel disease) suggest primary sclerosing cholangitis. These
patients are considered to have small duct primary sclerosing
cholangitis.
HIV-Related Cholangiopathy

HIV-related cholangiopathy is deﬁned as biliary obstruction
due to infections that lead to biliary strictures. This was more
common in HIV-infected patients before highly active antiretroviral therapy was introduced. The frequency has now
decreased. The usual organisms include Cryptosporidium
parvum, microsporida, cytomegalovirus, and Cyclospora. The
infection due to these organisms typically involves the intrahepatic biliary system.
The condition usually occurs in patients with very low CD4
counts and may manifest with right upper quadrant pain and
diarrhea; fever and jaundice are less common. Alkaline phosphatase levels usually are increased. Transaminase levels usually are elevated mildly, and jaundice is unusual and generally
mild. Diagnosis is often made with endoscopic retrograde
cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), with ultrasonography as
the initial study. The cholangiographic patterns seen in more
than one-half of the patients are those of papillary stenosis and
sclerosing cholangitis. Patterns of intrahepatic and extrahepatic involvement without papillary stenosis, papillary stenosis alone, or intrahepatic involvement alone are less common.
Often, treatment against the causative agent is ineffective.
Treatment with highly active anti-retroviral therapy decreases
the percentage of patients with HIV infection that progresses
to acquired immunodeﬁciency syndrome and may eventually
prevent the development of biliary complications. If patients
have obstruction, endoscopic therapy with dilation should be
considered.

Treatment of Speciﬁc Conditions
Primary Biliary Cirrhosis

Currently, we prescribe ursodiol at a dose of 13 to 15 mg/kg
daily, in divided doses, for patients with any stage of primary
biliary cirrhosis who have abnormal ﬁndings on liver tests.
Patients who meet minimal listing criteria for liver transplantation should be referred for evaluation, but there is no harm
in initiating ursodiol therapy while awaiting a donor organ.
Ursodiol therapy should be increased gradually over 2 to
3 weeks to avoid precipitating pruritus, which can occur if the
full dose is given initially. Ursodiol improves survival free of
transplantation, decreases the risk of the development of cirrhosis and varices, and lowers lipid levels. Prognostic models
valid in the absence of therapy remain valid when scores are
recalculated after 6 months of therapy and can provide useful
information. However, not all patients have a response to
ursodiol therapy. Approximately 35% of patients have complete biochemical normalization, with an excellent clinical
response. During therapy, alkaline phosphatase values usually
are used to deﬁne the response. Once ursodiol therapy is
begun, it appears to be a lifelong need, and patients should be
instructed accordingly. Adverse effects are minimal.
AMA-Negative Primary Biliary Cirrhosis

Patients with AMA-negative primary biliary cirrhosis typically
have a response to ursodiol therapy, showing the usual
response of patients with primary biliary cirrhosis. Occasionally,
these patients have a response to corticosteroids or the combination of ursodiol and corticosteroids. This is particularly
likely in patients with overlap of primary biliary cirrhosis and
autoimmune hepatitis. Most clinicians would begin treatment
with ursodiol alone and add corticosteroids if the results of
liver biochemistry tests did not improve after 3 to 6 months.
Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis

Primary sclerosing cholangitis is the most troublesome of the
more common adult cholestatic liver diseases because no
effective therapy is available. For treatment of primary sclerosing cholangitis, ursodiol in standard doses of 13 to 15 mg/kg
daily and in high doses of 28 to 30 mg/kg has not been shown
to be effective. Patients may have evidence of rapidly progressive jaundice, may suddenly develop pruritus, or may have
fever with right upper quadrant pain. When any of these
occur, cholangiography (usually ERCP) should be considered,
although magnetic resonance cholangiography is also an alternative (Figure 30.1). Cholangiocarcinoma, choledocholithiasis, or a dominant stricture all can be responsible for these
manifestations and can be differentiated best with ERCP. The
endoscopic approach allows biopsy with brushing for suspected malignancy, extrication of biliary stones, or dilatation
of dominant strictures. The role of stenting after dilatation has
not been deﬁned clearly.

prescribing antihyperlipidemic therapy for these patients
because some of the agents may be hepatotoxic; instead, they
have usually settled for the antihypercholesterolemic effects of
ursodiol when given for primary biliary cirrhosis.
Pruritus

B

Pruritus can be one of the most troublesome symptoms of
patients with cholestasis. The severity of the pruritus does not
correlate closely with the severity of the underlying liver disease, and pruritus may resolve as the disease progresses.
Ursodiol reduces pruritus in some patients with primary biliary cirrhosis, but for those who remain symptomatic, antihistamines (ie, diphenhydramine 25–30 mg by mouth at bedtime)
may relieve the pruritus and permit sleep. Cholestyramine
(4-g packets 3 or 4 times daily) may help relieve itching, but it
can be unpleasant to use. Rifampin (150–300 mg twice daily)
has a rapid onset of action and may be useful long term,
although liver toxicity may develop in 15% of patients.
Naltrexone (50 mg daily) may be useful for some patients,
although there is less experience with this drug than with the
others. Liver transplantation is available for patients who have
severe, intolerable pruritus.

Management of Complications
of Cholestasis

Malabsorption and deﬁciency of fat-soluble vitamins may
occur, especially if cholestasis is severe. Levels of vitamins A,
E, and D can be measured in serum directly, and the level of
vitamin K can be inferred from the prothrombin time.
Replacement with water-soluble forms of the vitamins can be
offered (vitamin A, 50,000 units twice weekly; vitamin E,
200 units twice daily; vitamin D, 50,000 units twice weekly;
and vitamin K, 5 mg daily). Adequacy of replacement can
be reassessed by measuring levels after 6 to 12 months of
therapy. Hypercholesterolemia, common in patients with
cholestasis, does not appear to be associated frequently
with atherosclerosis. Hepatologists have not been aggressive in

Although the insufﬁcient delivery of bile acids to the gut lumen
in advanced cholestasis may lead to fat-soluble vitamin deﬁciency, osteomalacia due to vitamin D deﬁciency occurs in
fewer than 5% of patients with osteopenic bone disease and
cholestasis. Almost all bone disease evaluated in North
America in this setting is due to osteoporosis, which is the
result of insufﬁcient bone matrix rather than a mineralization
defect as found in osteomalacia. The cause of the osteoporosis
is uncertain. The patients lose bone at a rate about twice that
of the normal population. About 33% of patients with primary biliary cirrhosis and about 20% of those with primary
sclerosing cholangitis are osteopenic at the time of diagnosis,
and about 10% of them experience vertebral fractures within a
few years after diagnosis. The management of the bone disease
includes exercise and adequate calcium intake with 1.5 g of
elemental calcium daily in combination with vitamin D supplementation, if deﬁcient. Postmenopausal women may have
a response to hormone replacement therapy, usually given as
patch therapy. Calcitonin therapy does not appear to be effective, but treatment with bisphosphonates has been shown to
be effective.

Drug-Induced Liver Injury
Jayant A. Talwalkar, MD, MPH, and John J. Poterucha, MD

Despite increased awareness through the efforts of public and
regulatory agencies, the syndrome known as drug-induced
liver injury (DILI) is still a major public health problem in the
United States and the world. Moreover, it is the single most
common reason for US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
regulatory actions, including the removal of drugs from the
marketplace because of DILI. Although the frequency of this
clinical syndrome is low within populations, a signiﬁcant
clinical and economic burden is generated by DILI. This
chapter highlights new developments in the ﬁeld of idiosyncratic DILI and provides information about DILI from
acetaminophen.

Clinical Epidemiology of Drug-Induced
Liver Injurya

Worldwide, the annual incidence rate of DILI is estimated to
be between 13.9 and 24 cases per 100,000 population, and the
syndrome accounts for an estimated 3% to 9% of all adverse
drug reactions reported to health authorities. The United
States Acute Liver Failure Study Group reported that acetaminophen and idiosyncratic drug reactions combined
account for approximately 50% of cases of acute liver failure
in the United States. DILI also is recognized as the most
common identiﬁed cause of acute liver failure that requires
liver transplantation in the United States.
Results on the detailed clinical epidemiology of DILI from
prospective national registries have been published recently.
Data from the Regional Registry of Hepatotoxicity in Spain
indicates that 461 cases of DILI were identiﬁed between 1994

virus

and 2004. In this experience, hepatocellular damage was the
most common pattern observed (58%), and nearly 12% of
patients with jaundice at presentation required liver transplantation or died, compared with only 4% of patients who
were not jaundiced. The main causative medications were
antibiotics (32% of cases), followed by central nervous system
drugs (17% of cases), musculoskeletal drugs (17% of cases),
and gastrointestinal drugs (10% of cases). Amoxicillinclavulanic acid (Augmentin) was the most commonly implicated drug in this cohort. Among the ﬁrst 300 subjects enrolled
in the ongoing NIH Drug-Induced Liver Injury Network
(DILIN) prospective study, an estimated 73% of cases resulted
from taking a single prescription medication, 9% were attributed to herbal and dietary supplements, and 18% resulted
from subjects taking multiple agents. The mortality rate for
subjects followed for at least 6 months was 8%, although the
cause of death was liver related in only 44% of subjects. Among
subjects with DILI caused by a single prescription drug, the
major classes of implicated agents were antimicrobials (46%),
central nervous system agents (15%), immunomodulatory
agents (5%), analgesics (5%), and lipid-lowering agents (3%).
As in the Spanish registry, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid was the
drug most commonly implicated.

Drug Metabolism

Orally administered drugs are lipid-soluble, which allows
them to be absorbed into cells and to affect biologic processes.
Drug-metabolizing systems convert the parent drug into
water-soluble compounds, which allow excretion into the bile
and urine. The metabolizing systems are divided into phase I
and phase II reactions. Phase I reactions involve the cytochrome P-450 (CYP) family of enzymes and include the addition of polar groups by oxidation, reduction, or hydrolysis.
The metabolites formed by phase I reactions may be toxic if
not subsequently excreted or further metabolized. Activity of

Hypersensitivity

Liver injury from hypersensitivity usually follows 1 to 5 weeks
of exposure to the drug and is accompanied by rash, fever,
and eosinophilia and recurs with rechallenge. Although the
features of hypersensitivity are very suggestive of DILI, hypersensitivity features are seen in only about 20% of all cases
of idiosyncratic DILI. Examples of drugs that can result in
a hypersensitivity reaction are sulfonamides, amoxicillinclavulanic acid, phenytoin, and halothane.
Autoimmune

phase I reactions is inﬂuenced by age, other drugs, and toxins
(Table 31.1). The CYP3A subfamily is the most prominent
P-450 system involved in drug metabolism.
Phase II reactions further enhance the water solubility of a
compound and generally involve conjugation of glucuronide,
sulfate, acetate, glycine, or glutathione to a polar group.
Occasionally, phase II reactions may affect the parent compound directly (ie, without a previous phase I reaction).
Dietary factors, including nutritional status, can alter the activity of phase II reactions. The inﬂuence of alterations in drugmetabolizing systems on DILI is not understood completely.

Mechanisms of Drug-Induced Liver Injury

DILI is largely an unsolved problem because of the limitations
of our knowledge about the mechanisms of hepatic toxicity.
Traditionally, the classiﬁcation of injury patterns with DILI
are based on speciﬁc histologic features such as inﬂammation,
cholestasis, sinusoidal cell injury, immune-mediated damage,
mitochondrial injury, and oxidative stress. Liver biopsy samples may show such pathologic features as prominent eosinophilia, granulomas, zonal or massive necrosis, or cholestasis
with hepatitis. The usefulness of histologic examination of the
liver is limited by knowledge about DILI, particularly information on the patterns of injury caused by various agents.
DILI can be divided broadly into direct chemical toxicity
and idiosyncratic reactions. Direct toxicity is dose related; the
most common example is the hepatotoxicity associated with
acetaminophen. Direct toxicity usually occurs after a brief
exposure. For a given drug, there is considerable variability in
the dose required to cause toxicity, largely because of individual differences in drug metabolism. These differences can be
genetic or due to exogenous effectors of drug metabolism.
In contrast to the relatively predictable dose-related toxicity from acetaminophen, the more common idiosyncratic
hepatotoxic reactions appear related to genetic or environmental inﬂuences, or both, that are less well understood. Most
drug-induced hepatotoxicity is metabolic, which involves the
accumulation of toxic metabolites within hepatocytes that
leads to necrosis and inﬂammation. Recent investigations
have identiﬁed several categories of idiosyncratic DILI, as
discussed below.

Autoimmune-mediated DILI may be caused by speciﬁc drugs,
and the immune responses mimic those typically observed in
de novo or idiopathic autoimmune hepatitis. Hydralazine,
minocycline, and nitrofurantoin are drugs that precipitate
autoimmune DILI. Although it is difﬁcult to distinguish autoimmune DILI from autoimmune hepatitis on the basis of history, laboratory ﬁndings, and histologic features, the absence
of relapse after the withdrawal of corticosteroid therapy is
highly suggestive of a drug-induced autoimmune reaction.
Cholestasis

Drug-induced cholestasis may occur as an acute disorder
manifesting as canalicular (bland jaundice), hepatocanalicular
(cholestatic hepatitis), or ductular (cholangiolar hepatitis)
disease. Chronic cholestasis often results from the vanishing
bile duct syndrome. Amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, erythromycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, chlorpromazine, and
oral contraceptives typically produce this form of DILI.
Steatosis

The deposition of small or large fat droplets in the liver is
another recognized form of DILI. Microvesicular steatosis
generally indicates acute disease, whereas macrovesicular
steatosis or the combination of both microvesicular steatosis
and macrovesicular steatosis occur with chronic exposure.
Salicylate, valproic acid, amiodarone, and tamoxifen typically
have been associated with this form of DILI.
Sinusoidal Obstruction Syndrome

Sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (formerly, venoocclusive
disease) is diagnosed most often in patients who have received
a myeloablative chemotherapeutic regimen before undergoing
stem cell transplantation for malignancy. This syndrome is
seen also after exposure to 5-ﬂuorouracil, oxaliplatin, cytosine
arabinoside, actinomycin, dacarbazine, or plicamycin, and,
occasionally, azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine. The diagnosis usually is based on the ﬁndings of hepatomegaly, weight
gain, and hyperbilirubinemia. In some cases, histologic examination of the liver may be required. Management is largely
supportive. The mortality rate is as high as 20%.

31 Drug-Induced Liver Injury

Clinical Risk Factors

Increasing age is associated with DILI caused by several
common drugs, including isoniazid, erythromycin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, and nitrofurantoin. The reason age affects
the risk for DILI is not clear because phase I and II metabolizing enzyme activities are not altered markedly in older people.
In contrast to earlier data, recent studies have not conﬁrmed
an increased predisposition to DILI among women in comparison with men. However, men and women might have differences in susceptibility to particular agents that cause DILI.
For example, the majority of patients who have acute liver failure or require liver transplantation because of DILI are
women. Recent studies also suggest that the daily dose of a
drug might inﬂuence the development of DILI, which is in
contrast to previous concepts. Of US prescription medicines,
daily doses greater than 10 mg/day have been associated signiﬁcantly with liver failure, liver transplantation, and death
from DILI. The role of alcohol in idiosyncratic DILI is debated,
and the inﬂuence of underlying chronic liver disease as a risk
factor for DILI is not known. Clearly, patients with underlying
liver disease are at increased risk for adverse outcomes, compared with those without liver disease.
Clinical Presentation

The clinical presentation of DILI varies with the severity of
injury to the liver. Patients with mild DILI (eg, an increase in
the level of aspartate aminotransferase [AST], alanine aminotransferase [ALT], or alkaline phosphatase [or a combination of these] and normal levels of total bilirubin) are either
asymptomatic or have nonspeciﬁc symptoms such as fatigue
and nausea. Moderate-to-severe DILI is accompanied often by
abdominal pain, jaundice, and pruritus. Rash, fever, facial
edema, and lymphadenopathy, in combination with eosinophilia or atypical lymphocytosis, may be present with hypersensitivity-type reactions. Coagulopathy, renal dysfunction,
and mental status changes, when present, are seen typically in
cases of fulminant DILI.

Diagnosis

There is no speciﬁc test for DILI. The maxim that “almost any
drug can do almost anything” is important to consider when
evaluating patients who have abnormal liver test results.
Although the time between the initiation of medication use
and the onset of hepatotoxicity varies, most cases of DILI
occur within a year after treatment is started with the drug.
DILI should be suspected when liver injury occurs soon after
the initiation of treatment with an agent (within 4 weeks), or
after an increase in the dose of an agent that had been administered previously.
Generally, the exclusion of other causes of liver disease is
required before the diagnosis of DILI is made. Screening for
hepatitis A, B, and C infections, alcoholic or autoimmune

345

hepatitis, biliary tract disorders, and hemodynamic problems
is required. Although infections are less common, testing to
exclude cytomegalovirus and Epstein-Barr virus infections is
helpful. Hepatitis E infection can cause liver injury, speciﬁcally in developing countries. If this is suspected, the presence
of antibody needs to be detected. Also, biliary abnormalities,
through obstruction or infection, can injure the liver, as in
cholecystitis and cholangitis. If this is suspected, the biliary
tree should be imaged, initially with ultrasonography and then
with computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging
(Fig. 31.1). Also, resolution of the injury after withdrawal of
the drug (“dechallenge”) is helpful in conﬁrming the diagnosis of DILI, although the timing of improvement after the
withdrawal varies.
DILI can be characterized biochemically as speciﬁc patterns of injury, such as hepatocellular, cholestatic, or mixed
(Table 31.2), with the use of the R ratio, deﬁned by the following equation:
R=

ALT (measured in multiples of ULN)
ples of ULN)
ALP (measured in multip

where ALP is alkaline phosphatase and ULN is upper limit of
normal.
The liver injury pattern is hepatocellular when, at presentation, R exceeds 5, cholestatic when R is less than 2, and mixed
when 5> R >2. An important issue in calculating the R ratio is
which values to use during the course of illness. For example, in
the DILIN study, R was calculated for 192 patients in whom
DILI was thought due to a single agent. When R was calculated
using the values obtained initially in the study, 57% of patients
had the hepatocellular pattern of injury, 21% had the mixed
pattern, and 22% had the cholestatic pattern. However, when R
was calculated at the time of the peak serum levels of bilirubin,
then 45% of patients had the hepatocellular pattern, 37% the
cholestatic pattern, and 17% the mixed pattern. Consequently,
a shift occurs in the alkaline phosphatase levels relative to those
of ALT during DILI and the later in the course of disease that
values are obtained for calculating R, the more likely the patient
is to have a mixed or cholestatic pattern of injury.
Many drugs cause mild, often insigniﬁcant, and transient
increases in liver enzyme levels within a few months. These
usually represent an adaptive response to the drug and do not
necessitate withdrawal of treatment with the agent. For example, isoniazid increases the ALT level more than 3 times the
upper limit of normal in 15% of patients, but the enzyme levels
usually normalize despite continued treatment. Generally,
there should be concern about clinically signiﬁcant DILI when
liver enzyme levels increase more than 5 times the upper limit
of normal or when impaired liver function is noted.
Ultimately, the level of certainty for making a diagnosis of
DILI is related to the clinical history, chronology of exposure
and injury, exclusion of competing causes, and previous
knowledge of DILI with a speciﬁc agent through clinical
experience and published data. Outside of clinical practice,
several causality assessment systems have been developed to

identify the likelihood of suspected DILI and an implicated
agent in research settings. Recent studies have shown that the
results from these assessment systems are not well reproduced
among multiple users, thus limiting their usefulness in research
and clinical work. More precise algorithms and ones easier to
use in clinical practice are being developed.

Histologic Patterns of Drug-Induced
Liver Injury

No unique patterns unequivocally conﬁrm the diagnosis of
DILI. Notably, the results of histologic examination of the liver

injury is more prominent in the initial few weeks of injury;
cholestatic features, however, are more prominent later in
the course of disease. The two main categories of histologic
change that can be observed are 1) acute and chronic hepatitis
and 2) acute and chronic cholestasis/mixed hepatocellularcholestatic injury.
Acute and Chronic Hepatitis

The dominant feature in this pattern is expansion of the
portal area by a mononuclear inﬁltrate in the presence of
interface hepatitis. Also, involvement of bile ducts by inﬂammation or reactive changes may be seen. The parenchyma
has scattered foci of inﬂammation and usually apoptotic
hepatocytes. At the severe end of liver injury, lobular
disarray, areas of conﬂuent necrosis, and central venulitis
without true venoocclusive changes may be observed.
Microgranulomas are common in cases of DILI due to
allopurinol and phenytoin.

347

Acute and Chronic Cholestasis/Mixed
Hepatocellular-Cholestatic Injury

The acute or intrahepatic cholestatic pattern is deﬁned as
hepatocellular or canalicular bile stasis (or both) in the absence
of marked inﬂammation. If intrahepatic cholestasis is associated with one of the necroinﬂammatory patterns described for
hepatocellular injury, the pattern is categorized as mixed hepatocellular-cholestatic injury or cholestatic hepatitis. Bile duct
injury is usually present, although pronounced duct loss suggests a chronic disorder such as primary biliary cirrhosis or
primary sclerosing cholangitis. The combination of cholestasis with inﬂammation and hepatic injury is a common histologic pattern of injury in DILI.

Examples of Drug-Induced Liver Injury
Acetaminophen

The most common cause of acute liver failure in the
United States and Europe is acetaminophen toxicity. The
metabolism of acetaminophen is shown in Figure 31.2.
Decreases in glutathione found in patients with chronic liver
disease predispose to the production of the toxic metabolite.
Also, patients with chronic excessive intake of alcohol produce
more of the toxic intermediate because of the induction of
CYP2E1 activity.
Adding to the role of acetaminophen in acute liver failure,
acetaminophen adducts (N-acetyl-p-quinoneimine bound to
protein) have been identiﬁed in 20% of cases of “indeterminate” acute liver failure. More than half of these cases have
been “therapeutic misadventures,” in which patients inadvertently ingested toxic doses of acetaminophen. Many of these
patients have chronic alcoholism, which up-regulates the production of the toxic metabolites of acetaminophen.
Acetaminophen hepatotoxicity is characterized by very
high levels of aminotransferases, often more than 5,000 U/mL.
Renal failure is also common. The degree of increase in the
AST level at the time of presentation following an acetaminophen overdose is helpful in predicting hepatotoxicity. Patients
with AST levels less than 50 U/mL at presentation rarely
develop hepatotoxicity, whereas 16% of those with AST levels
more than 1,000 U/mL at presentation die or need liver transplantation. Patients with acetaminophen hepatotoxicity and
poor prognostic markers should be hospitalized and their
condition monitored. The criteria for liver transplantation are
listed in Table 22.6 in Chapter 22. When N-acetylcysteine is
administered soon after acetaminophen has been ingested,
it acts by enhancing the conjugation and, thus, the water
solubility and excretion of N-acetyl-p-quinoneimine. When
administered later, after liver injury has developed,
N-acetylcysteine acts by antioxidant and antiinﬂammatory
mechanisms that are not well understood. N-acetylcysteine
also may enhance liver perfusion through inotropic and

vasodilatory effects. Although the efﬁcacy of N-acetylcysteine
diminishes when it is given more than 8 hours after acetaminophen has been ingested, it nonetheless should be given up to
24 hours after ingestion because of its putative hepatoprotective effects.
Antibiotics

Antibiotics are the drug class that most commonly causes
nonfulminant liver injury. Amoxicillin-clavulanic acid is the
most frequently reported antibiotic that causes hepatotoxicity.
Liver injury usually manifests within 1 to 4 weeks after treatment with the drug has been stopped, but it can occur even
later. The clinical presentation of DILI can be either hepatocellular or cholestatic. Similar to other forms of drug-induced
cholestatic liver injury, the cholestasis due to amoxicillinclavulanic acid may take weeks or months to resolve. Other
“classic” antibiotics associated with DILI are nitrofurantoin,
minocycline, isoniazid, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole,
erythromycin, and the ﬂuoroquinolones. Telithromycin, a
ketolide antibiotic that recently has been reported to cause
severe hepatotoxicity including the development of ascites,
received a label change and boxed warning about hepatotoxicity on its label from the FDA in 2007.

Antiretroviral Agents

Drugs against the human immunodeﬁciency virus (HIV)
cause hepatotoxicity in 2% to 18% of patients. Most episodes
of DILI are asymptomatic, and in most cases, increases in ALT
levels resolve spontaneously.
Of the protease inhibitors, ritonavir (especially at high
doses) has the highest risk of liver toxicity, with an incidence
of 3% to 9%. The newer protease inhibitor tipranavir has been
associated with severe hepatotoxicity, especially when used in
combination with ritonavir and particularly in patients with
hepatitis B or C.
Newer nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors such as
emtricitabine, abacavir, and tenofovir are associated with a
low incidence of increased ALT levels. The major toxic effect
of nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors is lactic acidosis
due to mitochondrial toxicity, which generally occurs after
several weeks or months of treatment. Histologic examination
of the liver usually shows steatosis, and the mortality rate is
high. Among patients with hepatitis C, the administration of
ribavirin to those also receiving didanosine or stavudine has
been associated with mitochondrial toxicity.
A hypersensitivity DILI reaction due to the nonnucleoside
reverse transcriptase inhibitor nevirapine occurs in 2.3%

31 Drug-Induced Liver Injury

of patients. This form of liver injury tends to develop within a
few weeks after the start of therapy. A different pattern of drug
injury has emerged with the use of nevirapine, in which the
onset of increases in liver enzyme levels occur after more than
16 weeks of therapy, consistent with direct or idiosyncratic
host-mediated liver injury. Patients who have chronic viral
hepatitis are likely at increased risk for toxicity with nevirapine therapy.
Herbal and Dietary Supplements

Herbal and dietary supplements are commonly used in the
United States and throughout the world. The clinical patterns
of presentation and severity of hepatotoxicity associated with
these supplements can be highly variable, even for the same
product.
According to the National Institutes of Health DILIN prospective study, herbal and dietary supplements were implicated in approximately 10% of consecutively enrolled cases of
DILI. Furthermore, in the Spanish registry, 2% of cases of DILI
were attributed to herbal remedies or dietary supplements.
Products that have been implicated include Hydroxycut,
Herbalife, green tea extract, chaparral, usnic acid, and black
cohosh. Both Hydroxycut and Herbalife have been assigned
warnings from the FDA on the basis of several documented
reports of severe liver injury, transplant, and death associated
with these compounds.
Herbal and dietary supplements should be considered in
the differential diagnosis of liver injury. Many patients do not
consider over-the-counter, nutritional, or herbal supplements
as “medicines;” thus, these agents may not be included when
patients are asked about medicines taken before the episode of
liver injury. Careful, repeated, and directed questioning is
required.
Lipid-Lowering Agents

Because of the frequency with which statins are prescribed,
there has been much interest in the potential liver toxicity of
these agents. Determining whether patients receiving statins
have DILI is difﬁcult because mild increases in liver enzyme
levels are common within 1 month after the initiation of statin
therapy, but the levels nearly always improve despite continued administration of these agents. Furthermore, mildly ﬂuctuating liver enzyme levels are seen also in hyperlipidemic
patients not receiving statin therapy. The presence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in many patients who are candidates
for statin therapy further confounds the issue, although it has
been well demonstrated that statin drugs are safe for patients
with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.
Serious DILI from statin agents is rare. The risk of acute
liver failure associated with lovastatin, the ﬁrst of the statins to
be approved for treatment of hypercholesterolemia, is about 1
in 1 million patient-treatment years. From 1990 to 2002, only
3 of more than 51,000 liver transplants in the United States
were performed for presumed statin-induced liver injury.

349

Nevertheless, monitoring is still recommended, usually before
treatment is initiated and 12 weeks after therapy is initiated.
Monitoring should be considered also after a change in
dose or the administration of a second lipid-lowering agent.
Statins rarely have been associated with the development of
autoimmune hepatitis, although the association may be only
coincidental.
Ezetimibe, which blocks the intestinal absorption of cholesterol, has been associated with increased liver enzyme levels
and, when administered in combination with statins, may
rarely cause clinically signiﬁcant hepatoxicity. Sustainedrelease niacin also may produce symptomatic hepatotoxicity.

Treatment and Prognosis of Drug-Induced
Liver Injury
Treatment

For most cases of drug-induced liver injury, treatment is based
on withdrawal of the agent and general support. For acetaminophen toxicity, N-acetylcysteine should be given. Carnitine
may be helpful for valproic acid-induced microvesicular steatosis. Drug-induced autoimmune hepatitis that does not
improve spontaneously can be treated with corticosteroids.
Recently, the US Acute Liver Failure Study Group reported
the results of a randomized controlled trial examining intravenous N-acetylcysteine for the treatment of acute liver failure
by causes other than acetaminophen. In this prospective,
double-blind trial, patients with acute liver failure (nonacetaminophen) were randomly assigned to receive N-acetylcysteine
or placebo infusion for 72 hours. Acute liver failure caused by
DILI (n=45) represented the single largest group among the
173 patients. Although the overall survival at 3 weeks was not
signiﬁcantly different between the groups, transplant-free survival was signiﬁcantly better for patients in the N-acetylcysteine
group (40% vs 27%, P=0.43). The beneﬁts of N-acetylcysteine
were seen primarily in patients with early-stage disease, with
coma grade I or II (52% vs 30% transplant-free survival), but
not in those with advanced coma grade (III-IV) at randomization. When the overall and transplant-free survival of the four
largest etiologic groups was considered, patients with DILI
and hepatitis B virus infection showed improved outcome, in
comparison with patients in the autoimmune hepatitis indeterminate groups. For the DILI patients, the transplant-free
survival was 58% for those receiving N-acetylcysteine, compared with 27% for those receiving placebo. The study results
suggest that therapy with intravenous N-acetylcysteine should
be considered for patients with acute liver failure due to idiosyncratic DILI.
Cholestatic liver injury is less likely to be serious than hepatocellular drug injury but is more likely to be prolonged.
Ursodiol has been used in cases of drug-induced cholestasis,
with a prolonged recovery phase. Responses have been
reported, but the lack of controlled data makes it difﬁcult to
draw conclusions about the efﬁcacy of ursodiol.

350

Section VI Liver

Prognosis

The prognosis of DILI varies. According to Hy’s rule (named
after the hepatologist Hyman Zimmerman), patients with
jaundice due to drug-induced hepatocellular injury have a
10% mortality rate without transplantation, even if treatment
with the drug is discontinued promptly. This rule has been
conﬁrmed by recent studies from Spain, Sweden, and the
United States that reported mortality rates between 9% and
12% for patients with hepatocellular jaundice. Patients with
acute liver failure due to idiosyncratic drug injury have an
80% mortality rate without transplantation. Thus, patients
who have hepatocellular DILI and jaundice in whom encephalopathy or coagulopathy develops should be referred for consideration of liver transplantation.
Whether chronic DILI will develop after a patient recovers
from an acute injury is not clear. Most patients with DILI
who survive have complete biochemical and histologic
recovery. Yet, a small proportion of patients may have chronically increased serum levels of liver enzymes that may signify
chronicity. A recent follow-up study of DILI patients from
Sweden (mean duration, 10 years) concluded that the development of clinically important liver disease after severe DILI
was highly uncommon. A prospective follow-up of DILI
patients in the Spanish hepatotoxicity registry showed a 5%
incidence of chronic DILI; in comparison, 14% of patients in
the DILIN study had persistent laboratory abnormalities.
Further study is needed to determine the frequency and impact
of chronic DILI.

Pharmacogenetics of Drug-Induced
Liver Injury

There is considerable interest in identifying the genes that
contribute to DILI. Before the year 2000, little information
was available on genetic susceptibility to DILI. However, both
genome-wide association and candidate gene studies have
recently conﬁrmed an important role for HLA class I and class II
genes in some but not all forms of DILI. A recently identiﬁed
association between DILI due to ﬂucloxacillin and the HLAB∗5701 allele is, to date, the strongest reported association
between any gene and DILI (odds ratio = 80). The second replicated HLA association is between amoxicillin-clavulanate–
related DILI and the HLA class II allele DRB1∗1501. Also,
evidence for the association between a polymorphism in the

gene encoding N-acetyltransferase 2 (NAT2), an enzyme
important in isoniazid metabolism, and susceptibility to DILI
has been conﬁrmed. Persons positive for NAT2 variants associated with slow acetylation appear to have an increased risk of
isoniazid-related DILI.
However, not all genetic effects relevant to DILI will necessarily be of the magnitude identiﬁed in genome-wide association studies, and larger studies may be needed to detect genes
with smaller effects. Emerging techniques such as wholegenome sequencing will be needed for further progress in this
area of study.

Autoimmune Hepatitisa
Kymberly D. Watt, MD, and Albert J. Czaja, MD

Autoimmune hepatitis is a self-perpetuating inﬂammation of
the liver of unknown cause that is associated with autoantibodies, hypergammaglobulinemia, and interface hepatitis
seen on histologic examination. Autoimmune hepatitis afﬂicts
100,000 to 200,000 persons in the United States annually and
accounts for 5.9% of liver transplantations performed in the
United States. Among white northern Europeans, its mean
annual incidence is 1.9 per 100,000, and its point prevalence is
16.9 per 100,000. Autoimmune hepatitis occurs more commonly in women (female-to-male ratio, 3.6:1), and it affects
all ages, including infants.a
Originally described in white northern Europeans and
North Americans, the occurrence of autoimmune hepatitis is
now recognized to be worldwide. Ethnic background may
affect its clinical presentation, and African-American patients
have a higher frequency of cirrhosis at presentation than white
North Americans. Alaskan natives have a higher occurrence of
acute icteric disease than nonnative patients; Arab patients

young children with severe disease; and Somali patients are
usually men with cholestatic features and a poor response to
corticosteroid treatment. These ﬁndings suggest that differences in genetic predisposition or regional differences in etiologic agents may affect the clinical phenotype.

Etiology

The cause of autoimmune hepatitis is unknown. Multiple
agents have been implicated as triggers of the disease, including
certain viruses (hepatitis A, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and measles viruses) and drugs (diclofenac, isoniazid, α-methyldopa,
minocycline, nitrofurantoin, and propylthiouracil). Hepatitis
A virus infection and minocycline have been implicated most
often worldwide. Most cases have no identiﬁable trigger.
Triggers may share epitopes that resemble self-antigens,
and they may break self-tolerance by overcoming antigenic
ignorance, mimicking sequestered epitopes, or generating
neoepitopes (or a combination of these). Molecular mimicry
between foreign antigens and self-antigens is the most frequently proposed initiating mechanism. A long lag time
between antigenic exposure and disease expression and the
persistence of disease after the disappearance of the triggering
event further complicate efforts to identify an etiologic basis.
Repeated exposures to the triggering antigen, in turn, may
trigger autoreactive responses against the liver and anatomically distant organs, thereby causing not only autoimmune
hepatitis but concurrent immune diseases.
Diagnosis

An international panel has codiﬁed the diagnostic criteria,
and deﬁnite diagnosis requires the exclusion of hereditary

(Wilson’s disease, genetic hemochromatosis, and alpha1antitrypsin deﬁciency), viral (hepatitis A, B, and C virus
infections), and drug-induced (diclofenac, isoniazid, propylthiouracil, α-methyldopa, minocycline, or nitrofurantoinrelated) conditions. Table 32.1 is a simpliﬁed (more clinically
relevant) version of the diagnostic criteria for probable and
deﬁnite autoimmune hepatitis.
The 6-month requirement to establish chronicity has been
waived, because an acute, rarely fulminant, presentation has
been recognized that may resemble acute viral or toxic hepatitis. A marked increase (more than twofold the upper limit of
normal) in the serum alkaline phosphatase level or the presence of pruritus suggests another diagnosis. Celiac disease can
be associated with a liver disease that resembles autoimmune
hepatitis, and it should be excluded in patients.
Interface hepatitis is the histologic hallmark of autoimmune hepatitis (Fig. 32.1). The morphologic pattern is nonspeciﬁc and occurs in acute and chronic liver disease of diverse
causes. Plasma cell inﬁltration of the hepatic parenchyma or
portal tracts (or both) is apparent in 66% of tissue specimens,
but its presence is neither speciﬁc nor required for the diagnosis (Fig. 32.2). A lobular, or panacinar, hepatitis frequently
accompanies interface hepatitis, and a centrilobular (zone 3)
necrosis has also been described. Successive examinations of
liver tissue have shown transition of the centrilobular (zone 3)
necrosis to interface hepatitis, and it may be an early form of
the disease.
A scoring system that grades individual components of the
syndrome provides an objective means to assess the strength
of the diagnosis, accommodate unusual features, and compare
populations in different geographic regions and treatment
trials (Alvarez et al in the suggested reading list). The scoring

system has been developed as a research tool to ensure homogeneous populations in research studies; it usually is not
needed for a conﬁdent clinical diagnosis. A simpliﬁed scoring
system has been developed to ease clinical application, and it
has a sensitivity of 88% and a speciﬁcity of 97% for autoimmune hepatitis (Table 32.1).

32 Autoimmune Hepatitis

Clinical Features

Women constitute at least 70% of cases, and 50% are younger
than 40 years (Table 32.2). Onset is usually between the third
and ﬁfth decades, but the age at onset may range from infancy
to the extreme elderly. Autoimmune hepatitis tends to be
more severe in children than in adults. Children commonly
have cirrhosis at presentation (as many as 50%), and, during
therapy, they enter a sustained remission less often than adults,
especially if they have antibodies to liver/kidney microsome
type 1 (anti-LKM1). Cholangiographic abnormalities that
have been designated as autoimmune sclerosing cholangitis can
occur in children, and they may not be accompanied by cholestatic features, inﬂammatory bowel disease, or refractoriness
to corticosteroid treatment. In contrast, adults with autoimmune hepatitis and similar cholangiographic ﬁndings typically have inﬂammatory bowel disease and a poor response to
corticosteroid therapy.
Elderly patients more commonly have cirrhosis at presentation and concurrent thyroid (Graves’ disease or autoimmune
thyroiditis) or rheumatic (rheumatoid arthritis, Sjögren’s syndrome, or systemic lupus erythematosus) disorders than
young adult patients. Elderly white patients from North
America or northern Europe have HLA-DRB1∗04 more often
and HLA-DRB1∗03 less frequently than young adult patients
with a similar ethnic background, and they respond well to
corticosteroid therapy. These ﬁndings suggest that elderly
patients have triggering events that are different from those of
young adults or that their genetic phenotype is associated with
a less vigorous immune response.

353

Forty percent of patients have an abrupt onset of symptoms, and a fulminant presentation is possible, especially in
the young. Autoimmune hepatitis also may have an indolent
clinical course that exacerbates spontaneously and resembles
acute hepatitis. Features of chronic liver disease, including
hypergammaglobulinemia and ﬁbrosis or cirrhosis seen on
histologic examination, are common in these patients. In
others with an acute presentation, the ﬁndings are indistinguishable from those of severe acute hepatitis; the histologic
features include interface and lobular hepatitis without ﬁbrosis or cirrhosis. The acute severe and fulminant presentations
of autoimmune hepatitis are important to recognize because
the institution of corticosteroid therapy can be beneﬁcial in
36% to 100% of these patients.
Autoimmune hepatitis is asymptomatic in 25% to 34% of
patients at presentation. Symptomatic and asymptomatic
patients have similar histologic features, including the occurrence of cirrhosis. Many asymptomatic patients (26%) have
inactive cirrhosis, and their survival is not enhanced with corticosteroid treatment. Similarly, asymptomatic patients without cirrhosis who have mild inﬂammatory activity can have
10-year life expectancies that exceed 80% without treatment.
In these instances, the absence of symptoms is associated with
stable inactive or minimally active disease, and treatment is
not warranted. Asymptomatic patients commonly become
symptomatic (26%–70%), and they must be monitored regularly for progressive disease activity. The absence of symptoms
is not a justiﬁcation for withholding treatment from patients
who otherwise have active disease.
Symptomatic patients typically have easy fatigability. Other
symptoms include myalgia, arthralgia, anorexia, jaundice or
dark urine, and, less commonly, cosmetic changes (facial
rounding, hirsutism, or acne), delayed menarche or amenorrhea, obscure fever (rarely as high as 40°C), and right upper
quadrant discomfort. Pruritus and weight loss are unusual,
and they suggest an alternative diagnosis or a disease complicated by biliary obstruction or hepatocellular cancer.
Physical Findings

Most patients with autoimmune hepatitis have normal physical examination ﬁndings despite severe inﬂammatory activity
(Table 32.2). Hepatomegaly is the most common physical ﬁnding. Ascites and hepatic encephalopathy are indicative of
advanced liver disease and cirrhosis, and they usually are not
noted at presentation. The clinical features of acne, hirsutism,
obesity, and amenorrhea in young women that originally constituted the syndrome of “lupoid hepatitis” are now rarely seen.

Laboratory Features

Abnormalities in serum aminotransferase levels are essential
for the diagnosis of autoimmune hepatitis (Table 32.2). The
serum γ-globulin level is typically, but not invariably, increased,
and the diagnosis is suspect without this ﬁnding. The serum

354

Section VI Liver

γ-globulin level is usually polyclonal, and the predominant
elevation is the serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) level. The
importance of the serum IgG level in diagnosing autoimmune
hepatitis is evident by its importance in the simpliﬁed diagnostic scoring system (Table 32.1).
In most instances, the serum aminotransferase level at
presentation does not exceed 500 U/L (range, 150 U/L to >1,000
U/L), and the γ-globulin level ranges from 2 to 3 g/dL.
Hyperbilirubinemia is present in 83% of patients with
severe inﬂammatory activity, but the serum bilirubin concentration exceeds 3 mg/dL in only 46%. Similarly, an
abnormal increase in the serum level of alkaline phosphatase
can be demonstrated in 81% of patients, but it is more
than twofold the upper limit of the normal range in only 33%
and more than fourfold of the upper limit of normal in
only 10%.
HLA-DRB1∗03, HLA-DRB1∗04, and a combination of
both are the principal risk factors for autoimmune hepatitis in
white North American and northern European patients, and
they are found in 85% of cases. HLA-DRB1∗03 is associated
with early-age onset, diminished response to corticosteroids,
and frequent requirement for liver transplantation. HLADRB1∗04 is associated with disease onset at age 45 years or
older, female sex, and frequent concurrent immune diseases.
HLA typing has not been endorsed as a diagnostic or prognostic tool, but it may prove useful in determining etiologic factors and populations at risk for the disease.

anti-LC1 identify young patients who have aggressive disease.
Cryptogenic chronic hepatitis may be reclassiﬁed as autoimmune hepatitis by repeat testing for the conventional autoantibodies or testing for the nonstandard markers (pANCA or
anti-SLA).
Antimitochondrial antibodies (AMA), including those
against the M2 antigens associated with primary biliary cirrhosis, occur in 8% to 20% of patients with autoimmune hepatitis. Assays based on indirect immunoﬂuorescence may
mistake anti-LKM1 for AMA because the diagnostic patterns
of indirect immunoﬂuorescence on the murine kidney tubule
can be confused. Other patients may have an overlap syndrome with primary biliary cirrhosis, early-stage primary biliary cirrhosis, or coincidental collateral autoantibody
production. In patients with otherwise classic autoimmune
hepatitis, AMA have not affected treatment response.
ANA and SMA can occur in acute and chronic hepatitis of
diverse causes, including alcoholic liver disease, nonalcoholic
fatty liver disease, and viral hepatitis. They are usually low
titer, background reactivities that should not alter diagnosis or
management. Anti-LKM1 have been found in as many as 10%
of European patients with chronic hepatitis C and are different from the anti-LKM1 found in classic autoimmune hepatitis. Autoantibodies, regardless of titer or type, expand the
differential diagnosis, but they alone never establish the true
diagnosis of the disease.

(SMA), and anti-LKM1 are the serologic markers of autoimmune hepatitis, and they should be measured in all patients
with suspected disease. They are not pathogenic, and serum
titers do not have prognostic signiﬁcance. Low titers should
not dissuade the diagnosis if other features implicate the disorder. The conventional autoantibodies may not be present in
some patients at presentation, but may be detected later in the
disease course; serum titers can ﬂuctuate during the course of
illness.
Other autoantibodies that support the diagnosis of autoimmune hepatitis and whose assay generally is available are
perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (pANCA),
which occur in 50% to 90% of patients with type 1 autoimmune hepatitis. pANCA may be useful in the evaluation of
seronegative (“cryptogenic”) chronic hepatitis. In this same
fashion, immunoglobulin A antibodies to tissue transglutaminase or endomysium are useful for excluding the liver disease
associated with celiac disease.
Antibodies that have not been incorporated into a conventional diagnostic algorithm are antibodies to actin (anti-actin),
soluble liver antigen (anti-SLA), asialoglycoprotein receptor
(anti-ASGPR), chromatin, and liver cytosol type 1 (anti-LC1).
Anti-ASGPR, anti-chromatin, and anti-SLA are associated
with relapse after treatment withdrawal, and anti-actin and

Concurrent immune diseases are present in 30% to 48% of
patients with autoimmune hepatitis (Table 32.3). Autoimmune

Two types of autoimmune hepatitis (types 1 and 2) have been
proposed on the basis of serologic markers (Table 32.4). The
International Autoimmune Hepatitis Group has not endorsed
these subclassiﬁcations because each type lacks a speciﬁc etiologic agent, distinctive clinical behavior, or requirement for a
particular treatment. Nevertheless, the designations have
become useful clinical descriptors and research classiﬁcations.
Treatment Regimens

Prednisone alone or a lower dose of prednisone in combination with azathioprine is effective in the treatment of all forms
of autoimmune hepatitis. Each regimen induces clinical,
laboratory, and histologic remission in 65% of patients within

18 months and in 80% within 3 years (Fig. 32.3). Each schedule also enhances survival expectations. The life expectancy of
treated patients exceeds 80% after 20 years of observation, and
it is similar to that of age- and sex-matched normal persons
from the same geographic region. Improvement in hepatic
ﬁbrosis occurs in conjunction with reductions in liver inﬂammation, and corticosteroids suppress inﬂammatory activity.
The absolute and relative indications for treatment are
based on degrees of severity as assessed by clinical, laboratory,
and histologic ﬁndings (Table 32.5). Patients with inactive cirrhosis, portal or mild interface hepatitis and no symptoms, or
decompensated inactive cirrhosis with ascites, encephalopathy,
or gastrointestinal tract bleeding (or a combination) do not
warrant immediate immunosuppressive therapy. The diagnosis of autoimmune hepatitis does not compel the prompt institution of treatment, nor does the absence of symptoms
preclude the need for therapy. Autoimmune hepatitis is by
nature an aggressive liver disease with varying disease activity,
and this unpredictable nature has argued for treatment in
all patients with the diagnosis regardless of disease activity

at presentation. The urgency rather than the need for treatment
may be all that is affected by the presence of mild disease.
A preferred treatment schedule is prednisone in combination with azathioprine (Table 32.6). The combination schedule
uses a lower dose of prednisone, and it is associated with fewer
corticosteroid-related side effects. It is especially useful for
patients with obesity, acne, menopause, labile hypertension,
brittle diabetes, emotional lability, or osteopenia (or a combination of these). The prednisone-alone schedule is useful for
patients with severe, preexistent cytopenia, pregnancy or contemplation of pregnancy, or active malignancy. Both regimens
are similarly effective and differ only in the frequency of adverse
effects. Azathioprine has been teratogenic in animals, and it
is listed as a category D drug by the US Food and Drug
Administration. Although azathioprine has been used safely in
transplantation and inﬂammatory bowel disease, it has not
been studied rigorously in pregnancy, its metabolites cross the
placenta, and it is not essential in the treatment of autoimmune
hepatitis. Autoimmune hepatitis commonly improves during
pregnancy, and prednisone alone can be used to control
inﬂammatory activity. Postpartum exacerbations are possible,
and conventional dose therapy should be resumed immediately before delivery. Alternate-day corticosteroids in titrated
doses have not improved histologic features, and this regimen
has been abandoned in adults. Failure of the laboratory indices
of liver inﬂammation and function to improve (especially
hyperbilirubinemia) within 2 weeks after the start of corticosteroid therapy is associated with a higher early mortality rate.
Histologic improvement lags behind clinical and laboratory resolution by 3 to 8 months (Fig. 32.3), and therapy
should be continued for at least 3 to 6 months beyond this
point of improvement. Examination of a liver biopsy specimen before initial withdrawal of drug therapy is the only
method for conﬁrming histologic resolution. Treatment often
is maintained for at least 2 years before withdrawal of drug
therapy is considered. The end point of treatment requires the
absence of symptoms, resolution of all laboratory indices of
liver inﬂammation, and normal liver tissue.
Relapse

Relapse connotes the exacerbation of disease activity after
withdrawal of drug therapy, and it is characterized by an

increase in the serum level of aspartate aminotransferase
(AST) to at least threefold the upper limit of normal range.
From 50% to 86% of patients have disease relapse after remission, most often during the ﬁrst 6 months after the termination of therapy (50% of patients). Normalization of the serum
levels of AST, γ-globulin, and IgG in conjunction with histologic resolution decreases the relative risk of relapse after drug
withdrawal by 3- to 11-fold. The normalization of tests and
tissue does not ensure a sustained remission, and 60% of
patients who have achieved this result still have disease relapse.
The high frequency of relapse should not discourage the withdrawal of drug therapy if a complete resolution of clinical,
laboratory, and histologic abnormalities has been sustained.
Multiple relapses and re-treatment can be associated with progression to cirrhosis, liver failure, or need for liver transplantation, and a long-term maintenance regimen is justiﬁed after
the ﬁrst relapse.
The disease is ﬁrst controlled by reinstituting the original
drug schedule, and then the dose of azathioprine is increased
to 2 mg/kg daily as the dose of prednisone is gradually
decreased and then withdrawn. Over 80% of patients treated
in this fashion can be maintained in clinical and laboratory
remission during a 10-year period. Low-dose prednisone therapy can be used also as a long-term maintenance schedule
after the ﬁrst relapse. This strategy requires a careful decrease
in the daily maintenance dose of prednisone until the lowest
level is achieved to prevent symptoms and maintain serum
AST levels below threefold the upper limit of the normal
range.
Relapse does not preclude permanent discontinuation of
medication late in the course of the disease. Twenty-eight percent of patients who have disease relapse and are re-treated
eventually develop inactive disease, and drug therapy can be
withdrawn. The possibility of permanent withdrawal of drug
therapy justiﬁes periodic attempts at dose reduction.
Suboptimal Responses

The condition of 9% of patients deteriorates despite compliance with the drug regimen (treatment failure); 13% of
patients develop intolerable side effects and must stop taking
the medication prematurely (drug toxicity); and 13% improve
but not to a degree that satisﬁes remission criteria (incomplete
response). High-dose prednisone (60 mg daily) or prednisone
(30 mg daily) in conjunction with higher-dose azathioprine
(150 mg daily) is the treatment failure regimen that induces
laboratory remission in 75% of patients within 2 years. Only
20% of patients achieve histologic remission, and patients
remain at risk for progression of the disease and the development of treatment-related complications.
Other Treatments

Cyclosporine, tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, and budesonide are empirical therapies that have been used successfully

32 Autoimmune Hepatitis

in a small number of patients with drug intolerance or disease
recalcitrant to conventional regimens. Cyclosporine has been
administered as initial therapy, especially to children, and as
salvage therapy to children and adults, but its advantage over
standard regimens as ﬁrst-line or rescue treatment has not
been established. Similarly, tacrolimus has been used in only a
small number of patients, with a 91% remission rate when
added to prednisone and azathioprine (many of these patients
were not refractory to treatment, but treatment naïve). Small
clinical studies of mycophenolate mofetil suggest it is an effective substitute for azathioprine, particularly in cases of azathioprine intolerance, but its effect in cases of treatment failure
is less clear. Budesonide, with its ﬁrst-pass metabolism, has
been able to induce complete or partial laboratory resolution
in treatment-naïve patients, but it has not been effective as salvage therapy for patients with severe disease for which corticosteroid therapy failed or for patients dependent on this
medication. It may have a role as front-line therapy for patients
with mild disease or at risk for corticosteroid-related complications. Budesonide has been associated with adverse effects
in patients with cirrhosis, thus caution must be undertaken in
treating these patients.
Liver Transplantation

Liver transplantation is effective in the treatment of decompensated disease that is unresponsive to conventional therapies. The 5-year survival rate of patient and graft ranges from
83% to 92%, and the actuarial 10-year survival after transplantation is 75%. Autoimmune hepatitis recurs in at least
17% of patients after liver transplantation, and its occurrence
increases with the duration of observation after transplantation. Thirty-six percent of patients develop recurrent autoimmune hepatitis after 5 years. Recurrent disease is typically
mild and managed by adjustments in the immunosuppressive
regimen. Autoimmune hepatitis can develop de novo in 2.5%
to 3.4% of allografts of children and adults who received liver
transplants for liver diseases other than autoimmune hepatitis. Treatment with prednisone and azathioprine usually is
effective in suppressing disease activity.
Variant Syndromes

Patients with features of autoimmune hepatitis and another
liver disease (overlap syndrome) or ﬁndings that are similar to
but atypical of classic disease (outlier syndrome) constitute
the variant syndromes. Retrospective analyses have suggested
that 18% of cases of autoimmune liver disease can be reclassiﬁed as a variant form. Standardized diagnostic criteria are
lacking; the natural history is uncertain; and treatment algorithms have not been validated. The principal variant syndromes are autoimmune hepatitis with features of primary

357

biliary cirrhosis and autoimmune hepatitis with features of
primary sclerosing cholangitis.
Mixed hepatitic and cholestatic features are the most
important clues to the presence of a variant form. AMA, serum
levels of alkaline phosphatase increased to more than twofold
the upper limit of the normal range, concurrent inﬂammatory
bowel disease, histologic evidence of destructive cholangitis or
ductopenia, and recalcitrance to corticosteroid therapy justify
consideration of variant forms. Cholangiography is indicated
for excluding primary sclerosing cholangitis in all adults who
have autoimmune hepatitis and unexplained cholestatic clinical or biochemical features, ulcerative colitis, or refractoriness
to corticosteroid treatment.
Treatment is empirical and includes prednisone or prednisone in combination with ursodiol and with or without azathioprine. Patients with serum alkaline phosphatase levels less
than twice the upper limit of the normal range can experience
improvement with corticosteroid therapy (with/without azathioprine). Serum alkaline phosphatase levels more than twice
the upper limit of the normal range and the presence of
destructive cholangitis (ﬂorid duct lesion) seen on histologic
examination justify treatment with prednisone and ursodeoxycholic acid.
Features of autoimmune hepatitis can be present in chronic
hepatitis C, and hepatitis C virus viremia can be present in
autoimmune hepatitis. Interferon therapy for patients with
autoimmune hepatitis can exacerbate the autoimmune manifestations, and corticosteroid therapy for patients with chronic
hepatitis C will increase the viral load. Most patients have
chronic hepatitis C and autoimmune features that should be
treated in the same way as chronic viral hepatitis. Rare patients
have classic autoimmune hepatitis, including the characteristic histologic changes, and coincidental hepatitis C virus infection. Chronic hepatitis C in these patients is probably a
background ﬁnding, and corticosteroid therapy can improve
the predominant autoimmune disease.

Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Diseasea
Kymberly D. Watt, MD, and Paul Angulo, MD

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) refers to the accumulation of fat (mainly triglycerides) in hepatocytes that result
from insulin resistance. NAFLD is recognized as the most
common chronic liver disease in the Western world. NAFLD
encompasses a wide spectrum of disease from bland hepatic
steatosis, which is generally benign, to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which may progress to cirrhosis and liver failure.
Hence, distinguishing between hepatic steatosis and NASH has
important prognostic and management implications.a
NAFLD may be categorized as primary or secondary,
depending on the underlying pathogenesis (Table 33.1). Primary
NAFLD is the more common type and associated with insulin-resistant states, such as obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus,
and dyslipidemia. Other conditions associated with insulin
resistance, such as polycystic ovarian syndrome and hypopituitarism, have also been described in association with NAFLD;
however, the exact prevalence and signiﬁcance of NAFLD in
these conditions is not clear. The differentiation of primary
NAFLD from secondary types is important because they have
different treatments and prognosis. Primary NAFLD has
reached epidemic proportions in many countries, as demonstrated by several population-based studies. In the United
States, 34% of the population 30 to 65 years old and 9.6% of
the population 2 to 19 years old have hepatic steatosis. If these
ﬁgures are extrapolated to the US population, more than

55 million Americans have NAFLD. The prevalence of NAFLD
in the general population in the United States is almost 14-fold
higher than the prevalence of hepatitis C, which affects about
4 million people. It also is almost threefold higher than alcohol-induced liver disease. However, this high prevalence of
NAFLD contrasts with the relatively small proportion of
patients with NAFLD who show evidence of disease progression or develop complications of end-stage liver disease, as
described below.

are asymptomatic. They may complain of fatigue or malaise
and a sensation of fullness or discomfort in the right upper
abdomen. Hepatomegaly and acanthosis nigricans are
common physical ﬁndings in children, although stigmata of
chronic liver disease suggestive of cirrhosis are uncommon.
The most common clinical scenario leading to the diagnosis of NAFLD is an asymptomatic increase in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) not
due to viral hepatitis, autoimmune processes, iron overload,
or alcohol abuse. Aminotransferase levels, however, are
increased in only 20% of the general population with NAFLD.
The AST/ALT ratio is usually less than one, but this ratio
increases as ﬁbrosis advances. Fatty inﬁltration of the liver is
detected with ultrasonography or computed tomography
(CT) (as described below) and often is an incidental ﬁnding,
prompting further investigation or referrals.
Because NAFLD or NASH is commonly asymptomatic,
ﬁbrosis can progress unknowingly over many years and the
patient can present with cirrhosis. NAFLD also should be

considered as a possible differential diagnosis in cases of
“cryptogenic” cirrhosis. The prevalence of metabolic risk
factors such as diabetes mellitus and obesity is similar among
patients with cryptogenic cirrhosis and NASH, but less frequent among patients with cirrhosis of other causes, suggesting that NASH accounts for a substantial proportion of cases
of cryptogenic cirrhosis. Hepatic steatosis has been observed
to disappear over time in patients with NASH-related cirrhosis, potentially masking the diagnosis. Not infrequently, recurrent NASH occurs in patients who received a liver transplant
for cryptogenic cirrhosis. Rarely, NASH could be a consideration in patients who have subacute liver failure, because they
may have a background of asymptomatic NASH and an
unknown stimulus that precipitates liver failure (in an already
metabolically stressed liver).
Comorbidities Associated With Nonalcoholic
Fatty Liver Disease

The comorbidities most commonly associated with NAFLD
are the components of metabolic syndrome. Several slightly
different deﬁnitions have been published, but the most commonly used is the updated 2005 National Cholesterol
Education Program (Adult Treatment Panel III), shown in
Table 33.3. An associated condition not included in this deﬁnition is obstructive sleep apnea. Of patients with NAFLD,
50% to 90% are obese (body mass index [BMI] ≥30 kg/m2),
55% to 65% have dyslipidemia, and 60% to 70% have hypertension. Type 2 diabetes mellitus is present in 30% to 60% of
NAFLD patients, and up to 50% of nondiabetic patients may
have insulin resistance, if checked. Almost one-half of the
patients with NAFLD have metabolic syndrome (ie, at least
three features of the syndrome). Also, about 75% of lean

women), and all others (94 cm for men, 80 cm for women).

33 Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease

patients (BMI <25 kg/m2) with NAFLD have at least one feature of metabolic syndrome. Therefore, the presence of metabolic abnormalities increases the likelihood of NAFLD, but
these features are common in the general population and not
speciﬁc for the diagnosis.
Most patients with NAFLD who have a BMI of 35 kg/m2 or
more also meet the criteria for central obesity, as deﬁned by
waist circumference in Table 33.3. It has been demonstrated
that fat with an intra-abdominal (visceral) location is metabolically different from fat with a more peripheral or subcutaneous location. The presence and severity of NAFLD correlates
more strongly with central obesity than with the BMI. Some
patients with NAFLD may have a BMI less than 35 kg/m2 and
still have central obesity, whereas many persons with a high
BMI do not have NAFLD. Body fat distribution differs among
ethnic groups, and this may be one of the factors that explains
the differences in the prevalence of NAFLD among ethnic
groups in the United States. For example, the prevalence is
higher among adult Hispanics (45%) than among adult whites
(33%) and adult African-Americans (24%).
BMI can be affected also by volume status in a patient with
cirrhosis. Because the calculation relies on weight in kilograms, the presence of ascites and edema must be accounted
for clinically. In addition, although waist circumference is a
better measure in noncirrhotic patients than BMI, it is of
limited value in patients with ascites ﬂuid.
NAFLD is not only intricately tied to metabolic syndrome
but also to overt cardiovascular disease (and vice versa). In
patients with type 2 diabetes, up to 70% have ultrasonographic
evidence of NAFLD (86% have normal liver enzymes). These
patients with NAFLD have higher prevalence rates of cardiovascular disease than diabetic patients without NAFLD. In
patients undergoing coronary angiography, it has been shown
that the ultrasonographically conﬁrmed presence of NAFLD is
the strongest predictor of a positive angiogram (even stronger
than diabetes or smoking). Patients with carotid artery disease
seen on imaging were more likely to have not only increased
steatosis but also more necroinﬂammation and ﬁbrosis, as
seen in liver biopsy specimens.

361

Serum iron tests are commonly abnormal, and ferritin
levels are increased in up to 50% of patients and transferrin
saturation is increased in up to 10%. These ﬁndings potentially may lead to confusion about a diagnosis of hemochromatosis. The presence of heterozygous HFE gene mutations
does not appear to be associated with hepatic iron loading or
liver ﬁbrosis. Testing for antinuclear or anti-smooth muscle
antibodies (or both) is recommended for screening for autoimmune hepatitis in patients with chronically increased
enzyme levels. However, serum autoantibodies are present in
23% to 36% of patients with NAFLD, but the liver biopsy features help to exclude the diagnosis of autoimmune hepatitis in
most patients with NAFLD who test positive for antinuclear or
anti-smooth muscle antibodies (or both).
Imaging Features

Ultrasonography, CT, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
can be used to noninvasively diagnose fatty inﬁltration of the
liver. Hepatic steatosis causes increased echogenicity on ultrasonography, which can be contrasted with the lower echogenicity of the spleen or renal cortex (Fig. 33.1). The sensitivity
and speciﬁcity of ultrasonography for detecting hepatic

Biochemical Features

Serum liver enzyme abnormalities often are restricted to
an increase in the level of ALT or AST (or both), usually
less than ﬁvefold normal. Aminotransferase levels in
patients with NAFLD ﬂuctuate; at any one time, 78% of
patients have normal levels, but increased levels are detected
in more than 20% of these patients if the measurement
is repeated several times during follow-up. Alkaline phosphatase and γ-glutamyltransferase levels may be increased
modestly (generally less than threefold normal) in one-third
of patients but rarely is the level of one or both of these
enzymes increased without an increase in aminotransferase
levels. Hyperbilirubinemia, low albumin levels, or an increase
in the international normalized ratio usually indicates
advanced liver disease and cirrhosis.

steatosis vary from 80% to 94% and 88% to 95%, respectively
(to detect 30% or more of fatty inﬁltration). The sensitivity
and speciﬁcity of ultrasonography decrease in the presence of
morbid obesity to 49% and 75%, respectively. If detected with
ultrasonography, fatty inﬁltration is highly likely to be present, but not being detected with ultrasonography does not
rule out the diagnosis.
On noncontrast CT images, hepatic steatosis has a low
attenuation and appears darker than the spleen (Fig. 33.2).
The sensitivity of CT for detecting hepatic steatosis of more
than 33% is as high as 93%, with a positive predictive value of
76%. Both magnetic resonance phase contrast imaging techniques and magnetic resonance spectroscopy are reliable for
detecting steatosis and offer good correlation with the volume
of liver fat. A liver fat content of more than 5% apparent on

magnetic resonance spectroscopy indicates steatosis. However,
the routine application of MRI is limited by cost and lack of
availability.
Histologic Features

Histologically, NAFLD is indistinguishable from liver damage
that results from alcohol abuse. Liver biopsy features include
steatosis, mixed inﬂammatory cell inﬁltration, hepatocyte ballooning and necrosis, glycogen nuclei, Mallory’s hyaline, and
ﬁbrosis. The presence of steatosis alone or in combination
with the other features accounts for the wide spectrum of
NAFLD (Fig. 33.3). Steatosis is present predominantly as macrovesicular fat, although some hepatocytes may show an
admixture with microvesicular steatosis. When mild, fatty
inﬁltration is concentrated typically in acinar zone 3; moderate to severe fatty inﬁltration shows a more diffuse distribution. The inﬂammatory inﬁltrate usually consists of mixed
neutrophils and lymphocytes and predominates in zone 3.
Ballooning degeneration of hepatocytes results from the
intracellular accumulation of ﬂuid and is characterized by
swollen cells typically noted in zone 3 near the steatotic hepatocytes. Mallory’s hyaline is found in about one-half of adult
patients who have NAFLD and usually is located in ballooned
hepatocytes in zone 3, but it is neither unique nor speciﬁc for
NAFLD. The pattern of ﬁbrosis is one of the characteristic features of NAFLD. Collagen is laid down ﬁrst in the pericellular
space around the central vein and in the perisinusoidal region
in zone 3. In some areas, the collagen ﬁbers invest single cells
in a pattern referred to as “chicken-wire ﬁbrosis,” as described
in alcohol-induced liver damage. This pattern of ﬁbrosis helps
to distinguish NAFLD and alcoholic liver disease from other
forms of liver disease in which ﬁbrosis shows an initial portal
distribution (Fig. 33.3).
Portal tracts are relatively spared from inﬂammation,
although children with NAFLD may show a predominance of
portal-based injury instead of a lobular pericentral injury.
Mallory’s hyaline is notably sparse or absent in children with
NAFLD. In some patients with cirrhotic-stage NAFLD, the
features of steatosis and necroinﬂammatory activity may no
longer be present. Although liver biopsy is the “gold standard”
for diagnosing NASH and staging ﬁbrosis, sampling variability may underestimate the severity of liver injury in up to 30%
of patients.

Diagnosis

Figure 33.2 Features of hepatic steatosis visualized with computed

tomography. A, Normal liver has no attenuation of the signal
compared with the spleen, whereas, B, liver with fatty inﬁltration has
an attenuated signal compared with the spleen.

The “gold standard” for diagnosing NAFLD is clinicopathologic
correlation, based on the conﬁrmation of steatosis by liver
biopsy and appropriate exclusion of other causes (Table 33.2).
It is important to exclude alcohol abuse as the cause of fatty
liver. It is known that a minimal amount of alcohol of 20 g/day
(1–2 standard drinks) for women and 30 g/day (2–3 standard
drinks) for men can induce fatty liver, and these limits
are commonly used to distinguish between alcoholic and

nonalcoholic fatty liver. Secondary causes of NAFLD (Table 33.1)
should be excluded because NAFLD associated with these
conditions has a different course and treatment.
Patients with persistently increased serum levels of liver
enzymes should have other causes of NAFLD excluded by
clinical review and laboratory testing. Whether the liver should
be biopsied to establish the diagnosis of NAFLD needs to be
individualized. Liver biopsy may be useful for diagnosing
NAFLD when a potential differential diagnosis is suggested by
clinical, serologic, or biochemical testing. These situations
include the presence of autoantibodies or increased iron indices, a history of recent medication change, or the absence of
detectable hepatic steatosis on cross-sectional imaging. Also,
the persistence of increased levels of aminotransferases after 3
to 6 months of lifestyle intervention with appropriate weight
loss and control of lipids and glucose levels may suggest
another diagnosis and dictate the need for liver biopsy.

Staging

Liver biopsy is the only investigation that can differentiate
NASH from simple steatosis as well as stage the extent of ﬁbrosis. Imaging studies such as ultrasonography, CT, and MRI are
not able to distinguish between steatosis and NASH, nor are
they able to stage the degree of hepatic ﬁbrosis. Recently, measuring liver stiffness with ultrasound- or magnetic resonancebased elastography has been proposed as potentially useful for
quantifying liver ﬁbrosis in patients with a wide range of
chronic liver disease; however, further evaluation of these techniques is needed in patients with NAFLD. Obesity and abdominal wall thickness can limit the effectiveness of ultrasound-based
elastography because the depth of penetration is limited.
The potential beneﬁts of liver biopsy must be weighed
against the small risk of complications, including pain, bleeding, and death. Several clinical and laboratory features are

364

Section VI Liver

recognized in association with NASH or advanced ﬁbrosis (or
both) in patients with NAFLD, including older age, presence
of diabetes, higher BMI, higher AST/ALT ratio, and low albumin level and platelet count.
Advanced ﬁbrosis in patients with NAFLD has been associated with levels of serum markers of ﬁbrogenesis, including
hyaluronic acid, propeptide of type III collagen, and tissue
inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase-1. These serum markers
have been combined in a numerical score named the Enhanced
Liver Fibrosis panel to predict the presence and severity of
liver ﬁbrosis in NAFLD. Similarly, the ﬁbrotest, which has
been studied extensively in viral hepatitis to predict the
severity of ﬁbrosis, has been evaluated in NAFLD. In addition,
caspase-3–generated cytokeratin-18 fragments, a marker of
apoptosis measured in plasma, has been evaluated in distinguishing between simple steatosis and NASH. Although all
these scores based on laboratory markers aid in making the
decision about who should have biopsy, additional validation
is required before the markers can be used routinely in clinical
practice.

Prognosis

Knowledge of the histologic subtype of NAFLD and the stage
of ﬁbrosis is useful in determining prognosis and may alter
clinical management. The natural history of uncomplicated
hepatic steatosis is relatively benign; follow-up of 342 patients
for over 15 years showed progression to cirrhosis and liverrelated mortality in less than 1% of patients. In contrast,
NASH may progress to cirrhosis in up to 11% of patients, and
about 7% of NASH patients die from liver-related complications within 15 years after diagnosis. Therefore, the diagnosis
of NASH, particularly when associated with increased ﬁbrosis,
may prompt a more aggressive therapeutic approach toward
metabolic risk factors and participation of patients in clinical
trials of novel agents, if available. The presence of advanced
ﬁbrosis or cirrhosis should initiate screening for hepatocellular carcinoma and esophageal varices, with closer monitoring
for disease-related complications.

Prevention

No studies have been aimed at preventing the development of
NAFLD. Achieving and maintaining appropriate weight control would be expected to prevent the development of metabolic syndrome, and thus NAFLD, in many people. The
treatment of established glucose and lipid abnormalities may
reduce the likelihood of NAFLD or NASH, but no data exist
that speciﬁcally validate this. However, data from the diabetes
prevention program in the United States demonstrated that
both lifestyle intervention and the insulin-sensitizing drug
metformin signiﬁcantly decreased the development of metabolic syndrome, which, intuitively, may prevent the development of NAFLD.

Treatment

Weight loss, particularly if gradual, may lead to improvement
in the histologic features of the liver in NAFLD. However, the
rate and degree of weight loss required for normalization of the
histologic features have not been established clearly. Total starvation or very low calorie diets may cause worsening of the
histologic features and, thus, should be avoided. Rapid weight
loss also can lead to worsening liver disease; thus, a slow progressive weight loss is advocated. Weight loss as little as 5% of
baseline has been shown to improve or normalize ALT levels in
NASH, and a 7% to 10% weight reduction produced histologic
improvement. Studies have demonstrated that a rigorous lifestyle modiﬁcation program is necessary for patients to achieve
successful weight loss. These modiﬁcations include the following: 1) dietary restrictions, depending on the baseline weight
(1,000–1,200 kcal/day if baseline weight is <200 lb or 1,200–
1,500 kcal/day if baseline weight is >200 lb) and a daily fat gram
goal of 25% of caloric requirements. 2) Physical activity (goal
of 10,000 steps daily and 200 min/week of moderate to intense
activity). 3) Weekly group sessions for behavioral modiﬁcations. With rigorous programs, which usually are accomplished
through the work of a multidisciplinary team, successful weight
loss and histologic improvement are possible.
Weight loss agents such as orlistat and sibutramine produce only modest weight loss (generally 3–5 kg more than placebo) at the expense of adverse effects that include, for orlistat,
diarrhea, gastrointestinal pain, and vitamin deﬁciencies and,
for sibutramine, hypertension and drug interactions.
Rimonabant (a cannabinoid receptor-1 antagonist) produced
clinically meaningful weight loss and improvement in metabolic syndrome measures, but it has been withdrawn from the
market because of its psychiatric side effect.
Bariatric surgery has become one of the most common surgical procedures performed in the United States. Several surgical procedures are available to reduce the gastric reservoir
(restrictive procedures) and to reduce intestinal absorption of
nutrients (malabsorptive procedures). Because weight loss
following these procedures can be extreme and rapid, careful
monitoring is required. Several studies have demonstrated
improvement in metabolic syndrome measures and improvement in or resolution of steatosis. The severity of inﬂammation and ﬁbrosis seen in liver biopsy specimens often improves
5 years after bariatric surgery, but both inﬂammation and
ﬁbrosis worsen in some patients. For medically complicated
obesity, bariatric surgery should be considered.
Pharmacologic Treatment

Because achieving and maintaining appropriate weight control is difﬁcult for most obese patients, the use of medications
to directly reduce the severity of liver damage independent of
weight loss is an attractive alternative. Medical management
of metabolic syndrome is important when these parameters
exist. Pharmacologic therapy also may beneﬁt patients who
do not have metabolic syndrome (Table 33.4). Until recently,

the results of only pilot studies that evaluated insulin-sensitizer medications, antioxidants, lipid-lowering medications,
and some hepatoprotective medications suggested that these
medications may be of potential beneﬁt. Most of these studies
were uncontrolled, open-label studies that lasted 1 year or less,
and only a few evaluated the effect of treatment on the histologic features of the liver. More data are available now for oral
hypoglycemics, vitamin E, and betaine, and they validate the
ﬁndings of some of the pilot studies.
A collaboration of investigators, the NASH Clinical
Research Network, has demonstrated histologic beneﬁt with
vitamin E (800 IU/day) or pioglitazone (30 mg once daily)
therapy over placebo for nondiabetic patients who have NASH.
This study, with approximately 80 patients in each treatment
group followed for more than 2 years, demonstrated improvement in the serum levels of aminotransferases and biopsy evidence of improved steatosis and inﬂammation scores in both
treatment arms compared with placebo. Improvement was
more statistically signiﬁcant in the vitamin E arm. However,
no improvement was found in ﬁbrosis scores in any treatment
arm. Note that although improvement was greater in the treatment arms, only 36% to 47% of the patients had histologic
resolution of deﬁnite NASH. More important, 30% of patients
in the placebo arm had elements of histologic improvement
and 21% had histologic resolution of deﬁnite NASH, as seen
in biopsy specimens. The beneﬁcial effects of vitamin E and
pioglitazone in NASH should be weighed against the risk of
serious adverse events such as increased mortality associated
with vitamin E at a dose of 400 IU/day or higher and severe
heart failure associated with pioglitazone.
Rosiglitazone, administered for 12 months, led to modest
improvement in steatosis and ALT levels, compared with
placebo, but extending treatment for 2 more years was not
associated with additional laboratory or histologic beneﬁt.

365

Both pioglitazone and rosiglitazone induce notable weight
gain in patients receiving these medications, without subsequent weight loss, when this medical therapy is stopped.
This concern, in combination with the adverse events described
above, mandate close examination of the risk-to-beneﬁt ratio
for individual patients. Thus, the role of vitamin E and glitazones in treating NASH is unclear. Certainly, if a patient has
underlying diabetes, oral hypoglycemic agents (including
metformin or other agents) would be appropriate ﬁrst-line
agents for controlling diabetes.
Betaine, an antioxidant (methyl donor for the remethylation of homocysteine), was thought to be antisteatotic and
antiinﬂammatory (animal studies) and of possible beneﬁt for
the treatment of NASH (pilot study with humans). Recently, a
large randomized controlled trial found no histologic beneﬁt
for humans with NASH. In pilot studies of NASH patients,
ursodiol was thought to improve serum biochemistry measures, but a larger, randomized, placebo-controlled study
established that this agent had no histologic beneﬁt compared
with placebo, after 2 years of treatment. A randomized placebo controlled trial from Switzerland conﬁrmed these ﬁndings, but this trial also included an arm with the combination
of ursodiol and vitamin E and reported a modest histologic
beneﬁt (only for steatosis) for patients. Pilot studies involving
agents such as pentoxifylline and probucol have indicated that
these agents may have beneﬁt (and adverse effects), but further validation is required.
Initial studies on HMG CoA (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl
coenzyme A) reductase inhibitors (“statins”) suggested a possible decrease in the serum levels of aminotransferases, but a
recent small randomized controlled trial of only 12 months’
duration was unable to conﬁrm histologic beneﬁt. Fish oil has
antiinﬂammatory effects and is an effective agent for decreasing triglyceride levels. In animal studies of NASH, ﬁsh oil
(omega 3) has been associated with improved steatosis and
inﬂammation, and human studies have demonstrated biochemical improvement and radiologic improvements in steatosis but have not had adequate histologic assessment. Fish
oil is safe and well tolerated; thus, if hypertriglyceridemia is
present, ﬁsh oil may be the agent to select ﬁrst. Further study
is required to determine its direct effect on liver histology.
According to the American Heart Association guidelines, if a
patient has hypercholesterolemia, statins and other agents are
warranted to control hyperlipidemia.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and
angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) have been shown in
animal studies to be antiﬁbrogenic. Studies of hepatitis C
patients who have hypertension have shown beneﬁt in the
reduction of ﬁbrosis when patients received ACEI and ARB
therapy, compared with other antihypertensive agents. Thus
far, studies of NASH have shown that ACEIs and ARBs
improve serum biochemistry measures, insulin resistance, and
blood pressure. Few data are available about histologic
changes. If a patient with NASH is hypertensive and has
normal renal function and potassium levels, treatment with
ACEI or ARB agents would be an appropriate consideration.

366

Section VI Liver

A meta-analysis of all placebo-controlled trials in NASH
has reported that up to 30% of placebo patients may have
modest histologic improvement. Previously, it was determined
that up to 20% to 30% of liver biopsy specimens may be
understaged by sampling error. Thus, it cannot be overstated
that studies in NASH need to be placebo-controlled to assess
truly the beneﬁt of any agent studied.
For patients with cirrhotic-stage NAFLD and decompensated disease, liver transplantation is a potential life-extending
therapeutic alternative. However, some patients with cirrhotic-stage NAFLD have comorbid conditions that often may
limit their candidacy for liver transplantation.

Liver Disease and Pregnancya
J. Eileen Hay, MB, ChB

Because most pregnant women are young and healthy, liver
disease is uncommon in this patient population. Also, the
presence of liver disease must not be confused with some of
the physiologic changes of pregnancy that mimic features
commonly associated with liver dysfunction (Table 34.1),
including spider nevi and palmar erythema in 50% of pregnant women, increased serum level of alkaline phosphatase
from placental production, and decreased serum levels of bilirubin and hemoglobin with expanded blood volume. Increased
levels of bilirubin and transaminases, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, liver tenderness, or bruits do not occur in normal
pregnancy, and the clinical ﬁnding of jaundice is always abnormal. Abnormalities in liver enzyme levels occur in 3% to 5%
of pregnancies and jaundice in 0.1%, with a clinical signiﬁcance that is highly variable from a self-limiting to a rapidly
fatal condition.a
For diagnostic purposes, it is useful to divide liver diseases
in pregnant women into three main categories (Table 34.2):
1. Liver diseases occurring coincidentally in a pregnant
woman (viral hepatitis is the most common cause of
jaundice in pregnant patients)
2. Pregnancy occurring in a woman with chronic liver
disease
3. Liver diseases unique to pregnancy, including hyperemesis gravidarum, intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP), preeclampsia, HELLP (hemolysis, elevated

of pregnancy (AFLP)
These liver diseases, unique to pregnancy, can be considered
liver complications of pregnancy itself, and they have
a characteristic timing in relation to the trimesters of pregnancy. Hepatitis E and herpes hepatitis, although not related
etiologically to pregnancy, characteristically produce a fulminant and often deadly disease in the third trimester of pregnancy. Recent data suggest that most liver disease in pregnancy
is pregnancy-related and incidental and chronic liver diseases
are uncommon.

Diagnostic Strategy in Pregnant Patients

Optimal management of pregnant patients who have abnormal liver test results or jaundice requires accurate and
often rapid diagnosis. The clinical presentation and trimester
of pregnancy are diagnostically important (Table 34.2).

Answers to the following questions help formulate a rational
approach to these patients:
1. Are there any features of underlying chronic liver disease (including liver transplantation) or risk factors for
viral disease?
2. Is the presentation compatible with acute viral hepatitis?
3. Are there any features to suggest biliary disease?
4. Is there any history of drugs or toxins?
5. Are there any features of Budd-Chiari syndrome?
6. Is there any evidence or risk factors for sepsis?
7. Does the presentation ﬁt one of the liver diseases unique
to pregnancy?
Clinical features and laboratory testing allow a diagnosis in
most patients, but for some patients, imaging of the liver,
endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), or
liver biopsy is necessary. Ultrasonography of the liver and
abdomen is safe during all three trimesters of pregnancy and is
helpful in the evaluation of biliary tract disease, patency of
hepatic and portal veins, AFLP, hematomas, and rupture. To
conﬁrm the diagnosis of choledocholithiasis, ERCP can be
performed safely in pregnant women. Radiation exposure for
ﬂuoroscopy is well below the fetal safety level. Midazolam,
meperidine, and glucagon can be given safely. If indicated,
sphincterotomy and stone extraction should be performed at
the same time. Hepatic venography or magnetic resonance
imaging is necessary to conﬁrm the diagnosis of Budd-Chiari
syndrome in patients who have clinical and ultrasonographic
features compatible with the syndrome.

Liver Diseases Occurring Coincidentally in
Pregnant Patients
Viral Hepatitis

Jaundice in pregnancy may be due to any of the many causes
of jaundice in nonpregnant patients. Viral hepatitis (due to
hepatitis A, B, C, D, or E virus; cytomegalovirus; or EpsteinBarr virus) accounts for 40% of cases of jaundice in pregnant
women in the United States. Hepatitis A, B, and C have the
same frequency in the pregnant and nonpregnant populations
and during each of the three trimesters of pregnancy. Acute
hepatitis A occurs in 1 per 1,000 pregnant women and acute
hepatitis B in 2 per 1,000; hepatitis D is rare. Hepatitis E is
extremely rare in the United States but is endemic to large
areas of Asia, Africa, and Central America, where, in the third
trimester of pregnancy, it becomes fulminant, with a high
mortality rate that probably is inﬂuenced by malnutrition. In
India, 25% of women with acute liver failure are pregnant, and
in almost all of them, liver failure is due to acute viral hepatitis. Herpes simplex hepatitis is rare.
Apart from herpes simplex, the clinical and serologic course
of acute hepatitis in pregnant women is the same as in nonpregnant patients, and the hepatitis does not appear to affect
the pregnant state adversely. Even though herpes simplex hepatitis is rare, it must be diagnosed because speciﬁc therapy is
life-saving. In pregnant women, it typically occurs as a primary
infection in the third trimester and has systemic features with
a prodrome and fever, diffuse vesicular rash and leukopenia,
vulvar or oropharyngeal vesicular lesions, and coagulopathy.
These patients usually are anicteric even with liver failure.
Serologic testing for hepatitis A, B, and C viruses, EpsteinBarr virus, and cytomegalovirus should be performed in all
cases of acute jaundice in pregnancy. Antibody to hepatitis E
virus should be assayed if the patient is from, or has been a
recent traveler to, an endemic area. Testing for hepatitis C
virus RNA in the absence of antibody to hepatitis C virus has
been positive in several pregnant patients who subsequently
developed hepatitis C. Serologic testing, liver biopsy, and culture may be necessary to diagnose herpes simplex hepatitis.
Management of patients who have acute viral hepatitis is
supportive except for herpes simplex infection in which
prompt therapy with acyclovir or vidarabine is life-saving and
without which 50% of mothers will die. Acute or chronic viral
hepatitis is not an indication for the termination of pregnancy,
except in the case of a herpes infection that does not respond
to antiviral therapy. Congenital fetal malformations occur
only with early cytomegalovirus infection. Viral hepatitis is
not an indication for cesarean section, and breastfeeding
should not be discouraged.
For patients with chronic hepatitis B who receive antiviral
therapy, this therapy should be replaced with agents that are
safe to use in pregnancy (eg, lamivudine and tenofovir).
Interferon therapy is contraindicated in pregnancy.
Perinatal transmission of hepatitis B is highest in mothers
with acute hepatitis, especially with hepatitis B e antigen

34 Liver Disease and Pregnancy

(HBeAg)-positivity in the third trimester (50%–80%), lower
in mothers with hepatitis B e antibodies (25%), and lowest in
carriers (5%). From 80% to 90% of these babies become
chronic carriers. Transmission of hepatitis B is not transplacental but occurs at delivery and is preventable in more than
95% of cases by passive-active immunoprophylaxis of the
babies at birth (Table 34.3). Babies at risk for vertical transmission despite immunoprophylaxis are those whose mothers
have high levels of viremia (>8 log10 IU/mL). Treatment with
lamivudine in the last weeks of pregnancy can reduce transmission risk and appears to be safe. Breastfeeding is not contraindicated even if the mother has active hepatitis B. Vertical
transmission of hepatitis A and D is rare. The frequency of
mother-to-infant transmission of hepatitis C is 1% to 5%,
with maternal risk factors being coinfection with human
immunodeﬁciency virus, history of intravenous drug abuse,
and maternal viremia of more than 106 copies/mL.
Transmission is not affected by mode of delivery or breastfeeding. Newborns of mothers with hepatitis A in the third
trimester should be given passive immunoprophylaxis with
immunoglobulin within 48 hours after birth. The beneﬁts of
immunoglobulin for babies of mothers seropositive for hepatitis C virus are unknown, and there is no effective therapy for
preventing hepatitis C.
Gallstones and Biliary Disease

Increased lithogenicity of bile and biliary stasis during pregnancy predispose pregnant women to enhanced formation of
biliary sludge and stones. Despite their prevalence, symptomatic gallstones occur in only 0.1% to 0.3% of pregnancies and
symptoms usually develop after multiple pregnancies rather
than during gestation. The common clinical presentations are
biliary colic (5% of cases of jaundice in pregnancy), gallstone
pancreatitis (50% of women younger than 30 years with pancreatitis are pregnant), and, least common, acute cholecystitis.
The clinical features of biliary disease and pancreatitis are
the same as in nonpregnant patients, can occur at any time of
gestation, and may recur during pregnancy.
Intractable biliary colic, severe acute cholecystitis not
responding to conservative measures, and acute gallstone pancreatitis are indications for immediate cholecystectomy despite

the pregnant state. For acute biliary colic or acute cholecystitis, conservative therapy with bed rest, intravenous ﬂuids, and
antibiotics is instituted initially and is successful in more than
80% of patients, with no fetal or maternal mortality. However,
because symptoms recur during pregnancy in 50% of patients,
cholecystectomy is indicated for all patients with symptoms in
the second trimester. For these patients, the operation has very
little morbidity or mortality. Indeed, patients who undergo
cholecystectomy have better pregnancy outcomes than those
treated medically. Surgery is avoided in the ﬁrst 10 weeks of
pregnancy because of the risk of abortion with anesthesia and
the potential teratogenic effect of carbon dioxide. In the third
trimester, the uterus may impinge into the surgical ﬁeld; there
also is an increased risk of premature labor. Laparoscopic
cholecystectomy with added precaution for the pregnant state
is now the standard of care for these patients. An impacted
common bile duct stone and worsening gallstone pancreatitis
are indications to proceed to ERCP, sphincterotomy, and
stone extraction under antibiotic coverage.
Other Diseases

Budd-Chiari syndrome is rare and when it occurs in pregnancy, it is usually in the postpartum period. It has been
associated with antiphospholipid syndrome, thrombotic
thrombocytopenic purpura, preeclampsia, and septic abortion. Sepsis associated with pyelonephritis or abortion can
cause jaundice in early pregnancy. Severe gram-negative sepsis
with jaundice has been described in the third trimester.

Pregnant Patients With Chronic
Liver Disease

Many women with chronic viral or autoimmune hepatitis or
Wilson’s disease are of childbearing age. Chronic hepatitis B is
present in 0.5% to 1.5% of pregnancies and chronic hepatitis C
in 2.3% of pregnancies in some indigent populations. An
uncomplicated pregnancy with no disease ﬂare is expected in
patients with mild disease or disease in remission. In hepatitis C,
transaminase levels may actually decrease and hepatitis C viral
RNA levels increase during pregnancy, with the reverse occurring in the postpartum period. Patients with Dubin-Johnson
syndrome or benign recurrent intrahepatic cholestasis may
become more jaundiced during pregnancy, especially in the
second and third trimesters, but the only signiﬁcance of such
jaundice is the necessity to rule out other possible causes. Also,
symptomatic therapy for pruritus should be provided. Gilbert’s
syndrome and Rotor syndrome are unaffected by pregnancy.
Autoimmune disease is not expected to ﬂare in pregnancy
but is treated with increased doses of corticosteroids as necessary; azathioprine therapy in pregnancy has not been associated with increased fetal risk. Patients with Wilson’s disease
must be treated adequately before pregnancy and continue
receiving therapy throughout the pregnancy. Discontinuation
of therapy poses the risk of fulminant Wilson’s disease.

370

Section VI Liver

The best treatment is d-penicillamine, but, rarely, it has been
associated with congenital defects; trientine is a safe alternative for fetal health but of less proven efﬁcacy for the mother.
Most patients with advanced cirrhosis are amenorrheic and
infertile because of hypothalamopituitary dysfunction, but if
pregnancy occurs, maternal and fetal problems can be expected
to increase. Little is known about the optimal management of
pregnant patients with cirrhosis and portal hypertension in
the modern era of obstetrics. The main risk to the mother is
massive gastrointestinal tract bleeding (20%–25% of cases),
and women with known esophageal varices should be considered for endoscopic therapy, shunt surgery, or even liver
transplantation before pregnancy. Also, all patients, even if
they do not have varices before pregnancy, should undergo
upper endoscopy in the second trimester for assessment of
varices. If large varices are present, β-blocker therapy is initiated. Whether prophylactic endoscopic therapy for esophageal
varices in early pregnancy is beneﬁcial has not been tested.
Acute variceal bleeding is managed endoscopically in the same
way as for nonpregnant patients, although vasopressin is contraindicated. Little is known about the use of octreotide in
pregnancy. Ascites and hepatic encephalopathy are treated in
the standard way.
Vaginal deliveries with an assisted, short second stage are
preferable because abdominal surgery is avoided. However,
for patients known to have large varices, cesarean section is
recommended to avoid labor and, thus, prevent an increase in
portal pressure and the risk of variceal bleeding. Postpartum
hemorrhage and bacterial infections are reduced by correction
of coagulopathy and antibiotic prophylaxis.
A pregnant liver transplant recipient represents a unique
clinical situation requiring specialized care. With the success
of liver transplantation, more pregnancies are being reported
in liver recipients, and a carefully planned pregnancy in a
stable, healthy patient beyond the ﬁrst 2 years after orthotopic
liver transplantation can have excellent outcomes for the fetus,
mother, and graft. However, this is still a high-risk pregnancy,
with increased fetal prematurity and dysmaturity. Also, there
is some risk to the allograft from acute cellular rejection or
recurrent viral hepatitis. Consequently, it is imperative to
monitor immunosuppression closely and to adjust the calcineurin inhibitor doses as needed for the increased blood
volume in the second half of pregnancy. Liver function must
be monitored regularly, and all liver abnormalities, especially
acute cellular rejection, must be investigated and treated as
aggressively as in nonpregnant patients.

with preeclampsia. Second only to viral hepatitis as a cause of
jaundice in pregnant patients is ICP, a disease of severe pruritus, mild jaundice, and biochemical cholestasis limited to the
second half of pregnancy. In the United States, ICP occurs in
0.1% of pregnancies, with jaundice in about 20% of cases.
Hyperemesis gravidarum, with an incidence of 0.3%, is intractable nausea and vomiting that occur in the ﬁrst trimester;
high transaminase levels occur in 50% of patients and occasionally jaundice develops. ICP and hyperemesis are not associated with preeclampsia.
The preeclampsia-associated liver diseases are preeclampsia itself, HELLP syndrome, and AFLP. Preeclampsia occurs in
5% to 10% of pregnancies, but the liver is involved only in a
small proportion of patients. Preeclampsia is the most
common cause of liver tenderness and abnormal liver tests in
pregnant patients.
Hyperemesis Gravidarum

Hyperemesis gravidarum is intractable vomiting in the ﬁrst
trimester of pregnancy and is so severe that intravenous hydration is required. It occurs in 0.3% of pregnancies. Immunologic,
hormonal, and psychologic factors associated with pregnancy
may have an etiologic role. Risk factors include hyperthyroidism, psychiatric illness, molar pregnancy, preexisting diabetes
mellitus, and multiple pregnancies.
Clinical Features and Diagnosis

Vomiting must be severe and intractable to support the diagnosis of hyperemesis gravidarum. It occurs in the ﬁrst trimester of pregnancy, typically between 4 and 10 weeks of gestation,
and may be complicated by liver dysfunction and, occasionally, jaundice. High transaminase levels occur in 50% of
patients, up to 20-fold above the normal range. The diagnosis
is made on clinical grounds and rests on the presence of
intractable, dehydrating vomiting in the ﬁrst trimester.
Uncomplicated vomiting in pregnancy does not cause liver
dysfunction. When transaminase levels are high, serologic
testing for viral hepatitis should be performed. In the rare
patient who requires liver biopsy to exclude more serious disease, the histologic appearance of the liver is generally normal
but may show cholestasis with rare cell dropout. Despite high
transaminase levels, no inﬂammation or notable necrosis is
observed.
Management

Liver Diseases Unique to Pregnancy

Liver diseases unique to pregnancy have characteristic clinical
features and timing of onset in relation to pregnancy (Table 34.2).
Although still poorly understood, some interesting advances
have been made recently in understanding these pregnancyassociated diseases. These diseases belong to one of two
main categories depending on whether they are associated

Hospitalization is necessary for hydration and parenteral nutrition; otherwise, therapy is symptomatic with antiemetics.
Intrahepatic Cholestasis of Pregnancy

ICP is a speciﬁc liver disease unique to pregnancy; it is characterized by severe pruritus, mild jaundice, and biochemical
cholestasis that appear in the second half of pregnancy and

34 Liver Disease and Pregnancy

disappear after delivery. These features typically recur in subsequent pregnancies. ICP is second only to viral hepatitis as a
cause of jaundice in pregnant women.
Incidence and Cause

ICP is identiﬁed all over the world but has striking geographic,
ethnic, temporal, and seasonal variations. In the United States,
it occurs in 0.1% of pregnancies, with jaundice in 20% of cases,
but it has a much higher incidence in some other countries.
Recent advances have been made in understanding its cause,
which seems to be inﬂuenced by genetic, hormonal, and exogenous factors, perhaps of differing importance in different
women.
Familial cases and the high incidence in certain ethnic
groups (Araucanian Indians of Chile) have long suggested a
genetic predisposition to ICP. Pedigree analysis of family
members of a child with progressive familial intrahepatic
cholestasis has identiﬁed a mutation in the MDR3 (ABCB4)
gene associated with ICP. MDR3 is the transporter for phospholipids across the canalicular membrane. The association of
ICP with MDR3 mutations has been conﬁrmed by several
investigators, and MDR3 mutations may account for 15% of
cases of ICP. Mutations of other canalicular transporters, FIC1
and BSEP, have also been associated with ICP.
The pathogenesis clearly is related in some way to female
sex hormones: the temporal relationship to hormone levels in
late pregnancy, the increase in twin pregnancies, and the fact
that estrogens may cause cholestasis in nonpregnant women
who develop ICP in pregnancy. These and other observations
suggest that ICP is due to a genetically abnormal or exaggerated liver metabolic response to the physiologic increase in
estrogens during pregnancy. Impaired sulfation (an important
detoxiﬁcation pathway) has been identiﬁed in some patients
with ICP. Abnormalities in progesterone metabolism also
have been seen, some probably genetic, some exogenous.
Exogenous progesterone therapy administered in the third trimester of pregnancy increases the serum levels of bile acid and
alanine aminotransferase, and progesterone given to prevent
premature delivery can precipitate ICP in some women. The
role of exogenous factors in ICP is suggested by the fact that it
recurs in only 45% to 70% of pregnancies and with variable
intensity. Also, the clear seasonal variability of ICP suggests
modiﬁcation of the disease by exogenous factors. Dietary factors such as selenium deﬁciency have been implicated in some
studies from Chile.
Fetal complications in ICP are placental insufﬁciency, premature labor, and sudden fetal death. The pathogenesis of
these complications may be due to increased fetal levels of bile
acid. Normally, fetal bile acid is transported across the placental membrane to the maternal circulation, and high levels are
damaging to the fetus. Abnormal placental transport of bile
acid from the fetal to the maternal circulation, increased
maternal levels of bile acid, and immaturity of fetal transport
systems may all contribute to increased fetal levels of bile acid
in ICP.

371

Clinical Features and Diagnosis

The onset of pruritus at about 25 to 32 weeks of gestation in a
patient with no other signs of liver disease is strongly suggestive of ICP. This is especially true if the pruritus has occurred
in other pregnancies and then disappeared immediately after
delivery. In a ﬁrst pregnancy, diagnosis is generally made on
clinical grounds alone and can be conﬁrmed only with the
rapid postpartum disappearance of the pruritus.
The pruritus affects all parts of the body, is worse at night,
and may be so severe that the patient is suicidal. Excoriations
are usually obvious, and occasionally the cholestasis is complicated by diarrhea or steatorrhea. Jaundice occurs in 10% to
25% of patients and usually follows the onset of pruritus by
2 to 4 weeks. Jaundice without pruritus is rare. Occasionally,
the affected patient will be receiving progesterone therapy.
Variable levels of transaminases are seen in ICP, from mild
to 10- to 20-fold increases. The concentration of bilirubin
usually increases less than 5 mg/dL. The serum level of alkaline
phosphatase is less helpful in pregnancy. The most speciﬁc
and sensitive marker of ICP is the serum level of bile acid,
which is always increased in this condition, can be 100 times
above normal, and may correlate with fetal risk. Liver biopsy
is needed only if a more serious liver disease is strongly suspected clinically. In ICP, the liver has a near-normal appearance, with mild cholestasis and minimal or no hepatocellular
necrosis.
Management

With ICP, the main risk is to the fetus and includes premature
delivery (up to 60% of cases), perinatal death, and fetal distress. For the fetus, this is a high-risk pregnancy. Fetal monitoring for chronic placental insufﬁciency is essential but does
not prevent all fetal deaths. Acute anoxic injury can be prevented only by delivery as soon as the fetus is mature. A recent
Swedish population study of more than 45,000 pregnancies
with 693 cases of ICP (1.3%) showed that fetal complications
correlated with the increase in maternal levels of bile acid, and
premature delivery, asphyxial events, and meconium staining
occurred only when maternal bile acid levels were more than
40 mmol/L. Whether maternal therapy with ursodeoxycholic
acid (UDCA) will improve fetal outcome is not known.
Pruritus and liver dysfunction resolve immediately after
delivery, with no maternal mortality; however, some patients
are severely distressed, even suicidal, because of the pruritus.
Management strategies for the mother have focused on symptomatic relief. Withdrawal of exogenous progesterone has
produced remission of the pruritus in some patients before
delivery.
UDCA is the agent of choice for the treatment of ICP.
UDCA, 10 to 20 mg/kg per day, is successful in producing
relief from pruritus, with parallel improvement in liver test
results, and it has no adverse maternal or fetal effects. In one
study, fetal outcome was improved, with fewer premature
births. High-dose UDCA, 1.5 to 2.0 g/day, has been shown to

372

Section VI Liver

relieve pruritus in most cases, to decrease abnormal maternal
levels of bile acid, and to be completely safe for the fetus.
Moreover, babies born to these mothers had almost normal
bile acid levels, as compared with those of untreated mothers.
In randomized controlled trials, UDCA has been shown to be
more effective and safer than cholestyramine, more effective
than dexamethasone (although the latter has the advantage of
promoting fetal lung maturity), and more effective than
S-adenosyl-l-methionine. Epomediol and silymarin have produced symptomatic but not biochemical relief in a few
patients.
ICP recurs in 45% to 70% of subsequent pregnancies, and
it occurs occasionally in nonpregnant women who take oral
contraceptives. Patients with ICP are subsequently at higher
risk than the general population for the development of gallstones and cholecystitis, nonalcoholic pancreatitis, nonalcoholic cirrhosis, and hepatitis C. Some rare familial cases of
apparent ICP have persisted postpartum, with progression to
subsequent ﬁbrosis and cirrhosis.
Preeclampsia

Preeclampsia-associated liver diseases include preeclampsia
itself, HELLP syndrome, and AFLP. Preeclampsia is the triad
of hypertension, edema, and proteinuria in the third trimester
of pregnancy. It occurs in 5% to 10% of pregnancies, but the
liver is involved in only a small proportion of patients. It is the
most common cause of liver tenderness and abnormal liver
test results in pregnant patients. The cause of preeclampsia
appears to involve defective placentation that leads to generalized endothelial dysfunction.
Clinical Features

Patients with preeclampsia may present with right upper
abdominal pain, jaundice, and a tender, normal-size liver.
Transaminase levels vary from mild to 10- to 20-fold increases.
The bilirubin concentration is usually less than 5 mg/dL.
Involvement of the liver always indicates severe preeclampsia.
Management

No speciﬁc therapy is needed for the liver involvement of
preeclampsia, and its only importance is that it indicates severe
disease and the need for immediate delivery to avoid eclampsia and liver rupture or necrosis. HELLP syndrome and AFLP
may complicate preeclampsia.
HELLP Syndrome

Severe preeclampsia is complicated in 2% to 12% of cases
(0.2%–0.6% of all pregnancies) by hemolysis, elevated liver
tests, and low platelet count: HELLP syndrome. Although this
syndrome has been recognized for more than 50 years, its
diagnosis, management, and pregnancy outcome are still matters of controversy.

Clinical Features and Diagnosis

No diagnostic clinical features differentiate HELLP syndrome
from preeclampsia. Most patients with HELLP syndrome
present with epigastric or right upper quadrant pain (65%–90%
of patients), nausea and vomiting (35%–50%), a “ﬂulike” illness (90%), and headache (30%). They usually have edema
and weight gain (60% of patients), right upper quadrant tenderness (80%), and hypertension (80%); jaundice is uncommon (5%). Some patients have no obvious preeclampsia. Most
patients (71%) present between 27 and 36 weeks of gestation,
but it can be earlier or up to 48 hours after delivery. HELLP
syndrome is more common in multiparous and older
patients.
With the presence of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia,
the characteristic histologic ﬁnding in both HELLP syndrome
and preeclampsia is periportal hemorrhage and ﬁbrin deposition. Periportal hepatocytes are necrotic, and thrombi may
form in small portal arterioles. Severe disease may have diffuse
or multiple areas of infarction; hemorrhage dissects through
the portal connective tissue initially from zone 1, then more
diffusely to involve the whole lobule, leading to large hematomas, capsular tears, and intraperitoneal bleeding. Liver biopsy
is rarely needed for diagnosis.
The diagnosis of HELLP syndrome must be established
quickly because of the maternal and fetal risk and the necessity
for immediate delivery. Diagnosis requires the presence of all
three criteria: 1) hemolysis with an abnormal blood smear,
increased lactate dehydrogenase level (>600 U/L), and increase
in indirect bilirubin level; 2) aspartate aminotransferase level
more than 70 U/L; and 3) a platelet count less than 100,000/
mm3 (<100×109/L) and, in severe cases, less than 50,000/mm3
(<50×109/L). These diagnostic criteria, however, are not
applied consistently. Prothrombin time, activated partial
thromboplastin time, and ﬁbrinogen levels are usually normal,
with no increase in ﬁbrin-split products, but occasionally
disseminated intravascular coagulation may be present.
The increase in transaminase levels can vary from mild to
10- to 20-fold, and the bilirubin concentration is usually
less than 5 mg/dL. Computed tomography (limited views) is
indicated in patients with HELLP syndrome to detect liver
rupture, subcapsular hematomas, intraparenchymal hemorrhage, or infarction (Fig. 34.1); these abnormalities may correlate with the decrease in platelet count but not with liver test
abnormalities.
Management

The ﬁrst priority in the management of patients with HELLP
syndrome is antepartum stabilization of the mother, with
treatment of hypertension and disseminated intravascular
coagulation and seizure prophylaxis. If possible, the patient
should be transferred to a tertiary referral center and computed
tomography of the abdomen (limited views) performed.
Delivery is the only deﬁnitive therapy. If the patient
is beyond 34 weeks of gestation or has multiorgan failure,

34 Liver Disease and Pregnancy

woman with severe HELLP syndrome at 39 weeks’ gestation. A large

lobe has a heterogeneous, hypodense appearance because of
widespread necrosis, with “sparing” of the areas of the left lobe
(compare perfusion with the normal spleen).

disseminated intravascular coagulation, kidney failure, abruptio placentae, or fetal distress, immediate delivery should be
performed, probably by cesarean section, but well-established
labor should be allowed to proceed if there are no obstetric
complications or disseminated intravascular coagulation.
Many patients (40%–50%) require cesarean section, especially
primigravida remote from term in whom the cervix is unfavorable. Half of the patients will require blood or blood
products to correct hypovolemia, anemia, or coagulopathy.
Management remote from term is more controversial, especially if the fetal lung is immature and the maternal condition
is stable and mild. A National Institutes of Health Consensus
Development Panel has suggested that perinatal outcome at
less than 34 weeks of gestation is better when corticosteroids
(betamethasone or dexamethasone, which cross the placenta)
are administered for 24 to 48 hours, with delivery thereafter.
The main beneﬁt of this therapy is fetal lung maturity, but in
some cases it also improves the maternal platelet count. Some
advocate giving dexamethasone to all women with HELLP
syndrome, starting treatment before delivery but completing
it postpartum, with no delay in delivery, and corticosteroids
may aid maternal stability during the transfer time to a tertiary
referral center. With longer conservative therapy, the condition of most women with HELLP syndrome will deteriorate in
1 to 10 days after diagnosis, with a high risk of fetal loss.
In most patients, HELLP syndrome resolves rapidly and
early after delivery and the platelet count normalizes by 5 days,
but some have persisting thrombocytopenia, hemolysis, and
progressive increase in bilirubin and creatinine levels. The
persistence of signs for more than 72 hours, without improvement or the development of life-threatening complications,
is usually an indication for plasmapheresis. Many different
treatment modalities have been used, including plasma
volume expansion, antithrombotic agents, corticosteroids,

373

plasmapheresis, plasma exchange with fresh frozen plasma,
and dialysis, but no clinical trials have been conducted. Serious
maternal complications are common, including disseminated
intravascular coagulation (20% of patients), abruptio placentae (16%), acute kidney failure (8%), pulmonary edema (8%),
acute respiratory distress syndrome (1%), severe ascites (8%),
and liver failure (2%). Maternal mortality rates range from 1%
to 25%. Once delivered, most babies do well.
Serious maternal complications are common in HELLP
syndrome: disseminated intravascular coagulation, abruptio
placentae, kidney failure, eclampsia, pulmonary edema, severe
ascites, liver failure, and wound hematomas. Generally, hepatic
hemorrhage without rupture is managed conservatively in
hemodynamically stable patients, but patients need close
hemodynamic monitoring in an intensive care unit, correction of coagulopathy, immediate availability of large-volume
transfusion of blood and blood products, immediate intervention for rupture, and follow-up diagnostic computed tomographic studies as needed. Exogenous trauma, including
abdominal palpation, convulsions, emesis, and unnecessary
transportation must be avoided.
Liver rupture is a rare, life-threatening complication of
HELLP syndrome. It usually is preceded by an intraparenchymal hemorrhage that progresses to a contained subcapsular
hematoma in the right lobe. The capsule then ruptures, with
hemorrhage into the peritoneum. Survival depends on rapid
and aggressive medical management and immediate surgery,
although the best surgical management is still debated. The
options include evacuation of the hematoma with packing
and drainage, ligation of the hepatic artery, partial hepatectomy, direct pressure, packing or hemostatic wrapping,
application of topical hemostatic agents, oversewing of the
laceration, and angiographic embolization. Preoperatively,
aggressive supportive management of hypovolemia, thrombocytopenia, and coagulopathy is essential. Maternal mortality
from liver rupture is high at 50%, and perinatal mortality rates
are 10% to 60%, mostly from placental rupture, intrauterine
asphyxia, or prematurity.
The risk of recurrence of HELLP syndrome in subsequent
pregnancies is difﬁcult to assess from the data available; the
reported incidence is 4% to 25%. Subsequent deliveries by
these patients have a signiﬁcantly increased risk of preeclampsia, preterm delivery, intrauterine growth retardation, and
abruptio placentae.
Acute Fatty Liver of Pregnancy

AFLP is a sudden catastrophic illness that occurs almost exclusively in the third trimester and in which microvesicular fatty
inﬁltration results in encephalopathy and liver failure.
Incidence and Cause

The cause of AFLP may involve abnormalities in intramitochondrial fatty acid oxidation. Mitochondrial trifunctional
protein and its α-subunit, long-chain 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA

374

Section VI Liver

dehydrogenase (LCHAD), are two enzymes essential for the
β-oxidation of fatty acids in liver mitochondria. Autosomally
inherited genetic mutations of these two enzymes are associated most closely with AFLP, especially the G1548C mutation
of LCHAD. The mothers of babies with defects in fatty acid
oxidation and mothers within families with known defects in
fatty acid oxidation have a high incidence (62% in one series)
of maternal liver disease, either AFLP or HELLP syndrome.
LCHAD deﬁciency has been identiﬁed in 20% of babies of
mothers with AFLP but not in babies of mothers with HELLP
syndrome. It has been speculated that maternal heterozygosity
for LCHAD deﬁciency decreases the maternal capacity to oxidize long-chain fatty acids in both the liver and the placenta.
This, together with the metabolic stress of pregnancy and fetal
homozygosity for LCHAD deﬁciency, causes potentially hepatotoxic metabolites of LCHAD to accumulate in the maternal
circulation. Perhaps external factors exacerbate this situation.
There are reports of maternal liver disease associated with
defects of other enzymes involved in fatty acid oxidation, but
the role of these other enzymes in causing AFLP is a matter of
controversy.

B

Clinical Features and Diagnosis

Unlike HELLP syndrome, 50% of patients with AFLP are nulliparous, with an increased incidence in twin pregnancies.
AFLP occurs almost exclusively in the third trimester, from
28 to 40 weeks, most commonly at 36 weeks. In a few patients,
the presentation is jaundice in the postpartum period. The
presentation can vary from asymptomatic to acute liver failure; most patients have jaundice. A typical patient has 1 to
2 weeks of anorexia, nausea, vomiting, and right upper quadrant pain and looks ill, with jaundice, hypertension, edema,
ascites, a small liver (it may be enlarged initially), and various
degrees of hepatic encephalopathy. Intrauterine death may
occur. About 50% of patients with AFLP have preeclampsia.
In AFLP, the serum level of aspartate aminotransferase can
vary from near normal to 1,000 U/L, usually about 300 U/L;
the bilirubin concentration is usually less than 5 mg/dL but
higher in severe or complicated disease. Other typical
abnormalities are normochromic, normocytic anemia; high
leukocyte count; normal-to-low platelet count; abnormal prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, and
ﬁbrinogen, with or without disseminated intravascular coagulation; metabolic acidosis; kidney dysfunction (often progressing to oliguric kidney failure); hypoglycemia; high ammonia
level; and often biochemical pancreatitis. Computed tomography is more sensitive than ultrasonography for detecting
AFLP. A deﬁnitive diagnosis of AFLP can be made only on the
basis of the typical histologic features found on liver biopsy. In
the clinical setting, a presumptive diagnosis of AFLP is usually
made and the baby is delivered as soon as possible. The histologic appearance of AFLP is microvesicular and, infrequently,
macrovesicular fatty inﬁltration, which is most prominent in
zone 3; this fat consists of free fatty acids. Also, there is lobular
disarray, with pleomorphism of hepatocytes and mild portal

inﬂammation with cholestasis, an appearance similar to that
of Reye’s syndrome and tetracycline and valproic acid toxicity
(Fig. 34.2). Although the histologic features usually are diagnostic of AFLP, occasionally, they cannot be differentiated
from those of viral hepatitis or preeclampsia.
For severely ill patients with liver failure in the third trimester, the differential diagnoses are AFLP, HELLP syndrome
(Table 34.4), thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, hemolyticuremic syndrome, and fulminant viral hepatitis.
Management

Early recognition of AFLP, with immediate termination of the
pregnancy and intensive supportive care, is essential for the
survival of both the mother and the fetus. Recovery before
delivery has not been reported. Although the inciting injury
ceases with delivery, the patient requires support until liver
function has time to recover. By 2 to 3 days after delivery,
the transaminase levels and encephalopathy improve, but
intensive supportive care is needed to manage the many

complications of liver failure until this recovery occurs.
Patients who are critically ill at the time of presentation, who
develop complications (encephalopathy, hypoglycemia, coagulopathy, or bleeding [or a combination of these]), or whose
condition continues to deteriorate despite emergency delivery, should be transferred to a liver center.
Delivery is usually by cesarean section, but the necessity for
this has not been tested in randomized trials. Rapid controlled
vaginal delivery with fetal monitoring is probably safer if the
cervix is favorable and will decrease the incidence of major
intra-abdominal bleeding. It probably is best to maintain an
international normalized ratio of less than 1.5 and a platelet
count of more than 50,000/mm3 (>50×109/L) during and after
delivery and to provide antibiotic prophylaxis. With correction of the coagulopathy, epidural anesthesia is probably the
best choice and will allow a better ongoing assessment of the
patient’s level of consciousness.
Intensive supportive care is the same as for any patient with
acute liver failure. Plasmapheresis has been used in some cases,
but its beneﬁt is unproven. Corticosteroids are ineffective.
Although liver function starts to improve within 3 days after
delivery, the disease then enters a cholestatic phase, with
increasing levels of bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase.
Depending on the severity and complications, recovery can
occur in days or be delayed for months. It is complete when
the patient has no signs of chronic liver disease. With advances
in supportive management of these patients, including early

375

delivery, the maternal mortality rate is currently 10% to 18%
and the fetal mortality rate is 9% to 23%. Infectious and bleeding complications are the most life-threatening conditions.
Liver transplantation has a very limited role in AFLP because
of the great potential for recovery with delivery, but it should
be considered for patients whose clinical course continues to
deteriorate with advancing acute liver failure after the ﬁrst 1 or
2 days postpartum without signs of liver regeneration.
Many patients do not become pregnant again after AFLP,
either by choice, because of the devastating effect of the illness,
or by necessity, because of the hysterectomy to control postpartum bleeding. Women who are carriers of the LCHAD
mutation have an increased risk of the recurrence of AFLP in
20% to 70% of pregnancies. All babies of mothers with AFLP
are tested for defects of fatty acid oxidation because presymptomatic diagnosis and appropriate early management reduces
morbidity and mortality in these babies. More extensive neonatal screening for defects of fatty acid oxidation is advocated
by some. For mothers without identiﬁable abnormalities of
fatty acid oxidation, AFLP does not tend to recur in subsequent pregnancies, although rare cases have been reported.

Liver Transplantation
J. Eileen Hay, MB, ChB

Orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) is highly effective for
patients with liver failure, restoring normal health and, hopefully, a normal lifestyle. Patient survival is excellent; nationally, the survival rate is 86% at 1 year after OLT and 70% at
5 years. However, the demand for donor organs greatly exceeds
supply. In the United States in 2009, about 5,000 deceased
donor organs and only 200 living donor organs were available;
currently, about 16,000 patients are on the liver transplant
list. Patient selection and organ allocation are two major
problems.

Indications for Orthotopic Liver
Transplantationa

Decompensated cirrhosis is the most common indication for
OLT (about 70% of cases) (Table 35.1). The most common
underlying liver disease that leads to OLT in the United States
is cirrhosis due to hepatitis C (41% of cases), with or without
hepatocellular carcinoma, followed by alcoholic cirrhosis
(14%), chronic cholestatic liver disease (primary biliary cirrhosis and primary sclerosing cholangitis) (14%), and cryptogenic (10%) (some cases of cryptogenic cirrhosis may be
due to nonalcoholic fatty liver disease), with all other causes
of cirrhosis being less common. This distribution of causes
of liver disease that leads to OLT will likely change over
the next decades, with the number of cases of hepatitis C
decreasing but the number of cases of obesity-related liver disease increasing. The complications of cirrhosis that are
accepted indications for OLT are hepatocellular carcinoma,
hepatopulmonary syndrome, and portopulmonary hypertension. The following criteria (the Milan criteria) are used to

select tumors suitable for OLT, that is, those likely to be cured
by OLT: a single tumor 5 cm or less in any dimension or three
or fewer lesions each smaller than 3 cm. For all these tumors,
there can be no evidence of vascular invasion or extrahepatic
spread.
About 5% of all OLTs in the United States are performed
for acute medical emergencies, including acute liver failure,
fulminant Wilson’s disease, or early failure of a liver allograft
(primary nonfunction or hepatic artery thrombosis within
the ﬁrst postoperative week). Acute liver failure is an uncommon condition, with only about 3,000 cases annually in the
United States. The most frequent cause is acetaminophen
hepatotoxicity (almost half of all cases), followed by indeterminate causes (20%) and idiosyncratic drug reactions (14%).
Primary hyperoxaluria, familial amyloidosis, and cystic ﬁbrosis, diseases in which the metabolic defect is in the liver,
are also recognized indications for OLT in adults. For
children, several other metabolic diseases are indications for
OLT. Cholangiocarcinoma after intensive radiotherapy and
chemotherapy is a new accepted indication for transplant.

Section VI Liver

Several proposed indications for OLT remain the subject of
controversy, for example, metastatic neuroendocrine tumors
and polycystic liver disease. Occasionally, in some regions of
the United States, OLT is performed for these indications.

Allocation of Organs

In February 2002, the allocation system for deceased donor
livers in the United States was changed to a system based on
short-term mortality, that is, an organ is allocated to the patient
most likely to die in the next 3 months (Table 35.2). The most
urgent indication for OLT is acute liver failure, and these
patients are given the highest priority for urgent organ allocation (status 1 patients). Unlike status 1 patients, who should
be assigned an organ quickly after activation, patients with
chronic liver disease generally have a two-step process: listing
for OLT and allocation of a donor organ. If otherwise suitable
to be a transplant recipient, a patient with cirrhosis will be registered with the United Network of Organ Sharing (UNOS)
on the liver transplant waiting list; however, organ allocation
is prioritized for patients listed within each ABO blood group,
according to their 3-month expected mortality, as deﬁned by
the model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) system.
The MELD score is based on creatinine, bilirubin, and
international normalized ratio (INR) values and is calculated
according to the following formula:
MELD score
= 0.957 × Log e (creatinine mg/dL)
+ 0.378 × Log e (bilirubin mg/dL)
+ 1.120 × Log e (INR) + 0.643
The three biochemical variables are placed in a computer
program, and the MELD score is calculated (www.unos.org).

For MELD scores higher than 40, the expected 3-month mortality rate for patients is 80% without OLT; for scores of 20 to
29, the rate is 20% to 25%, and for scores less than 10, patients
have no excess short-term mortality.
Hepatocellular carcinoma is an accepted indication for
OLT for which mortality is not reﬂected by the MELD score.
A patient with hepatocellular carcinoma within Milan criteria
is assigned a MELD score to allow OLT in 3 to 12 months
(called a MELD exception). In the United States, hepatopulmonary syndrome, hyperoxaluria, familial amyloidosis,
cholangiocarcinoma, cystic ﬁbrosis, and portopulmonary
hypertension are the other MELD exceptions for adults. For
all these MELD exceptions, there are strict inclusion and
exclusion criteria (www.unos.org). Patients with these criteria
are assigned a MELD score of 22 (the exception is 28 assigned
to hyperoxaluria), with a 10% mortality equivalent increase
every 3 months.
The only ways for patients to be guaranteed consideration
for allocation of a deceased donor organ is to have status 1, a
calculated MELD score, or an assigned MELD score (MELD
exceptions). For controversial indications for OLT or for
patients who are more symptomatic than suggested by their
MELD score, transplant programs may appeal to their regional
review board to be given an assigned MELD score that will
allow early OLT. Different review boards have different philosophies about which patients will be considered for an
assigned MELD score; there are no national rules for these
review boards.
Despite the success of OLT, the procedure has some absolute and relative contraindications (Table 35.3). None of the
relative contraindications are absolute, and their weight may
vary in different transplant programs; however, added
together, they may preclude a patient from having OLT.

Beware of drug interactions with drugs affecting cytochrome P-450 enzyme system; drugs inhibiting the cytochrome P-450 system (eg, ﬂuconazole) increase the levels of
calcineurin inhibitors; drugs stimulating the cytochrome P-450 system (eg, phenytoin) decrease calcineurin inhibitor levels and thus increase the risk of rejection.

cyclosporine as the calcineurin inhibitor of choice in most
liver transplant programs. Frequently, corticosteroids with or
without mycophenolate mofetil are administered in the ﬁrst
postoperative weeks. Immunosuppression is tapered by
4 months, often to tacrolimus monotherapy, with lower
serum levels. Long-term calcineurin inhibitor monotherapy is
ideal, but if nephrotoxicity develops in response to the treatment, low-dose calcineurin inhibitor plus mycophenolate
mofetil or sirolimus may be used. Overall, the trend now is to
tailor immunosuppression to each patient, depending on the
time from OLT, rejection history, and adverse effects from
individual drugs.

Complications After Orthotopic Liver
Transplantation
Primary Nonfunction of the Liver Allograft

The most dire early complication is primary nonfunction of
the allograft. This starts immediately with the appearance of
clear bile or no output of bile, high aminotransferase levels,
and then an increase in bilirubin concentration. The main
identiﬁed risk factor is high fat content of the allograft. Grafts
may be biopsied to assess this before implantation. No therapy
is available for primary nonfunction, and the patient needs to
be reactivated as status 1 to receive a second graft.
Hepatic Artery Thrombosis

Another dreaded early complication of OLT is hepatic artery
thrombosis. This is most common in children, size-mismatched grafts, and living donor OLT. It usually occurs in the
ﬁrst week after OLT, but it can develop later. The clinical
manifestations may be subtle, and patients may be asymptomatic or have mild fever or increased aminotransferase levels.

In the majority of adults with hepatic artery thrombosis, the
grafts fail because of hepatic necrosis or ischemic cholangiopathy. When hepatic artery thrombosis occurs in the ﬁrst
7 days after OLT, the patient will be listed for retransplantation as status 1.
Cellular Rejection

Acute cellular rejection occurs in up to 50% of liver recipients
and usually is associated with mild-to-moderate biochemical
abnormalities and, occasionally, fever. Although the diagnosis
can be suspected by the timing in the early weeks after OLT,
deﬁnitive diagnosis requires histologic examination of the
liver, with the following ﬁndings: 1) portal inﬁltrates with activated lymphocytes and some eosinophils, 2) lymphocytic cholangitis, and 3) venous endotheliitis. Ninety percent of cases of
rejection occur in the ﬁrst 2 postoperative months. Most rejections are treated with intravenous corticosteroids, and 85% of
patients with rejection have a response to corticosteroids. Of
the cases of steroid-resistant rejection, 90% respond to intravenous antibody therapy with antithymocyte globulin. Acute
cellular rejection early after OLT generally has no effect on
long-term graft outcome, except for patients with hepatitis C,
and very few grafts are lost to chronic rejection.
Biliary Strictures

The biliary anastomosis, either duct-to-duct or biliary-enteric,
is the most common site of biliary strictures, which usually
form in the ﬁrst month. Most strictures respond to endoscopic
dilatation, with or without stents, but occasionally surgical
revision of the anastomosis is needed.
Nonanastomotic or ischemic-type biliary strictures may
form at any time, but the median time is about the eleventh
postoperative week. The most common identiﬁed cause is
hepatic artery thrombosis, either early or late. Other associations

380

Section VI Liver

are with ABO incompatibility, long warm (>90 minutes) or
cold (>12 hours) ischemia time, and donor grafts harvested
after cardiac death (DCD grafts). Some of these strictures can
be managed with endoscopic or percutaneous biliary stenting,
although ischemic-type biliary stricturing leads to death or
need for retransplantation in about 50% of cases.
Infections

A systemic fungal, viral, or bacterial infection develops in one
in ﬁve liver transplant recipients during the ﬁrst postoperative
month. Cytomegalovirus infection is the most common viral
infection. Its incidence peaks in the ﬁrst 3 to 5 postoperative
weeks, and it is rare after the ﬁrst year. Its presence is suggested by fever and leukopenia. Treatment is with intravenous
ganciclovir or oral valganciclovir. Candida infection is the
most common fungal infection, although opportunistic infections can also be seen with Aspergillus, Nocardia, Cryptococcus,
and Pneumocystis. Many transplant programs provide prophylaxis for Pneumocystis in the early postoperative months
when immunosuppression is at its highest level.
Late Complications

The main late complications after OLT are recurrent
disease, complications of immunosuppression, and de novo
malignancies.
When late allograft dysfunction occurs in a patient who is
well and receiving stable, therapeutic immunosuppression,
recurrent disease is the most likely diagnosis, especially if the
underlying cause of liver disease is hepatitis C. The diagnosis is
histologic, and liver biopsy is needed. The incidence and
potential severity of recurrent disease in an allograft is greatest
for hepatitis C. Recurrent hepatitis C may be treated with
pegylated interferon and ribavirin. Adverse effects are
common, especially anemia, and dose reductions are frequently necessary. Treatment with pegylated interferon and
ribavirin produces a sustained virologic response in about
30% of patients with recurrent hepatitis C after liver transplantation. Currently, recurrent hepatitis B is prevented in
more than 90% of patients by hepatitis B immunoglobulin
and antiviral therapy. However, most other liver diseases,
including primary biliary cirrhosis and primary sclerosing
cholangitis, autoimmune hepatitis, nonalcoholic fatty liver
disease, and hepatocellular carcinoma may recur.
Most OLT recipients have normal cardiac function, but
increasingly patients who are obese or have diabetes mellitus
or hypertension are undergoing OLT. In addition, even in
those with no pre-OLT risk factors for coronary artery disease,
treatment with immunosuppressive drugs may produce an
increase in hypertension, diabetes, kidney failure, dyslipidemia,
and obesity in a high percentage of patients (Table 35.5). This
leads to a proﬁle of high risk for cardiovascular diseases for

many OLT recipients, with cyclosporine having more metabolic effects than tacrolimus. OLT recipients must receive
adequate screening and treatment for these risk factors.
Liver transplant recipients have multiple potential risk factors for cancer: immunosuppression, viruses (hepatitis C
virus, hepatitis B virus, human papillomavirus, human herpes
virus 6, Epstein-Barr virus), alcohol use, and smoking.
Furthermore, many recipients are now older than 50 years or
even older than 60 years at the time of OLT and, thus, have the
increased cancer risk of aging. The effect of immunosuppression probably is related to the degree of immunosuppression
rather than to individual agents. The reported overall incidence of cancer varies depending on the series, from 2.9% to
14%; the reported cancer-related mortality rate is 0.6% to 8%.
Malignancies are an important cause of long-term mortality.
Malignancies that occur frequently in OLT recipients are
skin cancers, posttransplant lymphoproliferative disease, and
cervical, vulvar, and anal squamous cancers. The incidence of
colorectal cancer is increased only for recipients with primary
sclerosing cholangitis, likely related to ulcerative colitis.
Increasingly, data show notable mortality at 5 to 10 years after
OLT from upper aerodigestive cancers in recipients who continue to smoke and drink.

Expansion of the Donor Pool

Adult-to-adult living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) uses
the right lobe of the donor for implantation into the recipient.
For pediatric recipients, the left lobe may be used, depending
on size. The major advantages of LDLT over deceased donors
are availability of the organ and expansion of the donor pool.
LDLT produces more vascular and biliary problems but no
less rejection. The donor morbidity rate is 8% to 26%, and the
mortality rate is 0.4% (1/250). Other ways of expanding the
donor pool are the use of older donors (higher rate of primary
nonfunction), split livers (higher complication rate, labor-intensive, and disadvantage to primary recipient), marginal
donors (eg, fatty liver with increased risk of primary nonfunction), donation after cardiac death (increased risk of biliary
complications), and high-risk donors (high-risk lifestyle or
medical history).

postoperatively. He has no history of inﬂammatory bowel disease, and colonoscopic ﬁndings 1
year ago were negative. Physical examination
shows jaundice and mild muscle wasting.
Laboratory values include the following: hemoglobin 12.5 g/dL, leukocyte count 6.4×109/L, sedimentation rate 55 mm/1 hour, AST 30 U/L,
alkaline phosphatase 506 U/L, bilirubin 8.5 mg/
dL, CA19-9 <15 U/mL, prostate-speciﬁc antigen
0.5 ng/mL, and gamma globulin 3.0 mg/dL. CT
showed dilated bile and pancreatic ducts. Review
of the ERCP performed preoperatively is consistent with primary sclerosing cholangitis with
prominent distal bile duct stricture. Which of the

b. Simultaneous introduction of antiretroviral
therapy and pegylated interferon
c. Pegylated interferon and ribavirin
d. Antiretroviral therapy

Answers

VI.1. Answer a.
The radiologic features are most consistent with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. Although modest increases
in CA19-9 levels can be seen in cirrhosis without malignancy, this degree of increase, in conjunction with the
imaging features, is supportive of the diagnosis. Hepatocellular carcinoma is characterized by enhancement
in the arterial phase, with washout during the portal
venous phase. Cavernous hemangiomas are uncommon in cirrhosis and do not have these imaging characteristics. Focal nodular hyperplasia is rare in cirrhosis. A
macroregenerative nodule would rarely reach this size
(4.5 cm) and would not be associated with weight loss
and abdominal pain.
VI.2. Answer c.
The ultrasonographic and CT description are classic for
a cavernous hemangioma, which is a benign lesion that
requires no therapy unless symptomatic. The patient’s
left lower quadrant pain is unrelated to the cavernous
hemangioma. Cavernous hemangiomas are not a contraindication to oral contraceptive or estrogen use.
Biopsy can be performed safely but is not necessary
when the imaging features are characteristic.
VI.3. Answer a.
The above scenario describes a patient who presents
with simple liver cysts. Simple liver cysts usually do not
need to be treated. Surgery or percutaneous aspiration
and instillation of ethanol to ablate the cyst is indicated
only for large symptomatic cysts. Because ultrasonography showed features typical of simple liver cysts, CT is
not indicated. If thick-walled cysts with nodularity or
irregular septations were found, CT would be required
to rule out cystadenoma or, rarely, cystadenocarcinoma.
The use of oral contraceptives should be discontinued
by patients with hepatic adenomas, but not by those
with simple cysts.

VI.4. Answer b.
The best answer is hepatocellular carcinoma. A new
lesion that occurs in a cirrhotic liver and has features of
arterial enhancement and portal and venous phase
washout on cross-sectional contrast imaging meets the
criteria for noninvasive diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma. It should be noted that the overall performance
of alpha fetoprotein is low for the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma in the surveillance setting. Therefore, a low serum level of alpha fetoprotein does not
rule out the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma.
Typical radiologic features of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma include a hypodense lesion on noncontrast
imaging, often with a rounded, smooth, nodular
appearance. In the arterial phase, there is minimal
enhancement that progressively increases through to
the venous phase, often more prominent peripherally
than centrally. Similar to adenomas, focal nodular
hyperplasias typically show early arterial enhancement
with a rapid return to the intensity of the surrounding
liver; in addition, they often have a central scar. Imaging features of hepatocellular carcinoma can be sufﬁciently characteristic that biopsy is not necessary in
many cases. Liver metastasis from other primary cancer
should be suspected if nodules without the radiologic
features characteristic of hepatocellular carcinoma were
detected in a noncirrhotic liver.
VI.5. Answer d.
Transarterial chemoembolization is the best answer.
The patient has Barcelona Clinic for Liver Cancer
(BCLC) stage B hepatocellular carcinoma (nonresectable, nontransplantable), at which stage transarterial
chemoembolization is recommended. Surgical resection
is not appropriate because the patient has bilobar unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma. Moreover, a MELD
score of more than 8 is associated with poor outcome
after surgical resection of hepatocellular carcinoma.
393

394

Section VI Liver

Radiofrequency ablation is not recommended for large
(>3 cm) multinodular hepatocellular carcinoma. On
the basis of current recommendations of the American
Association for the Study of Liver Diseases, comfort
care is indicated when patients have terminal-stage
hepatocellular carcinoma, with a performance status
more than 2 or Child-Pugh class C liver dysfunction.
Transarterial chemoembolization has been shown to
improve the survival of patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. Although liver transplantation is
the most deﬁnitive treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma meeting the Milan criteria (one nodule up to
5 cm or two or three nodules up to 3 cm), the patient
is now beyond the Milan criteria.
VI.6. Answer d.
The above scenario describes a patient who presents with
a lesion suspicious for hepatocellular carcinoma. For the
nonhistologic diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma,
venous washout should be present either on dynamic CT
or MRI. Therefore, abdominal MRI is a reasonable next
step for the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma. A new
enhancing lesion seen on CT in patients with cirrhosis is
suspicious for, but not diagnostic of, hepatocellular carcinoma. Therefore, further work up with MRI is needed,
rather than short-term or regular follow-up. A deﬁnite
diagnosis should be made before treatment with radiofrequency ablation or liver transplantation.
VI.7. Answer d.
The AST value is usually greater than the ALT value in
alcoholic hepatitis. Answers a and b favor the alternate
diagnosis of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Methotrexate can also cause steatohepatitis. Mallory bodies do
not differentiate nonalcoholic steatohepatitis from
alcoholic steatohepatitis.
VI.8. Answer b.
The discriminant function is too low to qualify for steroid or pentoxifylline therapy. Active infection is a
contraindication to steroid therapy. N-acetylcysteine
has not been shown to be effective monotherapy for
alcoholic hepatitis.
VI.9. Answer a.
The answer that best explains why liver test results are
high is alcohol in combination with acetaminophen.
The other choices (b-d) would rarely account for
enzyme levels this high.
VI.10. Answer d.
This degree of alcohol consumption is considered a
contraindication to hepatitis C therapy. Treatment can
be considered after the patient remains abstinent from
alcohol. If cirrhosis is due to a combination of alcohol
and hepatitis C, the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma
is higher than if cirrhosis is due to either alcohol or

hepatitis C alone. Patients with alcoholism should be
advised to never drink alcohol again; resumption of
any kind of alcohol intake often leads to excessive
intake and more rapid liver deterioration. Liver
transplantation is not an option now but can be considered if the patient can demonstrate abstinence from
alcohol use.
VI.11. Answer c.
Patients with chronic portal vein thrombosis may be
asymptomatic. Complications include variceal bleeding and, rarely, bowel ischemia, especially if there is
progression of the thrombosis. Common causes of
portal vein thrombosis are cirrhosis, intra-abdominal
malignancy, and intra-abdominal infection. Patients
with portal vein thrombosis should be tested for hypercoagulable states as a ﬁrst step. MRI of the abdomen
and portal venography are not necessary because CT
provides enough information in this case. Liver biopsy
ﬁndings may be normal or show nodular regenerative
hyperplasia, but biopsy is not usually necessary if liver
tests are normal. Anticoagulation may be considered
but not before evaluation for hypercoagulable states.
VI.12. Answer e.
Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia is an autosomal
dominant condition characterized by diffuse telangiectasias. Characteristic liver abnormalities are intrahepatic vascular ﬁstulae and complications of transfusions
such as chronic viral hepatitis. Portopulmonary hypertension and hepatopulmonary syndrome are complications of cirrhosis; this patient does not have other
clinical evidence of cirrhosis. Patients with primary
biliary cirrhosis may have features of scleroderma,
but the family history and hepatic bruit would be
unusual for primary biliary cirrhosis. Primary portal
hypertension might cause dyspnea but does not result
in telangiectasias.
VI.13. Answer a.
By deﬁnition, venoocclusive disease develops within
3 weeks after bone marrow transplantation and is typically characterized by right upper quadrant pain, weight
gain due to ascites, and serum bilirubin levels higher
than 2 mg/dL. Underlying liver disease and preconditioning for bone marrow transplantation are predisposing factors. The histologic ﬁndings mimic those of
hepatic venous outﬂow obstruction, with hepatic congestion in the centrilobular areas (zone 3). No effective
therapy is available, although anticoagulation is often
administered. Unlike graft-versus-host disease, there is
no chronic form of hepatic venoocclusive disease.
VI.14. Answer e.
Budd-Chiari syndrome should be considered in young
patients who present with the sudden onset of ascites.
Mild-moderate liver test abnormalities are the norm,

Questions and Answers

although patients occasionally present with acute
hepatic failure. Imaging studies typically show ascites
and hepatomegaly. Doppler ultrasonography or contrast-enhanced CT or MRI is necessary to demonstrate
hepatic vein occlusion, and a hypercoagulable state will
be identiﬁed in most patients. Autoimmune hepatitis
and primary biliary cirrhosis do not typically present
with ascites unless liver disease is severe, but this patient
has only a modest increase in the levels of hepatocellular
enzymes and bilirubin. Liver injury from oral contraceptives is rare and typically presents with cholestasis
and without ascites. Acute portal vein thrombosis can
present with ascites but would not cause hepatomegaly.
VI.15. Answer c.
Repeat endoscopy is recommended in 3 years to screen
for varices. If liver function has deteriorated, endoscopy may be repeated in 2 years.
VI.16. Answer e.
Endoscopy should be repeated in 2 years. Endoscopy
may be repeated in 1 year if liver function deteriorates.
Small varices in patients who are Child-Pugh class C
may be treated with β-blockers.
VI.17. Answer e.
Antimicrobial prophylaxis should be administered for
patients with cirrhosis who are admitted with gastrointestinal tract bleeding, even if ascites is not present. For
patients with ascites, paracentesis should be performed
before antibiotics are administered. If quinolone resistance is suspected, ceftriaxone is administered intravenously at a dose of 1 g every 24 hours. Norﬂoxacin is
administered at a dose of 400 mg twice daily by mouth
for 7 days.
VI.18. Answer c.
The preferred option for preventing variceal rebleeding is a combination of variceal ligation and nadolol.
TIPS is used only if bleeding recurs in spite of both
nadolol and variceal ligation therapy. Surgical shunts
may also be an option for refractory variceal bleeding
but are rarely used in patients with cirrhosis, for which
TIPS is preferred.
VI.19. Answer e.
The initial therapy for bleeding due to severe portal
hypertensive gastropathy is iron replacement and a
nonselective β-blocker. Red blood cell transfusions are
done as required but would not be required for someone with mild anemia. Argon plasma coagulation is
more effective for gastric antral vascular ectasia than for
portal hypertensive gastropathy and would be tried only
if bleeding was refractory to nadolol and iron therapy.
VI.20. Answer d.
Large-volume paracentesis is indicated for tense ascites.
It is more effective and safer than diuretic therapy

395

alone, although sodium restriction and diuretic therapy need to be instituted immediately afterward.
Because the patient has tense ascites, diagnostic paracentesis alone is not adequate. TIPS is not ﬁrst-line
therapy in this case. Dietary sodium restriction alone
will not be effective for this patient.
VI.21. Answer d.
Chest tubes are avoided in hepatic hydrothorax because
it is unlikely they can be removed. All other measures
should be implemented as for ascites.
VI.22. Answer b.
Antibiotics plus albumin are more effective for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis than antibiotics alone. The
high creatinine level would preclude an increase in
diuretics at this time; in fact, diuretics should be withheld at this point. Oral antibiotics may be used to treat
spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in stable outpatients
but are not appropriate in this case. Increasing lactulose is advisable but is not as imperative as initiating
treatment for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.
VI.23. Answer b.
The plasma volume of this patient most likely has contracted because of diuretics and diarrhea and requires
volume resuscitation. Because he has only mild ascites,
large-volume paracentesis is not necessary. In addition,
removal of a large amount of ﬂuid may worsen renal
function. The patient should have screening for infection, but there is no need for empiric antibiotics at this
time. An increase in the dose of lactulose would worsen
the patient’s diarrhea and possibly his renal function.
Tolvaptan, an oral vasopressin receptor antagonist, can
be administered for severe hyponatremia but is very
expensive and should be used only for severe, symptomatic hyponatremia refractory to other measures.
VI.24. Answer e.
Rifaximin recently has been shown to be more effective than placebo in preventing episodes of encephalopathy in patients receiving lactulose. A higher dose of
lactulose is limited in this patient by diarrhea, which
can produce intravascular volume depletion and
worsen encephalopathy. A low protein diet can worsen
nutritional status in patients with cirrhosis and should
be used only in cases refractory to medical therapy.
Because the patient’s condition has improved with
treatment of encephalopathy, imaging of the head is
not necessary.
VI.25. Answer b.
Alkaline phosphatase is the most sensitive and speciﬁc
indicator of response to ursodiol therapy, and various
cutoff values have been used to indicate a response.
Improvement in aminotransferase levels can occur but
is less predictive of response than is alkaline phosphatase. Increases in bilirubin level and prothrombin

396

Section VI Liver

time indicate advanced disease and generally do not
improve with ursodiol therapy.
VI.26. Answer c.
Patients with cholestatic liver disease, particularly primary biliary cirrhosis, may have hyperlipidemia but do
not seem to have an increased risk of atherosclerosis.
Patients with both primary biliary cirrhosis and primary sclerosing cholangitis do develop osteoporosis
with an accelerated risk. Renal function is not disturbed, and patients may develop fat-soluble rather
than water-soluble vitamin deﬁciencies.
VI.27. Answer d.
Patients with known primary sclerosing cholangitis
and a suspected complication are best managed with
endoscopic retrograde cholangiography because of the
enhanced ability to distinguish between benign and
malignant strictures with histologic sampling as well as
to identify and treat intraductal stones.
VI.28. Answer b.
The antinuclear and anti-smooth muscle antibodies are
almost (95%) always present in these patients. Patients
respond to ursodiol therapy just as do patients with
antimitochondrial antibody–positive primary biliary
cirrhosis. Their histologic features are comparable, and
unless a true overlap syndrome is present, patients do
not develop changes suggestive of autoimmune hepatitis, nor do they require corticosteroid therapy.
VI.29. Answer b.
Prospective registry data from Spain and the United
States have identiﬁed amoxicillin-clavulanic acid as
the drug most commonly associated with idiosyncratic
drug-induced liver injury.
VI.30. Answer b.
The presence of jaundice following a hepatocellular
injury pattern from drug-induced liver injury is the definition of Hy’s rule. According to Hy’s rule, the probability of death from drug-induced liver injury is
estimated at 10%. The peak serum ALT level has not
been associated exclusively with a poor prognosis in the
absence of jaundice. There is no evidence that the class
of drug is linked with prognosis. Women rather than
men are at increased risk for acute hepatic failure or
need for liver transplantation (or both) in association
with drug-induced liver injury. Patients with cholestasis
due to drug-induced liver injury may require months
for liver tests to improve. However, the mortality risk
for this type of drug-induced liver injury is lower than
for cases involving a hepatocellular injury pattern.
VI.31. Answer e.
Hypersensitivity features in association with druginduced liver injury often include fever, rash, and

eosinophilia and recur with drug rechallenge. Among
the listed agents, the one most commonly associated
with hypersensitivity reactions is nevirapine. Valproic
acid is usually associated with microvesicular steatosis.
Few, if any, reports of hypersensitivity reaction are
known for ribavirin and tenofovir. N-acetylcysteine is
often used to treat acetaminophen toxicity.
VI.32. Answer d.
The clinical presentation of drug-induced autoimmune
hepatitis can be indistinguishable from de novo autoimmune hepatitis. Patients with either condition will have
similar aminotransferase levels, autoantibody titers,
gamma globulin levels, and histologic features, including interface hepatitis, at diagnosis. The risk for recurrent disease after the withdrawal of immunosuppressive
therapy is low (<10%) for patients with drug-induced
autoimmune hepatitis, in contrast to a nearly 75% risk
for patients with de novo autoimmune hepatitis.
VI.33. Answer e.
Several clinical risk factors have been identiﬁed in
association with drug-induced liver injury. These
include increasing age, female gender, and daily dose
of the suspected agent. Obesity and alcohol use,
although important cofactors in chronic liver injury,
have yet to be identiﬁed deﬁnitively as risk factors for
drug-induced liver injury. The presence of cirrhosis
does not appear to increase the risk for idiosyncratic
drug-induced liver injury.
VI.34. Answer d.
The clinical and histologic ﬁndings are consistent with
autoimmune hepatitis. About 50% of patients with
autoimmune hepatitis present with clinical acute hepatitis. With the compatible features and the patient’s
symptoms, treatment is indicated. Treatment options
for acute autoimmune hepatitis are either prednisone
alone (60 mg/day is recommended) or prednisone in
combination with azathioprine (30 mg and 50 mg,
respectively, are recommended). Azathioprine alone is
inadequate for the management of autoimmune hepatitis. Methylprednisolone has not been studied itself
and is not warranted because the majority of patients
respond to outpatient oral therapy. Ursodiol is not
indicated in the treatment of this patient.
VI.35. Answer b.
This patient has autoimmune hepatitis unresponsive to
conventional treatment. The ﬁrst approach is to increase
the baseline doses of prednisone and azathioprine. If
she is still unresponsive, trials of either cyclosporine or
tacrolimus would be appropriate. Mycophenolate
mofetil has been administered in refractory cases with
occasional success, but it is best used with azathioprineintolerant patients. Budesonide has been used but is

Questions and Answers

not effective in refractory cases. At this time, the patient
has no indication for transplantation.
VI.36. Answer c.
This patient has diabetes, hypertension, and class 1
obesity (by BMI deﬁnition), with fatty inﬁltration seen
on ultrasonography. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease
and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis are commonly associated with mildly increased autoantibody titers.
Although biopsy will help to distinguish between autoimmune disease and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, the
likelihood of autoimmune hepatitis is very low with no
other abnormal autoantibody (other than antinuclear
antibody). Following her liver test results in conjunction with weight loss is appropriate management.
VI.37. Answer d.
This patient has medically complicated obesity and has
failed weight loss attempts in the past. He has poorly
controlled diabetes and advancing ﬁbrosis at a relatively young age. The likelihood of successful weight
loss on his own is low. Bariatric surgery is indicated for
medically complicated class 2 obesity (BMI >35) or
class 3 obesity (BMI>40) without complication.
Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis itself can be considered
a medical complication of obesity and does not preclude candidacy for bariatric surgery. Hemochromatosis gene testing is not necessary; the normal iron
saturation essentially excludes hemochromatosis. An
abnormal ferritin value is common in patients with
nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.
VI.38. Answer c.
Intractable vomiting with dehydration and weight loss
in a young (19 year old) primigravida in the ﬁrst trimester is typical of hyperemesis gravidarum. The
transaminase values may be elevated more than tenfold and bilirubin increased up to 5 mg/dL. Acute viral
hepatitis is the commonest cause of jaundice in pregnancy and can occur at any time. Biochemically, the
enzyme values are consistent with viral hepatitis, but it
would be unusual for a patient with viral hepatitis to
have such severe vomiting. Acute fatty liver of pregnancy is a disease of the third trimester and does not
occur in the ﬁrst trimester. The appearance of gastric
outlet obstruction in a previously healthy person
would be rare and would not explain the increased
values in the liver tests. Gallbladder stones and cholecystitis are common in pregnancy but do not cause
such severe vomiting.
VI.39. Answer d.
This case has all the features to give a clinical diagnosis
of intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy, and the treatment of choice for this is ursodiol. Cholestyramine
would be third-line therapy (after dexamethasone).

397

There is no indication for liver biopsy or ERCP. This
would be a very unusual presentation and age group
for primary biliary cirrhosis—but again, therapy is
ursodiol and there is no urgency for diagnosis.
VI.40. Answer d.
The patient has severe acute liver disease in the third
trimester and has preeclampsia. Most severe liver disease in the third trimester is pregnancy-related and,
thus, acute fatty liver of pregnancy or HELLP syndrome. She has acute liver failure: severe acute illness,
coagulopathy, and encephalopathy. Acute fatty liver of
pregnancy is most likely to cause liver failure: severe
HELLP syndrome would be possible but the number
of platelets is 105,000/mm3 (not severe). Fulminant
hepatitis A or B is possible but less likely statistically.
Herpes gives anicteric hepatitis, and this patient has no
other unique features of herpes (no rash, fever, or leucopenia). Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy does
not produce liver failure.
VI.41. Answer b.
This patient has recurrent biliary colic. Although each
episode may respond to conservative measures, episodes are likely to increase in frequency and severity as
pregnancy proceeds. She is in the second trimester,
when cholecystectomy is safe. It should be performed
laparoscopically.
VI.42. Answer b.
A carefully planned pregnancy in a stable, healthy,
posttransplant patient can have excellent maternal and
fetal outcome, but this is a high-risk pregnancy with
increased fetal prematurity and dysmaturity. The
patient must be counseled that this is a high-risk pregnancy. Close monitoring of immunosuppression will
be necessary. There are no data in support of the idea
that less immunosuppression is needed, and rejection
can occur. Tacrolimus is as safe as cyclosporine, and
pregnancy data have been better in the tacrolimus era.
Many successful pregnancies have been completed
during treatment with prednisone and azathioprine,
but mycophenolate mofetil should be avoided because
few data are available.
VI.43. Answer b.
For an asymptomatic patient now 1 year after transplantation who previously had normal allograft function and an otherwise uncomplicated course while
receiving stable immunosuppression, recurrent liver
disease is always a possibility and is the major consideration in patients with hepatitis C. Rejection is
unlikely in a patient 10 months after transplantation
who has satisfactory drug levels. Cytomegalovirus
infection tends to occur within 1 to 3 months after
transplantation and generally produces symptoms.

398

Section VI Liver

Biliary disease is a consideration but usually does not
produce this degree of increase in aminotransferase
levels. The patient does not receive any medication
that commonly causes drug-induced liver injury.
VI.44. Answer c.
Hepatopulmonary syndrome is an indication for liver
transplantation, and these patients are assigned a
higher MELD score (MELD exception) than that
which would be based on calculation. Acetaminophen
hepatotoxicity is prevented by N-acetylcysteine if given
in the ﬁrst 12 hours. Patient b, with hepatocellular carcinoma, is beyond the Milan criteria or even expanded
criteria, as proposed by the University of California,
San Francisco group. Alcoholic hepatitis and untreated
alcoholism are contraindications to transplantation.
Patient e has a MELD score of 10, Child-TurcottePugh score of 6, and is early for transplantation,
although he will need it in the future.
VI.45. Answer d.
A 65-year-old woman with recurrent hepatic encephalopathy and decreasing functional status would beneﬁt from liver transplantation now before she becomes
more debilitated. However, with a MELD score of
15 and blood group 0, she is extremely unlikely, in
many programs, to receive a deceased donor liver. She
is a good candidate for using an expanded criteria
donor, including living donation, which has the same
patient survival rate as deceased donation.
VI.46. Answer d.
The patient has several features very suggestive of cytomegalovirus infection (reactivation in this case): week
5 is peak time, febrile illness, leucopenia, not acutely
ill, and mild increase in transaminase levels. Without
any previous rejection or hepatic artery problems,
these are less likely to occur at week 5, especially while
the patient is receiving triple therapy and has excellent
tacrolimus levels. C difﬁcile colitis explains diarrhea
but no other features here.
VI.47. Answer d.
This patient presents with symptoms consistent with
malabsorption. He has iron deﬁciency anemia without
evidence of gastrointestinal tract blood loss. It would
be important to exclude celiac disease, and a tissue
transglutaminase test would be the next most appropriate test. Abnormal liver tests are common in
patients with celiac disease, and a diagnosis of celiac
disease should be considered for patients who have
indeterminate abnormalities on liver tests. Abdominal
CT is not likely to add further information to liver
ultrasonography. Colonoscopy should be considered
in a patient with iron deﬁciency anemia but would not
be the next test because of the strong evidence of malabsorption. Similarly, MRCP is not necessary because
the ducts are not dilated on ultrasonography. Liver

biopsy could be considered, but the ﬁndings would
likely be nonspeciﬁc and not contribute to a speciﬁc
diagnosis.
VI.48. Answer c.
This woman presents with acute liver failure. She has
exposure to a person with hepatitis B, and the suspicion for acute hepatitis B is high. About 20% of patients
with acute liver failure from hepatitis B are HBsAgnegative. It is thought that the acute liver injury is due
to a prompt and vigorous immune response to the
virally infected hepatocytes. Although this may result
in clearance of HBsAg, it can produce severe liver
injury, as in this case. The recent exposure to hepatitis
B could be conﬁrmed best with an IgM antibody to
HBc. Herpes hepatitis characteristically is anicteric and
accompanied by very high levels of aminotransferases,
often more than several thousand. An acute presentation of Wilson’s disease should be considered in a
young patient with acute liver failure, although it characteristically causes smaller increases in aminotransferase levels and a lower alkaline phosphatase
level than seen in this patient. In addition, hyperbilirubinemia in acute Wilson’s disease is often due partly to
hemolysis; therefore, indirect bilirubin predominates
over direct bilirubin. A positive HCV RNA and a negative anti-HCV are typical in acute hepatitis C, but acute
HCV is a very rare cause of acute liver failure. Antinuclear antibody determination can be considered
because autoimmune hepatitis frequently presents
acutely; however, autoimmune hepatitis is an uncommon cause of acute liver failure and would be less likely
because of the patient’s exposure to hepatitis B.
VI.49. Answer b.
The patient has hepatitis C with genotype 2. At
4 weeks, HCV RNA is positive; that is, she had not
achieved a rapid virologic response, but she is now
HCV RNA-negative at 3 months. The recommendation would be to continue treatment for a total of 24
weeks. A 12- or 16-week course of therapy can be considered for patients with genotype 2 but only if the
patient is HCV RNA-negative at 4 weeks. Even with a
rapid virologic response, 24 weeks of therapy is superior to 12 weeks, especially for patients receiving ribavirin 800 mg/day as opposed to those having
weight-based dosing. Twelve months of therapy for
genotype 2 patients can be considered, but it generally
is not signiﬁcantly more effective than a 24-week
course of treatment.
VI.50. Answer d.
This patient has decompensated liver disease from
hepatitis B, with a positive test for HBeAg and a high
HBV DNA level. This would be consistent with HBeAgpositive chronic hepatitis B, with evidence of liver decompensation. Treatment is advised. Ideal treatment

Questions and Answers

should result in rapid improvement in HBV DNA and
be accompanied by a low risk of resistance. Tenofovir
or entecavir would be the best treatment for this
patient. Lamivudine would likely result in a rapid
decrease in HBV DNA but is accompanied by a high
rate of resistance and generally is not advised for
patients with decompensated cirrhosis. Resistance
with adefovir is lower than that with lamivudine but is
still high enough that it would not be the ﬁrst choice
for a patient with cirrhosis. Peginterferon can be effective for hepatitis B but should not be administered to
patients who have decompensated cirrhosis. The
patient certainly should be considered for liver transplantation, although therapy before transplantation is
advised. Not only might therapy result in clinical
improvement, but even if transplantation proves to be
necessary, the decrease in HBV DNA would be accompanied by a lower rate of posttransplant recurrence.
VI.51. Answer d.
This man presents with strong clinical evidence of
alcoholic hepatitis. Patients with alcoholic hepatitis
commonly have mild fever and leukocytosis, although
infection needs to be excluded. As is common with
alcoholic patients, the patient also is hepatitis C RNA
positive. Chemical dependency counseling would certainly be advised because abstinence may improve the
patient’s clinical symptoms or make him a candidate
for liver transplantation (or both). Patients with acetaminophen hepatotoxicity, for which N-acetylcysteine
might be given, generally have marked increases in
aminotransferase levels. Although the dose of acetaminophen necessary to produce liver injury in alcoholics is lower than for patients who do not consume
alcohol chronically, the low dose of acetaminophen
taken by this patient would not produce liver injury.
MRCP could be considered if the suspicion for bile
duct obstruction were high; however, with the clinical
history and the normal ultrasonographic ﬁndings, it
would not be necessary for this patient. Corticosteroids are considered as therapy for acute alcoholic hepatitis. Corticosteroids generally are given to patients
with severe disease, deﬁned as encephalopathy or a
discriminant function of more than 32. For patients
with a discriminant function less than 32 who have
hepatitis C, corticosteroids would best be avoided.
Pegylated interferon and ribavirin therapy is less effective for patients who are consuming alcohol in excess
and is relatively contraindicated for patients with evidence of hepatic decompensation.
VI.52. Answer d.
This patient presents with abnormal liver tests after an
episode of hypotension. The clinical pictures are consistent with hepatitic ischemia. Because of the dual
blood supply of the liver, hepatic ischemia generally
occurs only in patients who have an episode of

399

hypotension. Patients with chronic heart failure with
an element of hepatic congestion are more predisposed
to hepatic ischemia because they are more dependent
on hepatic arterial ﬂow. The treatment for this man
would be to try to optimize management of his cardiac
failure and to monitor liver tests. Abdominal CT would
not be necessary, because of the negative ultrasonographic results. Doppler examination of the hepatic
artery and portal vein is not necessary because hepatic
ischemia requires systemic hypotension. MRCP can be
considered if bile duct obstruction is a consideration.
Although transient bile duct obstruction from a stone
can produce transient abnormalities of aminotransferase levels, it generally is accompanied by abdominal
pain, which is not present in this patient. Amiodarone
can result in liver toxicity, but the increased aminotransferase levels started before amiodarone therapy
was instituted. Amiodarone is an important medication for patients with atrial arrhythmias and would be
important for this patient with severe cardiac disease.
VI.53. Answer b.
This patient is an inactive hepatitis B carrier and normally would not meet criteria for treatment; however,
patients who are HBsAg positive should be treated
with an antiviral agent during the course of chemotherapy and for 6 months afterward to prevent an
acute ﬂare of hepatitis B. An oral agent such as tenofovir would be a good option. Treatment with pegylated
interferon should be avoided for someone who is about
to receive chemotherapy. With normal liver enzymes
and a low HBV DNA level, this patient does not need a
liver biopsy.
VI.54. Answer b.
This individual has hepatitis C, genotype 1, with stage
III disease. After 6 months of full-dose pegylated
interferon and ribavirin therapy, HCV RNA remains
positive. This man will not have a response to therapy,
and discontinuation of treatment is advised. Continuing therapy for 3 more months might decrease the
HCV RNA level, but it is exceedingly unlikely to make
him HCV RNA negative and even more unlikely to
provide a sustained response. Adding ursodiol has no
role in the treatment of hepatitis C. Maintenance therapy with pegylated interferon has not been shown to
be beneﬁcial.
VI.55. Answer c.
This woman has hepatitis C, genotype 2. There are no
features of advanced disease, and it is likely that she
has had hepatitis C for only 10 years. The likelihood
of this patient having a response to treatment is very
high, and treatment would be advised. Liver biopsy
ﬁndings are not likely to change the management of
this patient. The only way liver biopsy ﬁndings might
change management is if the patient has cirrhosis,

400

Section VI Liver

which is unlikely because of the short duration of
hepatitis C and the normal ultrasonographic ﬁndings
and platelet count. Observation could be considered
if she has contraindications to therapy, but for genotype 2, response rates are so high that treatment generally is advised. Reassessment in 3 months would not
change management.
VI.56. Answer c.
This patient presents with acute liver failure. Results of
laboratory tests and copper studies are consistent with
Wilson’s disease. Patients with fulminant Wilson’s disease can be given decoppering agents, but the likelihood of avoiding liver transplantation is so low that
proceeding with immediate transplantation is advised.
This patient would be high priority and would likely
receive a liver relatively soon. Intracranial pressure
monitoring is used by some groups but is probably not
necessary at this point. Liver biopsy would only conﬁrm the diagnosis of Wilson’s disease and not change
clinical management.
VI.57. Answer c.
This patient has abnormal iron test results and is
homozygous for hereditary hemochromatosis. Phlebotomy would be advised. Liver biopsy is necessary
only if the ferritin level is more than 1,000 μg/L or if
liver enzyme levels are abnormal. Alcohol excess can
produce abnormal iron tests, but this patient’s consumption is not excessive.
VI.58. Answer d.
This 65-year-old man has evidence of sclerosing cholangitis with prominent distal bile duct stricture.

Although this may represent primary sclerosing
cholangitis, the patient does not have inﬂammatory
bowel disease, and IgG4-associated cholangitis should
be excluded. Therefore, the best next test would be
to determine the serum IgG4 level. Should IgG4associated cholangitis be conﬁrmed, treatment with
corticosteroids would be advised. MRCP, ERCP, and
endoscopic ultrasonography are not necessary at this
point unless the lack of another diagnosis is forthcoming. These tests would be especially useful if biliary
malignancy were a concern. Antimitochondrial antibody would be useful to diagnose primary biliary cirrhosis, a disease that does not produce abnormal ERCP
ﬁndings.
VI.59. Answer c.
This 36-year-old man has HIV infection and hepatitis
C. Currently, the HIV infection is minimally active,
with an HIV level that is low and a CD4 count that is
reasonably high. In this unusual situation in which the
patient also has relatively advanced stage hepatitis C,
the best option would be the introduction of pegylated
interferon therapy. Usually, antiretroviral therapy
would be initiated ﬁrst but is not necessary for this
man with controlled HIV disease. One reason to treat
hepatitis C ﬁrst is to decrease the risk of hepatotoxicity
from antiretroviral therapy that occurs in patients with
hepatitis C.

Acute Pancreatitisa
Randall K. Pearson, MD

Approximately 210,000 new cases of acute pancreatitis occur
annually in the United States, and its incidence is increasing in
and outside this country. Of the new cases, about 80% are the
interstitial (edematous) variety and the other 20% are the
necrotizing variety. Necrotizing pancreatitis accounts for most
of the morbidity and nearly all the mortality associated with
acute pancreatitis.

Etiologya

Gallstones and alcohol are the most common causes of acute
pancreatitis in the United States (Table 36.1). Gallstones are
the most common cause in afﬂuent populations, as is alcohol
in lower socioeconomic populations. An important metabolic
cause is hypertriglyceridemia; a threshold triglyceride level of
1,000 mg/dL has been established as being causative. Other
causes include hypercalcemia, medications (Table 36.2), trauma,
postoperative state, infections by various agents, and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). About
20% of cases of acute pancreatitis are classiﬁed as “idiopathic”
because no cause is found even after extensive testing. Debated
causes of acute pancreatitis are sphincter of Oddi dysfunction
and pancreas divisum.

Gallstones are thought to produce acute pancreatitis
because they pass into the common bile duct and obstruct the
channel shared by the bile duct and pancreatic duct.
Transaminase levels often are increased transiently in biliary
pancreatitis, reﬂecting liver injury associated with the obstruction of the bile duct. For example, more than a threefold
increase in the level of alanine aminotransferase in pancreatitis has a positive predictive value greater than 90% for a biliary
source.

Pathophysiology

The pathophysiology of acute pancreatitis generally is
considered to occur in at least two phases. The ﬁrst phase

is intracellular activation of trypsin in the acinar cell. Activated
trypsin, in turn, activates a cascade of digestive enzymes that
leads to autodigestion and cellular injury. The second phase
occurs when acinar cell injury leads to inﬂammation by
recruitment of inﬂammatory cells through cytokines and
other mediators. This process begins in the pancreatic gland
itself and ultimately leads to a systemic inﬂammatory response
syndrome (SIRS). In 80% of cases, acute pancreatitis is mild
and self-limited, with little or no long-term sequelae to the
pancreatic parenchyma or systemic toxicity. In 20% of cases,
severe acute pancreatitis develops, leading in the early phase to
SIRS and organ failure (hypotension, renal failure, and acute

respiratory distress syndrome) and pancreatic necrosis. Most
of the morbidity and mortality early in the course of severe
acute pancreatitis is due to systemic toxicity secondary to
SIRS, whereas late (more than 10–14 days) mortality is related
to pancreatic necrosis and infection.

Clinical Presentation and Diagnosis

The clinical presentation of acute pancreatitis ranges from
mild, nonspeciﬁc epigastric pain to a catastrophic acute medical illness. The pain of acute pancreatitis generally is located in
the epigastrium and radiates into the back in approximately
50% of patients. The onset of pain usually is swift, with pain
reaching maximum intensity within an hour. Pain is often
unbearable and generally persists for at least 24 hours without
intervention. Pain often is accompanied by nausea and vomiting. In severe episodes of acute pancreatitis, SIRS dominates
and patients appear systemically ill, with fever, tachycardia,
tachypnea, and hypotension.
The consensus is that the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis
requires two of the following three ﬁndings: 1) abdominal
pain that is consistent with acute pancreatitis; 2) serum level
of amylase or lipase more than three times the upper limit of
normal; 3) ﬁndings of acute pancreatitis seen on computed
tomography (CT).
These criteria indicate that the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis can be made on the basis of pain and diagnostic levels of
amylase and lipase, obviating the need for imaging. In cases in
which the serum levels of amylase or lipase are not increased
threefold, the lack of speciﬁcity of this ﬁnding indicates the
need for imaging, most commonly CT, to establish the diagnosis. The deﬁnition also indicates the possibility of diagnosing acute pancreatitis when a patient is unable to give a clinical
history because of altered mental status or the severity of the
acute presentation.
Both amylase and lipase levels usually are increased during
the acute phase of pancreatitis. The serum lipase level generally is preferred to the serum amylase level because the lipase
level remains elevated for a longer period. Also, lipase levels
may be more speciﬁc than amylase levels. The amylase level is
increased nonspeciﬁcally in various nonpancreatic conditions,
including macroamylasemia, diseases of the parotid glands,
and some carcinomas.
Importantly, the level of either lipase or amylase does not
have any prognostic value and is not predictive of severity.
Furthermore, after the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis has been
made, serial measurements of lipase and amylase levels have
no prognostic value in guiding management and should be
avoided.
The differential diagnosis of acute pancreatitis is broad and
includes most of the important causes of abdominal pain,
including mesenteric ischemia and infarction, perforated
peptic ulcer, symptomatic cholelithiasis, dissecting aortic
aneurysm, intestinal obstruction, and inferior wall myocardial
infarction.

36 Acute Pancreatitis

Severity Stratiﬁcation
Patient Characteristics

Age older than 55 years, obesity (body mass index >30 kg/m2),
organ failure at admission (especially renal or respiratory),
and pleural effusions have been identiﬁed as risk factors
for a severe course. Patients with these ﬁndings may require
close observation and perhaps even admission to an intensive
care unit.
Several severity-of-illness classiﬁcations for acute pancreatitis are used to identify patients at risk for the development of
complications. The Ranson score consists of 11 clinical signs
with prognostic signiﬁcance: 5 criteria are measured at the
time of admission, and 6 criteria are measured between admission and 48 hours later (Table 36.3). The number of Ranson
signs and the incidence of systemic complications and presence of pancreatic necrosis are correlated. The Acute
Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II
score is a grading system based on 12 physiologic variables,
patient age, and previous history of severe organ system insufﬁciency or immunocompromised state (Table 36.4). It allows
stratiﬁcation of the severity of illness on admission and may be
recalculated daily. The main disadvantage of the Ranson score
is that it may not be completed until 48 hours after admission.
The APACHE II scoring system has the advantage of being
completed at the initial presentation as well as being repeated
daily, but it is cumbersome to use.

405

The Atlanta classiﬁcation is the most widely used clinical
system for indicating the severity of acute pancreatitis. This
classiﬁcation recognizes mild and severe types of the disease,
which are synonymous with the interstitial and necrotizing
types, respectively. It classiﬁes an attack of acute pancreatitis
as severe if any of the following criteria are met: 1) organ
failure with one or more of the following—shock (systolic
blood pressure <90 mm Hg), pulmonary insufﬁciency (Pao2
<60 mm Hg), renal failure (serum creatinine level >2 mg/dL
after rehydration), or gastrointestinal tract bleeding (>500 mL
in 24 hours); 2) local complications such as pseudocyst, abscess,
or pancreatic necrosis; 3) three or more Ranson criteria; or 4)

eight or more APACHE II criteria. Terms such as phlegmon,
hemorrhagic pancreatitis, infected pseudocyst, and persistent
pancreatitis were omitted because of the confusion they
caused.
Because the scoring systems outlined above are cumbersome and often require 48 hours of observation, clinical investigators have sought a single biochemical marker for severity.
The acute phase reaction C-reactive protein has been shown
to predict severity, but its level generally has to increase to
more than 150 mg/L over 36 to 72 hours after admission
before it can be used to score severity. Other simple markers
have included serum glucose and creatinine, but all have poor
speciﬁcity.
In severe acute pancreatitis, considerable extravasation of
ﬂuid occurs into third spaces, resulting in hemoconcentration
and increased serum hematocrit. Hemoconcentration has
been proposed as a reliable predictor of necrotizing pancreatitis. This is particularly true if the hematocrit does not decrease
after 24 hours, which likely predicts inadequate volume resuscitation. According to other reports, hemoconcentration,
although quite sensitive, is nonspeciﬁc in that it “overpredicts”
severity. This is the problem with most of the single biochemical markers determined on admission.
A recently proposed scoring system, the Harmless Acute
Pancreatitis Score, attempts to identify patients who have a
mild, self-limited course rather than severe disease. Its components include absence of rebound tenderness on physical
examination, normal hematocrit, and normal serum level of
creatinine. A combination of all these components has been
found to predict with 98% accuracy a mild course of acute
pancreatitis. This has been validated in several European studies and may guide clinicians in at least identifying patients
who do not need aggressive early management.

pancreas. Note that the pancreas (P) has a uniform enhancement
intermediate between that of the liver (L) and spleen (S).

Abdominal Imaging Studies

In acute pancreatitis, plain abdominal radiographs are frequently normal, but they are useful in excluding perforation.
A nonspeciﬁc ileus may be present as well as a focally dilated
small-bowel loop, the so-called sentinel loop. The colon-cutoff
sign refers to the abrupt narrowing of the gas in the transverse
colon seen on a plain ﬁlm of the abdomen in the vicinity of the
body of the pancreas.
Abdominal ultrasonography is frequently nondiagnostic in
acute pancreatitis because overlying bowel gas may obscure
the pancreas. However, ultrasonography is sensitive for detecting gallstones and, thus, adds clinical information about the
underlying cause of the pancreatitis.
If the diagnosis is in doubt, the best imaging study is
abdominal CT. Intravenous contrast enhancement not only
provides diagnostic information but offers the possibility of
additional prognostic information. Pancreatic perfusion is
disrupted in the case of pancreatic necrosis and is detectable
only if intravenous contrast is given (Fig. 36.1 and 36.2). A CT
classiﬁcation system for the severity of acute pancreatitis has

pancreatitis after endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography.

tail (green arrowhead).

been developed on the basis of the degree of necrosis and
number of ﬂuid collections. High mortality can be expected if
the CT severity index of Balthazar is 7 or more. Patients with
acute pancreatitis who have normal CT ﬁndings have a good
prognosis. The correlation is good between the failure of more
than 30% of the pancreas to enhance on contrast-enhanced
CT and the ﬁnding of pancreatic necrosis at surgery or autopsy.
As the degree of necrosis increases, there is a corresponding
increase in morbidity and mortality.

36 Acute Pancreatitis

It is important to recognize that features of poor perfusion
are often lacking in the ﬁrst 48 to 72 hours after the onset of
acute pancreatitis. Thus, CT early in the course of disease may
not show necrosis and be falsely reassuring. In deﬁnite cases of
acute pancreatitis, contrast-enhanced CT can be performed
after 3 days if the patient’s condition is not responding to supportive care or earlier if it is deteriorating in order to conﬁrm
the presence of necrosis and to manage the patient accordingly. Recently, magnetic resonance imaging has been compared prospectively with CT in the context of severe
pancreatitis and found to be reliable for staging severity, to
have predictive value for the prognosis of the disease, and to
have fewer contraindications than CT. It also can detect disruption of the pancreatic duct, which may occur early in the
course of acute pancreatitis.

Treatment

Because the prognosis of interstitial pancreatitis is different
from that of necrotizing pancreatitis, management of the two
is discussed separately.
Interstitial Acute Pancreatitis

Patients with interstitial pancreatitis may be managed on a
general hospital ward, without need for intensive care monitoring. Often, all that is needed is to withhold oral intake
and liberally administer intravenous ﬂuids and analgesics.
Nasogastric tubes should not be used routinely because they
do not improve disease outcome and add to patient discomfort. However, for patients with exceptional nausea and vomiting and ileus, a nasogastric tube may help relieve the symptoms.
Empiric use of antibiotics should be avoided in interstitial pancreatitis because these agents do not alter the outcome.
If laboratory ﬁndings (increased levels of transaminases or
bilirubin or both) and ultrasonography indicate that gallstones
are the cause of the pancreatitis, cholecystectomy should be
performed before hospital dismissal to prevent recurrent
attacks of acute pancreatitis. If the patient is a poor surgical
candidate because of severe coexisting medical illness, ERCP
with biliary sphincterotomy may be a good alternative to
cholecystectomy, especially if ultrasonography demonstrates
only sludge or small stones.
If the cause of pancreatitis is in doubt, the serum levels of
lipids should be determined and drugs that may have caused
acute pancreatitis should be reviewed thoroughly. In addition,
abdominal ultrasonography should be performed. After this,
if the cause is still in doubt, abdominal CT should be performed to exclude anatomical causes of pancreatic ductal
obstruction, such as a pancreatic or ampullary mass lesion,
or suggestion of intraductal mucinous papillary tumor, especially in patients older than 50 years. For elderly patients,
endoscopic ultrasonography, magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography, or ERCP should be considered if the CT
ﬁndings are negative.

407

Acute Necrotizing Pancreatitis
Supportive Care

The management of patients with clinically severe pancreatitis
due to pancreatic necrosis is different from that for patients
with interstitial pancreatitis. In recent years, the management
of these patients has shifted from early surgical débridement
(necrosectomy) to aggressive intensive medical care. Aggressive
medical management, with emphasis on the prevention and
early diagnosis of infection, has allowed prompt identiﬁcation
of complications and improvement in outcome.
Aggressive intravenous ﬂuid replacement is of utmost
importance in the early phases of managing severe acute pancreatitis. This is done to counteract intravascular volume
depletion caused by third space losses, vomiting, fever, and the
vascular permeability caused by SIRS. Furthermore, impaired
intravascular volume compromises the blood supply of the
pancreas and is a major contributor to the development of
necrotizing pancreatitis, with its attendant complications. As
noted above, intravascular volume depletion causes hemoconcentration, tachycardia, hypotension, low urine output,
and azotemia. Abundant evidence from experimental models
supports the concept that early aggressive ﬂuid resuscitation
minimizes or aborts pancreatic necrosis and improves survival. Although human studies have not been performed in
clinical practice and would be difﬁcult to randomize, considerable evidence from large-scale databases supports the importance of aggressive ﬂuid resuscitation. In one study, all patients
who exhibited hemoconcentration at admission and whose
hematocrit increased during the ﬁrst 24 hours (indicating
inadequate volume resuscitation) developed pancreatic necrosis. It is critically important that the adequacy of ﬂuid resuscitation be monitored aggressively, including checking vital
signs, following the decrease in hematocrit at 12 and 24 hours,
and measuring urinary output. This may require admission to
an intensive care unit.
Patient-controlled analgesia for pain control requires fentanyl or morphine. Although animal experiments indicated
that morphine caused spasm of the sphincter of Oddi, there
is no deﬁnite human evidence that morphine worsens the
disease.
Early mortality (within the ﬁrst 1 or 2 weeks) is due to
multisystem organ failure resulting from SIRS. Systemic
complications include adult respiratory distress syndrome,
acute renal failure, shock, coagulopathy, hyperglycemia, and
hypocalcemia. These complications are managed with endotracheal intubation, aggressive ﬂuid resuscitation, fresh frozen
plasma, insulin, and calcium, as needed.
Nutritional Support

To meet increased metabolic demands and to “rest” the
pancreas, total parenteral nutrition has been used frequently
for nutritional support of patients with acute necrotizing
pancreatitis, but it is expensive and has signiﬁcant risk

408

Section VII Pancreas and Biliary Tree

of complications. In randomized prospective studies of severe
acute pancreatitis that compared total parenteral nutrition
with enteral feeding (through a nasoenteric feeding tube
placed under endoscopic or radiographic guidance beyond
the ligament of Treitz), patients who received enteral feeding
had signiﬁcantly fewer total and infectious complications, a
threefold decrease in the cost of nutritional support, and
improvement in acute phase response and disease severity
scores. Also, a recent meta-analysis of enteral and parenteral
nutrition in patients with acute pancreatitis reported that
enteral nutrition was associated with a signiﬁcantly lower incidence of infections, decreased number of surgical interventions to control pancreatitis, and a reduction in mortality.
Enteral nutrition, by preserving the mucosal barrier of the gut
and preventing translocation of bacteria (and thus decreasing
the rate of infected necrosis), should be considered the standard of care for patients with severe acute pancreatitis.
Placement of the feeding tube in the jejunum, theoretically
to decrease stimulation of the inﬂamed pancreas, adds considerable expense and is not readily available in all community
hospitals. Nasogastric feeding is simpler and, according to a
small European study, equally effective. This concept is the
subject of a recently launched multicenter randomized trial in
the United States.

Detection of Pancreatic Infection

Although sterile and infected acute necrotizing pancreatitis
can be difﬁcult to distinguish clinically because both may
produce fever, leukocytosis, and severe abdominal pain, the
distinction is important. Without intervention, the mortality
rate for patients with infected acute necrotizing pancreatitis is
nearly 100%. The bacteriologic status of the pancreas may be
determined with CT-guided ﬁne-needle aspiration of pancreatic and peripancreatic tissue or ﬂuid. This aspiration method
is safe, accurate (sensitivity of 96% and speciﬁcity of 99%),
and recommended for patients with acute necrotizing pancreatitis whose condition deteriorates clinically or fails to
improve despite aggressive supportive care. Ultrasonographically guided aspiration may have a lower sensitivity and speciﬁcity, but it can be performed at the bedside. Surveillance
aspiration may be repeated on a weekly basis as indicated clinically. If CT-guided percutaneous aspiration documents the
presence of gram-negative organisms, appropriate choices for
antibiotics include a carbapenem, a ﬂuoroquinolone with
metronidazole, or a third-generation cephalosporin plus metronidazole. If Gram staining shows gram-positive organisms,
the addition of vancomycin is appropriate. In all cases, antibiotic coverage can be narrowed or expanded once the identity and sensitivities of the organism are known.

Prophylactic Antibiotics
Surgical Therapy for Pancreatic Necrosis

The prevention of infection is critical because infected necrosis develops in 30% of patients with acute necrotizing pancreatitis and accounts for more than 80% of deaths due to
acute pancreatitis. Therefore, prophylactic antibiotics theoretically would have an advantage and possibly would decrease
the risk of infection. Confusion and controversy exist about
this concept despite six randomized prospective trials. Most of
these trials were not double-blinded and had serious design
ﬂaws. Contrary to what was thought only a few years ago,
recent meta-analyses have concluded that prophylactic antibiotics cannot be recommended for preventing pancreatic infection. There is no difference in the rate of infected necrosis,
systemic complications, or mortality in the treatment versus
control group. This is largely because the results of the two
most recent multicenter and double-blinded studies that
examined the effectiveness of prophylactic antibiotics have
been negative. Furthermore, there is concern that the use of
potent broad-spectrum antibiotics would only increase the
risk for a secondary superimposed fungal infection. According
to recently published guidelines, prophylactic antibiotics are
not recommended for necrotizing pancreatitis. Certainly,
there is no indication for routine antibiotics in treating mild
or interstitial pancreatitis.
Clinically, during the ﬁrst 7 to 10 days, patients with severe
pancreatitis often have all the features of sepsis, including
fever, leukocytosis, and organ failure. While the source of
infection is being sought, antibiotic therapy is appropriate. It
is advised that after culture material has been obtained and
proved to be negative, antibiotic therapy be discontinued.

After decades of clinical experience and research, the timing
and type of pancreatic intervention for acute necrotizing pancreatitis is still debated. Because the mortality rate of sterile
acute necrotizing pancreatitis is approximately 10% and surgical intervention has not been shown to decrease this rate, nonsurgical therapy is recommended. Conversely, infected acute
necrotizing pancreatitis is considered uniformly fatal without
intervention. After infected necrosis has been conﬁrmed, the
treatment of choice is surgical necrosectomy or débridement.
Surgical débridement is a morbid procedure and often
requires multiple surgical interventions. Recently, guidelines
have suggested that surgical débridement be performed for
patients with infected necrosis who appear “septic” or whose
condition is failing clinically. Increasingly, patients with
infected necrosis whose condition is stable are receiving aggressive medical management to delay invasive intervention and
débridement. Several position papers have suggested that
patients who are stable clinically should receive 2 to 3 weeks of
antibiotic therapy and aggressive medical management before
surgical débridement, to allow the inﬂammatory reaction to
subside and the infected necrosis to become organized.
Anecdotal reports and a single prospective study in which
antibiotics were used to delay surgical débridement support
the concept of delaying débridement of infected necrosis. The
patients generally are better candidates for surgery, and the
normal healthy retroperitoneal tissues are distinguished more
easily from necrotic tissue. The timing of surgical débridement,
whether promptly after infection has been identiﬁed or delayed

36 Acute Pancreatitis

for several weeks, should be reviewed in a multidisciplinary
fashion with input from an experienced pancreatic surgeon.
To add to the controversy, several other less invasive procedures have been introduced. Radiologists as well as endoscopists are now capable of accessing the necrotic area and
performing necrosectomy without operative management.
However, none of these techniques has been compared headto-head in a randomized controlled clinical trial.
Role of Endoscopic Retrograde
Cholangiopancreatography

ERCP with biliary sphincterotomy may improve the outcome
of patients who have severe gallstone pancreatitis. Initial studies in which urgent ERCP (within 72 hours after admission)
and biliary sphincterotomy were performed in patients with
acute gallstone pancreatitis and choledocholithiasis showed
improved outcome for only the group of patients who presented with clinically severe acute pancreatitis and included
patients with overt biliary obstruction and cholangitis. A
more recent, larger multicenter study that excluded such
patients showed no beneﬁt from early ERCP in severe acute
pancreatitis. This suggests that improved outcome after ERCP
and sphincterotomy in gallstone pancreatitis may be the result
of reduced biliary sepsis rather than actual improvement in
pancreatitis. In our practice, ERCP is reserved for patients
with biliary obstruction suspected on the basis of hyperbilirubinemia and clinical cholangitis.
Prognosis

The overall mortality rate for severe acute pancreatitis has
decreased as a result of improved intensive care unit therapies,
antibiotics, and delay of surgery and is now approximately
15%. Mortality occurs in two phases: 1) early deaths (1–2 weeks
after the onset of pancreatitis, approximately 50% of all deaths)
are due to multisystem organ failure from the release of
inﬂammatory mediators and cytokines and 2) late deaths
result from local or systemic infections. As long as acute necrotizing pancreatitis remains sterile, the overall mortality rate is
approximately 10%. The mortality rate at least triples if
infected necrosis occurs. Patients with sterile necrosis and
high severity-of-illness scores (Ranson score or APACHE II
score) accompanied by multisystem organ failure, shock, or
renal insufﬁciency have a signiﬁcantly higher mortality rate.
Long-Term Sequelae of Acute Necrotizing
Pancreatitis

Despite the enormous cost of caring for patients who have acute
necrotizing pancreatitis, the mean quality-of-life outcomes up
to 2 years after treatment of pancreatic necrosis are similar to
those for coronary artery bypass grafting. The long-term clinical endocrine and exocrine consequences of acute necrotizing
pancreatitis appear to depend on several factors: the severity of
necrosis, cause (alcoholic vs nonalcoholic), continued use of

409

alcohol, and the degree of surgical pancreatic débridement.
Sophisticated exocrine function studies have shown persistent
functional insufﬁciency in the majority of patients up to
2 years after severe acute pancreatitis. Treatment with pancreatic enzymes should be restricted to patients with symptoms
of steatorrhea and weight loss due to fat malabsorption.
Although subtle glucose intolerance is frequent, overt diabetes
mellitus is uncommon.
If the necrosis is severe, the pancreatic duct can be disrupted, leading to recurrent ﬂuid collections and causing
symptoms and risk of recurrent infection. In some cases, correction of the “disconnected duct syndrome” is accomplished
by endoscopic stent placement to reestablish drainage of the
secreting pancreatic segment. However, management often
requires surgical resection (“distal pancreatectomy”) of the
secreting pancreatic body and tail that lack communication
with the duodenum.

Chronic Pancreatitis
Suresh T. Chari, MD

Chronic pancreatitis is an often painful inﬂammatory condition of the pancreas characterized by progressive ﬁbrosis that
leads to irreversible destruction of exocrine and endocrine
tissue, resulting eventually in exocrine and endocrine insufﬁciency. There is considerable heterogeneity in the presentation
and natural history of the condition. Chronic pancreatitis
is classiﬁed broadly into chronic calcifying pancreatitis,
chronic obstructive pancreatitis, and chronic autoimmune
pancreatitis.
Chronic calcifying pancreatitis is characterized by recurrent
bouts of clinically acute pancreatitis early in the course of the
disease, with development of intraductal stones later in the
disease course. Steatorrhea and diabetes mellitus develop in
the majority of patients. This is the clinical proﬁle of the disease that readily comes to mind when the term chronic pancreatitis is used in clinical practice.a
Chronic obstructive pancreatitis results from obstruction of
the pancreatic duct due to any cause. The disease affects only
the organ distal to the obstruction. It usually is not associated
with stone formation. Although often asymptomatic, partial
obstruction can lead to recurrent bouts of clinically acute
pancreatitis involving the obstructed part of the gland.
Obstructive pancreatitis is commonly seen distal to pancreatic
tumors (ductal adenocarcinoma and intraductal papillary
mucinous tumor) and postinﬂammatory strictures following
acute or traumatic pancreatitis. Resection of the obstructed
distal pancreas is the preferred treatment for symptomatic
disease.
Chronic autoimmune pancreatitis is a unique form of
chronic pancreatitis that can be deﬁned as a systemic ﬁbroinﬂammatory disease that afﬂicts not only the pancreas but also

Abbreviations: CT, computed tomography; ERCP, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography; EUS, endoscopic ultrasonography; MRCP, magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography;
MRI, magnetic resonance imaging

various other organs, including the bile duct, salivary glands,
retroperitoneum, and lymph nodes. Organs affected by autoimmune pancreatitis have a lymphoplasmacytic inﬁltrate rich
in IgG4-positive cells. The pancreas has a typical histologic
pattern, called lymphoplasmacytic sclerosing pancreatitis, characterized by a dense lymphoplasmacytic inﬁltrate around
medium-sized ducts, a peculiar swirling (“storiform”) ﬁbrosis, and an intense inﬂammation that surrounds veins (obliterative phlebitis) and spares adjacent arteries. The most
common presentation of this form of chronic pancreatitis is
with obstructive jaundice mimicking pancreatic cancer; it
rarely presents with clinical acute or painful chronic pancreatitis. Pancreatic calciﬁcation is not common in autoimmune
pancreatitis. Autoimmune pancreatitis is thought to be a systemic autoimmune disorder; its best known serologic marker
is an increased level of IgG4, a subtype of immunoglobulin G.
The inﬂammatory process responds to corticosteroid therapy,
although relapse is common after withdrawal of treatment.
Many patients require long-term immunosuppression with
either a low dose of corticosteroids or steroid-sparing agents
such as azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, or mycophenolate
mofetil.
The rest of the discussion in this chapter is related to
chronic calcifying pancreatitis.

Etiology

Several conditions are associated with chronic calcifying pancreatitis (Table 37.1). The pathogenesis of chronic pancreatitis
due to these presumed etiologic agents is largely unknown.
However, currently, clinical acute pancreatitis and the eventual development of chronic pancreatitis are thought to be due
to the interaction between genetic and environmental factors.
This applies not only to etiologic factors strongly associated
with genetic mutations (eg, cationic trypsinogen gene mutations), but also to toxic-metabolic causes (eg, alcohol abuse).

Six genes are associated with pancreatitis: cationic trypsinogen

protease inhibitor Kazal 1 gene (SPINK1), cystic ﬁbrosis
transmembrane conductance regulator gene (CFTR), chymotrypsinogen C gene (CTRC), and calcium-sensing receptor
gene (CASR). Interaction between these and other as yet
unknown genetic factors and environmental, toxic, and metabolic factors (alcohol, smoking, hyperlipidemia, and hypercalcemia) are thought to lead to acute and chronic pancreatitis.

difﬁcult when pancreatic structure and function are not
unequivocally abnormal. Currently available diagnostic
modalities are not adequate for making a ﬁrm diagnosis of
chronic pancreatitis without obvious changes in structure and
function.
Structural Evaluation

Computed tomography (CT), endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), endoscopic ultrasonography
(EUS), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and magnetic
resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) are the imaging procedures commonly used to evaluate for structural
changes in the pancreas. Pancreatic calciﬁcation suggestive
but not diagnostic of chronic pancreatitis can be identiﬁed
on abdominal radiographs. However, CT and EUS can
detect small specks of calciﬁcations not visible on plain
radiographs.
Abdominal CT is a good ﬁrst test for the evaluation of a
patient who has possible chronic pancreatitis. It is noninvasive, widely available, and has relatively good sensitivity for
diagnosing moderate-to-severe chronic pancreatitis. The ﬁndings, however, can be normal in early chronic pancreatitis.
Chronic pancreatitis is diagnosed with CT by the identiﬁcation of pathognomonic calciﬁcations within the main pancreatic duct or parenchyma or calciﬁcation within the dilated
main pancreatic duct in combination with parenchymal atrophy. CT is also suitable for the evaluation of pain in a patient
with known chronic pancreatitis, because most complications
of chronic pancreatitis, including peripancreatic ﬂuid collections, bile duct obstruction, and bowel obstruction, can be
identiﬁed and inﬂammatory or neoplastic masses larger than
1 cm can be visualized reliably.
In the absence of a tissue diagnosis, ERCP is quite sensitive
and speciﬁc for diagnosing moderate to severe pancreatitis.
Pancreatic ductal changes seen on ERCP in chronic pancreatitis
are listed in Table 37.2. Minor changes in the ducts are hard to

Diagnosis

Although histologic examination is the “gold standard” for
diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis, it often is not available.
Without histologic study, a combination of morphologic ﬁndings on imaging studies, functional abnormalities, and clinical
ﬁndings is used to diagnose chronic pancreatitis. The diagnosis
is relatively straightforward in the later stages of the disease
when calciﬁcation and steatorrhea are present. The diagnosis is

interpret and are subject to interobserver variation. Falsepositive results may be obtained in older patients who may
have benign pancreatic duct changes without pancreatitis and
in patients with recent acute pancreatitis who develop reversible or permanent pancreatic duct changes in the absence of
chronic pancreatitis.
Diagnostic ERCP carries a small (2%–5%) risk of causing
complications, including pancreatitis. Therapeutic maneuvers
have a higher risk of complication. ERCP is useful when other
methods are nondiagnostic or unavailable, when patients have
a clinical pattern of recurrent acute pancreatitis, or when a
therapeutic intervention is being considered.
EUS provides high-resolution images of the pancreatic
parenchyma and duct. Unlike ERCP, which can provide
detailed images of changes in the pancreatic duct, EUS provides information about the pancreatic parenchyma as well as
the duct. However, the role of EUS and the diagnostic criteria
for diagnosing chronic pancreatitis with EUS are still being
evaluated. Problems with interpretation may arise in older
patients who have senile changes in the pancreas, in alcoholics
in whom ﬁbrosis may be present but not pancreatitis, and in
patients who had a recent episode of acute pancreatitis. There
is also the problem of interobserver variability in interpretation. Currently, the diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis should
not be based on EUS criteria alone.
MRCP is noninvasive, avoids the use of ionizing radiation
and the administration of contrast, and does not routinely
require sedation, making it a diagnostic procedure of choice
for some groups of patients. MRCP also avoids the risks
associated with ERCP. In combination with conventional
abdominal MRI, MRCP can provide comprehensive information about the pancreas and peripancreatic tissues. Major
lesions such as grossly dilated ducts, communicating pseudocysts, and even pancreas divisum can be detected, but small
duct changes and calciﬁcations are not readily visualized. Also,
the combination of MRI and MRCP does not have therapeutic
potential.
Functional Testing in the Evaluation of
Chronic Pancreatitis

The pancreas has great functional reserve, which means it
must be damaged severely before functional loss is recognized
clinically. For example, 90% of the pancreas has to be destroyed
before steatorrhea occurs. Abnormal results of functional testing alone are not diagnostic of chronic pancreatitis, and diagnosis requires additional evidence of structural alteration seen
on imaging studies consistent with chronic pancreatitis.
Imaging studies by themselves usually are diagnostic by the
time steatorrhea develops. Invasive tests of pancreatic function (eg, the “tubed” secretin test) show functional impairment even in the absence of steatorrhea. However, these tests
are not widely available. Noninvasive tests of pancreatic function such as fecal fat estimation have poor sensitivity for the
detection of early disease.

Clinical Features and Natural History

Abdominal pain is the dominant symptom in the early part of
the natural history of chronic pancreatitis, and steatorrhea
and diabetes mellitus are the prominent features of late, endstage disease. Pain is often related to acute inﬂammatory ﬂares.
Some authors have reported a painless “burn out” of the pancreas in the late stages of the disease, but others have reported
pain occurring even in late stages. Complications can occur
after acute ﬂares of pancreatitis or from chronic ﬁbrosis in and
around the pancreas.
The clinical features and natural history of chronic pancreatitis can differ remarkably in different forms of chronic
pancreatitis. The age at onset of pain is much lower (ﬁrst and
second decades of life) in the hereditary and tropical forms of
chronic pancreatitis. Although pain is a dominant feature of
most forms of chronic pancreatitis, it may be absent in half
of the patients who have late-onset (senile) idiopathic chronic
pancreatitis. Diabetes and calciﬁcation are uncommon at diagnosis in alcoholic pancreatitis, but they are present at diagnosis
in more than 80% of patients with tropical pancreatitis.
In alcoholic chronic pancreatitis, death often is related to
smoking and nonpancreatic and alcohol-related complications (especially cancers). In tropical pancreatitis, the most
common cause of death is diabetes-related complications,
followed by pancreatic cancer. Pancreatic cancer can complicate any form of chronic pancreatitis, but it is especially
common in the hereditary and tropical forms, probably
because of the long duration of disease.

Complications
Diabetes Mellitus

Progressive decrease in islet cell mass leads to diabetes mellitus
in chronic pancreatitis. Whereas diabetes is common at presentation in the tropical form of chronic pancreatitis, it is
usually a late complication in other forms of the disease. The
majority (85%) of patients, with or without resection, eventually develop diabetes, and nonresective surgery such as ductal
drainage does not prevent it.
Steatorrhea

Steatorrhea occurs after more than 90% of the gland has been
destroyed. Treatment involves oral pancreatic enzyme supplements. These come as uncoated tablets or enteric-coated
capsules or microspheres with pH-dependent release of
enzymes. Patients with severe steatorrhea require 30,000
to 45,000 USP of lipase per meal and lesser amounts with
snacks. Enzymes should be given with meals to allow proper
mixing of food with the enzymes. Acid suppression may be
required to prevent destruction of the enzymes by gastric acid.
Fat-soluble vitamin levels should be measured at baseline and

414

Section VII Pancreas and Biliary Tree

monitored periodically to correct any concomitant nutritional
deﬁciencies.
Pseudocyst

In the early stages of the disease, pseudocysts are the result of
a pancreatic duct leak following an attack of clinically acute
pancreatitis. In later stages, ductal dilation can lead to leakage
and the formation of pseudocyst from duct “blowout.”
Upstream ductal obstruction due to stricture often results in
the reformation of pseudocysts after simple enteral drainage
(eg, endoscopic cyst drainage). This may require concomitant
drainage of the main pancreatic duct (usually surgically) or
resection of the diseased portion of the gland (or both).
Biliary Obstruction

Biliary obstruction could result from edema of the head of the
gland following an acute attack, compression from a pseudocyst, bile duct entrapment in the ﬁbrotic process involving
the head of the gland, and complicating pancreatic malignancy
in patients with long-standing disease. Edema of the head
of the gland usually responds to conservative management,
and compression of a pseudocyst responds to drainage of
the pseudocyst. Fibrotic stricturing requires surgical biliary
bypass. Pancreatic cancer complicating chronic pancreatitis can
be difﬁcult to diagnose early. Conﬁrmed or suspected malignancy should be treated with resective surgery, if operable.
Duodenal Obstruction

Potentially reversible gastric outlet obstruction can occur
during an acute ﬂare of pancreatitis secondary to peripancreatic inﬂammation involving the gastroduodenal region.
Nasojejunal feeding may be required to maintain nutrition
during this period. Patients with a ﬁbrotic process involving
the duodenum require surgical bypass of the gastric outlet
obstruction.
Splenic Vein Thrombosis

Because of the proximity of the splenic vein with the pancreas,
the vein is often affected by pancreatic inﬂammation or ﬁbrosis. Patients with left-sided portal hypertension (or sinistral
portal hypertension) can present with gastric variceal bleeding, which is treated with splenectomy.

Management

Abdominal pain is the most dominant and vexing problem in
the management of patients with chronic pancreatitis. It can
vary in severity from mild, intermittent pain to severe, chronic,
debilitating pain. In addition to the addiction to alcohol and
tobacco that patients with alcoholic pancreatitis often have,
there is also considerable potential for addiction to narcotics

by those with severe pain. It is very difﬁcult to assess the true
severity of the pain of patients addicted to narcotics, and therapeutic interventions often are seemingly unsuccessful because
of continued dependence on narcotics. Apart from these
issues, our poor understanding of the pathogenesis of pain has
made it difﬁcult to rationally manage abdominal pain in
chronic pancreatitis. Despite some optimism that pancreatic
pain eventually “burns out,” most clinicians agree that the
pain may diminish but rarely disappears with time.
A stepwise approach to pain management is recommended.
However, the scientiﬁc evidence to support any of the
measures taken (medical, endoscopic, or surgical) is scant,
and there are very few well-deﬁned prospective trials of therapy, either in comparison with no therapy or with competing
therapy.
An important ﬁrst step is the assessment of a patient’s pain
and its nature, frequency, severity, and effect on quality of life
and other activities. Patients who have intermittent (eg, episodes once a year or less), uncomplicated episodes with full
function between episodes are probably better off without
potentially injurious interventions. Regardless of the severity
of pain, all patients with chronic pancreatitis should be counseled during each visit about abstinence from not only alcohol
but also tobacco use.
Patients who have more signiﬁcant, frequent, or severe
pain and a tendency to take narcotics for pain control need
further evaluation. The initial evaluation with imaging studies
(eg, CT) should be undertaken to rule out complications of
pancreatitis such as persistent acute inﬂammation (inﬂammatory mass) in the pancreas, pancreatic and peripancreatic ﬂuid
collections, biliary obstruction, and duodenal stenosis. Other
diagnoses to be considered in the appropriate clinical context
are peptic ulcer disease, gallbladder disease, and pancreatic
cancer. The presence of any of these should lead to appropriate intervention.
In patients without the above conditions, medical, endoscopic, and surgical options have been attempted. Medical
therapy includes a low fat diet with abstinence from alcohol
and use of high-dose pancreatic enzymes in association with
acid suppression. Endoscopic therapy includes sphincterotomy, lithotripsy, and pancreatic duct stenting. Currently, the
evidence supporting the use of endoscopic therapy for pain in
chronic pancreatitis is preliminary and largely from shortterm focused observations. Although these procedures may
hold promise, they need to be evaluated further in clinical
trials. Celiac plexus block appears to have limited beneﬁt in
chronic pancreatitis.
Surgical therapy is an option for patients who clearly appear
to have pancreas-related pain. The choice of operation, if
elected, should be based on the morphology of the pancreatic
duct. Treatment options include decompressive surgery such
as lateral pancreaticojejunostomy for patients with a dilated
(>6 mm) pancreatic duct, partial pancreatic resection for
those with a persistent inﬂammatory mass, or total pancreatectomy for patients with disease unresponsive to medical therapy and not suitable for other surgical options. A recent

37 Chronic Pancreatitis

randomized controlled trial comparing pancreaticojejunostomy and endoscopic therapy for chronic pancreatitis with
dilated ducts showed that surgery provided superior results,
with a higher proportion of patients reporting pain relief.
However, the 20% to 40% failure rate mentioned in even the
most enthusiastic reports and the potential for surgical morbidity and mortality warrant reserving surgical treatment for
patients who have severe pain not responsive to lesser tactics.

Pancreatic Neoplasms
Randall K. Pearson, MD

Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinomaa

Almost uniformly, cancer of the pancreas is fatal and is
increasingly a health problem. In the United States, the calculated incidence of pancreatic cancer in 2008 was 37,700,
with 34,300 deaths due to the disease. The overall survival
rate for persons with pancreatic cancer is less than 5%, the
lowest 5-year survival rate of any cancer. This is due partly
to the low resectability rate. Advanced age is the most common risk factor for pancreatic cancer, and as the population
ages, the incidence of pancreatic cancer is predicted to
increase.
Only 10% to 15% of patients are candidates for curative
resection (stage I and stage II disease), and more than 50%
have unresectable stage IV disease with distant metastases
(Table 38.1).
Risk Factors for Development of Pancreatic
Cancer

Early diagnosis of pancreatic cancer is uncommon and the
tumor most often is detected at a late stage, when surgical
resection is not possible. The causes of pancreatic cancer are
unknown, and few environmental risk factors have been convincingly implicated.

at onset of pancreatic cancer by 10 years. Persons working in
the chemical, petrochemical, or rubber industries and hairdressers have a greater risk of pancreatic cancer, which may be
related to exposure to aromatic amines.
Moderate intake of alcohol, high fat diets, long-standing
diabetes mellitus, coffee or caffeine intake, and use of aspirin
have all been proposed to contribute to the risk of pancreatic
cancer, but the evidence is limited or conﬂicting.
Hereditary Pancreatitis

Two mutations of the trypsinogen gene have been described in
hereditary pancreatitis. There is a high incidence of pancreatic
cancer among patients with hereditary pancreatitis, but this
likely is due to the duration of chronic pancreatitis rather than
being related speciﬁcally to the gene mutation. The estimated
cumulative risk of pancreatic cancer at age 70 years is 40%
(70- to 100-fold increased relative risk). Possibly in the future,
methods will be available for identifying patients at risk for
pancreatic cancer, but currently no established screening techniques have proven value.
Chronic Pancreatitis

According to a multinational study, patients with chronic
pancreatitis have a cumulative risk of 2% per decade and a
relative risk (the ratio of observed-to-expected cases) of 16 for
pancreatic cancer. However, chronic pancreatitis is relatively
uncommon and does not contribute signiﬁcantly to the population of patients with pancreatic cancer.
Intraductal Papillary Mucinous Tumors

This disease was recognized ﬁrst in Japan in 1982 and increasingly is recognized in the United States. At Mayo Clinic,
this condition has been identiﬁed in more than 100 patients.
In about 25% to 50% of patients, invasive cancer is found
at surgery (in some patients, it is not suspected preoperatively). Therefore, intraductal papillary mucinous tumor is
a premalignant lesion, and surgical excision at presentation
is the treatment of choice. (See below “Cystic Pancreatic
Tumors.”)
Diabetes Mellitus

More than 50% of patients who present with pancreatic cancer
have diabetes mellitus, and in most patients, diabetes is diagnosed within 2 years of the diagnosis of cancer. Some but not
all the patients are insulin-dependent, and in some, diabetes is
diagnosed at the same time as pancreatic cancer. The development of diabetes mellitus appears to be due to an insulin resistance state induced by the cancer; cases of reversal of diabetes
after Whipple resection have been reported. The precise risk
of pancreatic cancer in patients with new-onset diabetes is not
well deﬁned.

Inheritance

The evidence is consistent that 6% to 8% of patients who present with pancreatic cancer have a family history of pancreatic
cancer in a ﬁrst-degree relative. Families with two or more
ﬁrst-degree relatives with pancreatic cancer have an increased
relative risk of 18- to 57-fold, depending on the number and
ages of the relatives affected. Also, well-deﬁned syndromes are
associated with an increased incidence of pancreatic cancer,
including Peutz-Jeghers syndrome (STK11), mismatch repair
genes (HNPCC), and familial atypical multiple mole melanoma syndrome (p16). Rare kindreds have been identiﬁed in
whom the pancreatic cancer appears to be inherited in an
autosomal dominant manner. Germline BRCA2 mutations
account for approximately 20% of these families and currently
are the most common known inherited predisposition to pancreatic cancer.
It is not known at what age screening should begin or
indeed whether any screening technique can detect early pancreatic cancer or improve prognosis. General guidelines
include performing contrast-enhanced multidetector computed tomography (CT) or endoscopic ultrasonography at
regular intervals, but there are no data to support this recommendation. Tumor markers, including K-ras and CA19-9, are
too insensitive and nonspeciﬁc.
Pathology

About 70% of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas occur in the
head of the pancreas. Histologically, the neoplasms may vary
from well-differentiated tumors that exhibit glandular structures in a dense stroma to poorly differentiated tumors that
exhibit little or no glandular structure or stroma. Lymphatic
spread appears to occur earlier than vascular invasion, which
is present in more advanced lesions. Metastatic disease occurs
mainly to the liver and lungs but also to the adrenals, kidneys,
bone, brain, and skin.
Diagnosis

Patients with pancreatic cancer usually present with symptoms of pain, jaundice, weight loss (with or without anorexia),
and early satiety. The most common symptom is abdominal
pain, which occurs in up to 80% of patients. The presence of
pain, particularly pain radiating through to the back, is associated with advanced lesions with a poor prognosis, the implication being that the tumor has spread beyond the pancreas.
Jaundice is the second most common presentation and
occurs in about 50% of patients. For patients with cancer of
the head of the pancreas, painless jaundice is the symptom
most frequently predictive of resectability.
Overt steatorrhea is a far less common presenting symptom, even in patients with overt weight loss, and, when present alone, it has been associated with longer survival. An
important small percentage of patients (approximately 5%)
present with otherwise unexplained acute pancreatitis.

38 Pancreatic Neoplasms

Tumor Markers for Diagnosis

Various tumor markers are increased in pancreatic cancer, but
all lack sufﬁcient sensitivity and speciﬁcity to be used as either
diagnostic or screening tests. CA19-9 has the greatest sensitivity (about 70%) and speciﬁcity (about 87%) when the cutoff
value is 70 U/mL. If a lower cutoff value is used, sensitivity is
higher, without much effect on speciﬁcity. However, the test is
not useful if the biliary tract is obstructed, because even benign
biliary tract obstruction can cause a marked increase in CA19-9
levels. Approximately 5% to 10% of the population do not
express Lewis antigens; thus, CA19-9 would not be detectable
in this subgroup, further compromising the test for general
screening. Also, CA19-9 levels are more likely to increase as
the disease advances and becomes metastatic. For early-stage
or resectable pancreatic cancer (stages I and II), the sensitivity
of an increased CA19-9 value is reported to be as low as 50%,
missing one-half of the patients with disease at the stage
appropriate for presymptomatic screening.
Genetic markers are present in patients with pancreatic
cancer. The most common of these are the K-ras mutation in
90% of patients, p53 tumor cell suppressor gene in 50% to
70%, and reduced expression of the DCC gene in about 50%.
Other gene deletions are less common.
Although the K-ras mutation can be detected in pancreatic
or duodenal juice or stool from patients with pancreatic
cancer, it is present less frequently than in the tumor itself and,
thus, is not a useful test because of low sensitivity. Furthermore,
lack of speciﬁcity is an important issue because K-ras can be
detected in chronic pancreatitis.

419

identifying small tumors and in performing ﬁne-needle aspiration of the primary tumor or lymph nodes. Although endoscopic ultrasonographically guided ﬁne-needle aspiration is a
safe and effective method to diagnose pancreatic cancer, we
rarely perform ﬁne-needle aspiration in patients with evidence
of resectable pancreatic cancer because the results do not affect
our clinical decision to proceed with surgery. Thus, the role
for endoscopic ultrasonography ﬁne-needle aspiration is limited mainly to patients with unresectable lesions, and whether
it should be performed needs to be balanced against obtaining
histologic material by percutaneous biopsy assisted by either
ultrasonography or CT.
Staging Pancreatic Tumors

CT should be the initial test not only for diagnosis but also for
staging of pancreatic cancer because it may provide evidence
of distant metastases or clear vascular involvement, making
further staging unnecessary (Fig. 38.1 and 38.2). On contrastenhanced multidetector CT images, ductal adenocarcinoma
typically appears as an irregular, hypodense lesion. Magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) may be as accurate as multidetector
CT, but generally it is not as readily available and there is not
the same expertise in interpreting the ﬁndings. Endoscopic
ultrasonography may be the most accurate method for staging
local extent (T staging) (Fig. 38.3) and nodal status (N staging). Correct interpretation of both CT and endoscopic ultrasonographic images regarding resectability varies depending
on the study. For endoscopic ultrasonography, operator experience and the size of the tumor are important variables.
Speciﬁcally, the area of interest relative to vascular invasion

Imaging Testing for Diagnosis

Multidetector CT with arterial and portal venous phase contrast enhancement (“pancreas protocol CT”) should be the
primary imaging study for the evaluation of patients with
symptoms suggestive of pancreatic cancer. It is the appropriate study because it is not only diagnostic but it also can be
used to stage the tumor. The increase in sensitivity (about
85%) of dual-phase multidetector CT is an important improvement over the ability of conventional CT (about 50%–60%) to
diagnose pancreatic tumors. This sometimes leads to misconceptions about the role of dual-phase CT when researching
the older literature about the importance of CT in diagnosis.
For tumors smaller than 15 mm in diameter, however, the
sensitivity of multidetector CT probably is still less than 80%.
Most studies would support a role for endoscopic ultrasonography in the setting of a small cancer not detected with
multidetector CT. The sensitivity of endoscopic ultrasonography for identifying a pancreatic mass is reported to be as high
as 97%. Endoscopic ultrasonography has been described as
the most accurate imaging test for diagnosing pancreatic
cancer, being more accurate than transabdominal ultrasonography or CT. However, multidetector CT with pancreas
protocol contrast enhancement has “altered the equation,”
and currently the role of endoscopic ultrasonography is in

in the body of the pancreas (arrow). Primary pancreatic
adenocarcinoma is usually hypoattenuating. This lesion would also
be consistent with an islet cell tumor. The right kidney is absent.
This lesion is a metastatic renal cell carcinoma.

requires imaging through the entire extent of the tumor, and
with current equipment (either radial or curved linear scanning transducers), resolution progressively deteriorates with
increasing depth of imaging. Whether advances in endoscopic
ultrasonographic technology will improve its ability to determine resectability when CT (or MRI) ﬁndings are equivocal is
unclear.
Small liver or peritoneal metastases usually are not seen on
preoperative imaging studies. Some authors have recommended laparoscopy for viewing the liver and peritoneal surfaces preoperatively. About 10% to 15% of patients have these
small metastases. Most centers do not routinely perform laparoscopy during preoperative assessment, but it can be argued
that laparoscopy is indicated when the likelihood of unresectability is high. This would include all patients with cancer of
the pancreatic body or tail, which has a very low chance of
being resected and virtually no chance of cure, or patients with
ascites, which usually is related to peritoneal metastases.

Surgery

Most patients who undergo surgical resection for pancreatic
cancer ultimately die of the disease, but the only chance of
cure, albeit slim, is resection. For this reason, most major centers continue to endorse the surgical approach.
Preoperative biopsy or ﬁne-needle aspiration of a pancreatic mass is not required in most instances because the ﬁndings do not alter the decision to resect. Of the patients who
have the typical clinical presentation and preoperative imaging results, about 95% have pancreatic cancer conﬁrmed at
surgery. The other 5% usually have chronic pancreatitis, but it

is not possible to conﬁdently exclude tumor preoperatively.
Thus, it is appropriate to perform a Whipple procedure.
An important exception to this rule is autoimmune pancreatitis; this condition can mimic the presentation of pancreatic
cancer and has characteristic clinical features that should
alert astute clinicians preoperatively (see Chapter 37, “Chronic
Pancreatitis”). In 10% to 15% of patients, pancreatic cancer
may produce a desmoplastic response and tumor tissue may
be difﬁcult to procure with needle biopsy or ﬁne-needle
aspiration.

38 Pancreatic Neoplasms

If surgical resection is not preceded by laparoscopy, the
surgeon usually examines the peritoneal cavity and its contents carefully for obvious small metastases and then assesses
vascular involvement, which requires mobilization of the
tumor by dissection. The standard operation for pancreatic
cancer is pancreaticoduodenectomy (Whipple procedure),
which involves cholecystectomy and removing a portion of
the stomach (at least antrectomy), the distal bile duct, head of
the pancreas, the duodenum, proximal jejunum, and regional
lymph nodes. Reconstruction with gastrojejunostomy, hepaticojejunostomy, and pancreaticojejunostomy is required.
Results are good and mortality is low when the operation is
performed by an experienced surgeon.
Alternative operations include a pylorus-preserving
Whipple resection, which has become the surgical standard of
care at most centers. This preserves the stomach and is a less
extensive operation. It has been assumed that this operation,
compared with the Whipple procedure, would improve
outcome, especially long-term morbidity related to dumping
syndrome and weight loss.
An extended or radical Whipple resection has been reported
in the Japanese literature to provide better results, but these
results have not been conﬁrmed by studies in the United States
or Europe; indeed, four prospective, randomized trials have
failed to ﬁnd an advantage for the more extensive procedure.
Surgery is the only chance for cure, but the median survival
is only about 18 months and the 5-year survival rate is about
10%. Higher survival rates have been reported, and it appears
that the different rates depend on tumor size (<2 cm), histologic grade, nodal status, and completeness of resection. For
example, patients with tumors smaller than 2 cm have a
reported 5-year survival rate of 20%, compared with only 1%
for patients with tumors larger than 3 cm. The hypothesis that
surgical treatment of early pancreatic cancer improves prognosis is based on these data.
At presentation, most patients have pancreatic cancer that
is unresectable because of distant metastases or local extension. Because biliary obstruction can be relieved with endoscopic stenting, surgical management of biliary obstruction
usually is limited to patients with a concomitant gastric outlet
obstruction. Biliary diversion is achieved by cholecystenterostomy (but only when the cystic duct enters the common bile
duct at a distance from the tumor) or by choledochoenterostomy. Because duodenal obstruction develops in less than
20% of patients before they die, it is our policy—and that of
nearly all centers—not to perform prophylactic gastrojejunostomy. In some patients, neuropathy due to inﬁltration of the
plexus by tumor, and not obstruction, may cause vomiting
and slow gastric emptying; thus, a drainage procedure will not
be helpful in these patients. Most patients who have jaundice
and unresectable pancreatic cancer should have endoscopic
stent placement. An expandable metal stent is the preferred
endoscopic prosthesis for palliation because it is less likely
to become occluded than plastic stents. This is especially true
for patients with a life expectancy exceeding 3 months.
Percutaneous transhepatic stenting has a lower success rate

421

and a higher 30-day mortality rate and is not the procedure of
choice. According to recent reports and our experience, endoscopically placed expandable metal prostheses can successfully
alleviate gastric outlet or duodenal malignant obstruction, but
these new procedures require further evaluation before they
can be recommended for routine use.
Palliation of pain is a major problem in pancreatic cancer.
Chemical intraoperative splanchnicectomy or celiac plexus
block performed percutaneously or with endoscopic ultrasonography reportedly has reduced pain markedly. The
advantage of plexus block is that it produces fewer complications related to narcotic use, namely, constipation, nausea,
and vomiting. However, a randomized controlled trial that
compared percutaneous celiac block with oral pharmacologic
therapy showed no difference in survival. Still, there was
improved control of pain with less narcotic use, especially
shortly after the nerve block.
If oral analgesia is used to control pancreatic cancer pain,
the type and dose of medication should depend on the severity
of pain. For example, mild pain may be controlled with an
acetaminophen (325 mg)-oxycodone (5 mg) combination,
one or two tablets every 4 to 6 hours, whereas more severe
pain may require a slow-release morphine compound, usually
starting at a dose of 30 mg twice daily and increasing to a dose
as high as 600 mg twice daily to achieve control. A short-acting
liquid morphine compound may be useful to control breakthrough pain. Alternatively, a fentanyl (Duragesic) patch,
25 to 100 mg per hour, is effective for some patients.
Exocrine Pancreatic Insufﬁciency

Patients with cancer of the pancreatic head who have weight
loss and stools suggestive of malabsorption should receive
treatment with pancreatic enzymes. Available data suggest
that pancreatic steatorrhea can be corrected with pancreatic
replacement therapy.
Chemotherapy

No single or combination chemotherapy is highly effective
for pancreatic cancer. Only 5-ﬂuorouracil and gemcitabine
have been associated with survival longer than 5 months.
5-Fluorouracil has been administered as a bolus or short-term
continuous infusion or protracted infusion. However, protracted infusion of 5-ﬂuorouracil in combination with other
chemotherapeutic agents does not appear to be advantageous.
Gemcitabine has a low objective response rate and, compared
with 5-ﬂuorouracil, a small statistically signiﬁcant improvement in overall survival (5.7 vs 4.4 months). One-year survival
with gemcitabine treatment is 18%, compared with 2% for
5-ﬂuorouracil. Because of this outcome, gemcitabine has been,
for more than a decade, the drug of choice for palliative treatment of advanced pancreatic cancer.
Many other combination therapies have been studied, with
nearly always disappointing results. Recently, the combination of gemcitabine with erlotinib, a small molecule inhibitor

422

Section VII Pancreas and Biliary Tree

of epidermal growth factor, demonstrated a small but
statistically signiﬁcant improvement in survival. This combination has now been approved by the US Food and Drug
Administration.
Combinations of gemcitabine and a platinum agent or
ﬂuorpyrimidine have been studied frequently, and a metaanalysis has suggested they have beneﬁt for patients who have
minimal symptoms related to advanced disease and excellent
performance status.
Radiotherapy

Radiation is used in two situations. 1) It is used as adjuvant
therapy after resection for cure. Until recently, the only randomized trial showed that radiotherapy in combination with
5-ﬂuorouracil had a 2-year actuarial survival rate of 43% compared with an 18% rate for the control group (resection only).
However, a recently published European study found no signiﬁcant advantage for radiotherapy. Although this was the
largest randomized trial in the postsurgical adjuvant setting
(n=541), design ﬂaws of the study led to serious criticism and
limited adoption of its conclusion. External beam radiation
with 5-ﬂuorouracil is the standard of care for adjuvant therapy
in most US centers. 2) In unresectable locoregional pancreatic
cancer, combined chemoradiation therapy, with 5-ﬂuorouracil
and radiation, has been shown to be superior to radiation
alone, with a median survival of 42 weeks vs 23 weeks.

Cystic Pancreatic Tumors
Serous Cystadenoma

Classically, the presentation of these tumors is described as
large, sometimes palpable, asymptomatic upper abdominal
masses, but in our experience, they more frequently are small
lesions in the head, body, or tail of the pancreas that are
discovered incidentally on imaging studies (Fig. 38.4). They
occur equally in males and females and constitute up to 10%
of all cystic lesions of the pancreas. Histologically, the tumors
consist of multiple tiny cysts that contain watery ﬂuid. When
observed on imaging studies, the grape-like clustering of small
cysts led to the name “microscopic” to describe serous cystadenomas. Their cut surface shows a typical stellate scar (which
is also evident on imaging). The malignant potential is almost
zero (only a few case reports of malignancy have been published), and in elderly asymptomatic patients, these tumors
frequently are only observed.
Mucinous Cystadenoma and
Cystadenocarcinoma

These tumors occur almost exclusively in women 40 to
60 years old. They account for 1% to 2% of all pancreatic
exocrine tumors. Foci of malignancy in many of the cysts
and reports of patients with ostensibly benign resected

Figure 38.4 Computed tomogram showing a serous cyst. The mass

lesion in the head of the pancreas consists of multiple small cystic
lesions (arrow). The ﬁndings are typical of serous cystadenoma.

cystadenomas later presenting with metastatic disease have led
to the concept that these lesions have a moderate malignant
potential. Recent surgical series have shown the importance of
size: mucinous cystadenomas smaller than 5 cm have a low
potential for harboring invasive cancer. The tumors consist of
multiple cysts (larger than those in serous cystadenomas and
sometimes referred to as “macrocystic”) containing sticky
mucus. As with serous cystadenomas, these lesions are often
identiﬁed as a small cystic lesion in patients having CT for
another reason.
Intraductal Papillary Mucinous Tumor

This group of tumors, originally described in Japan, consists
of intraductal papillary growth of mucin-producing columnar
epithelium. These changes can occur in the main pancreatic
duct or in side ducts and may involve a small portion of the
pancreas or the entire gland. As a consequence of these
changes, obstructive pancreatitis frequently occurs, with atrophy of the gland. Malignant transformation of the papillary
growth has occurred in up to 30% to 50% of patients at the
time of diagnosis, when the main pancreatic duct is involved.
Because of this high rate of invasive cancer in main-duct intraductal papillary mucinous tumor, surgical resection is recommended. Early diagnosis is essential; once invasive cancer
develops, one-half of the patients will have local or distant
metastases at the time of surgical resection. The malignant
potential of side-branch intraductal papillary mucinous tumor
appears to be much lower, and the long-term risk is unknown.
When to recommend surgical resection (especially when a
Whipple resection is required) is difﬁcult.

38 Pancreatic Neoplasms

423

Frequent clinical presentations include recurrent episodes
of pancreatitis, abdominal pain, or steatorrhea. Jaundice and
diabetes mellitus are less common. The diagnosis is suspected
when a dilated pancreatic duct or side ducts are seen on CT.
The chief differential diagnosis is chronic pancreatitis. At
endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP),
about one-half of the patients have the diagnostic ﬁnding of a
patulous papilla extruding mucus. Endoscopic ultrasonography may be helpful in making the diagnosis, and with less risk
than ERCP. In addition, endoscopic ultrasonography can help
exclude main-duct involvement and aid the clinician in assessing the risk of malignancy for the patient.

Generally, if the nature of a cyst cannot be determined precisely, the practice is to observe the cyst and to perform imaging studies at regular intervals to ensure that it is not rapidly
increasing in size. Many of these incidentally found cysts meet
the clinical and imaging criteria for branch-duct intraductal
papillary mucinous tumor. Recently, an international consensus on management was published and recommended careful
follow-up with imaging for asymptomatic peripheral cysts
3 cm or smaller.

Solid-Cystic (Papillary-Cystic) Tumor

Jonathan E. Clain, MD, is gratefully acknowledged as author
of this chapter in the ﬁrst edition of the book (parts of which
appear in this edition).

This tumor, which has various names, has a striking female
predominance and usually occurs in adolescence. The histogenesis is unclear, but histologically, pseudopapillary and
microcystic changes are seen. Most patients present with
abdominal pain. The treatment for these often large tumors is
excision. The prognosis is good, and most of the tumors can
be considered benign, but occasionally metastatic disease
occurs.
Approach to Small, Incidentally Observed
Cystic Tumors of the Pancreas

When cystic tumors of the pancreas are small, CT and ultrasonography may not be able to resolve the nature of the
cyst. The differential diagnosis includes benign congenital
cysts, small pseudocysts, intraductal papillary mucinous
tumor (especially branch duct), mucinous cystadenoma,
serous cystadenoma, and degenerating endocrine or ductal
adenocarcinomas. Endoscopic ultrasonography has an important role in deﬁning its structure. For example, what may
appear to be a unilocular simple cyst on CT may be seen on
endoscopic ultrasonography to be a complex cyst with septations. Although aspiration of the cyst is a simple procedure, it
is not clear whether analysis of the cystic ﬂuid for carcinoembryonic antigen or mucin and cytologic examination for
malignancy alter the decisions about management for most
patients.

Gallstonesa
Ferga C. Gleeson, MB, BCh

Autopsies performed on Egyptian and Chinese mummies
demonstrate that gallstones afﬂicted humans more than 3,500
years ago. The prevalence of gallstones varies widely and is as
high as 60% to 70% among American Indians and 10% to
15% among white adults of developed countries. The prevalence is less among black Americans, East Asians, and people
from sub-Saharan Africa. In the United States, gallstone disease is one of the most common and costly digestive diseases
that requires hospitalization. The estimated annual direct cost
is $6.2 billion. It is newly diagnosed in more than 1 million
people annually, and approximately 700,000 cholecystectomies are performed each year. Therefore, an understanding of
the anatomy and physiology, clinical presentation, and efﬁcient approaches to investigations and management of gallstone disease are important. Optimal clinical management
varies considerably, depending on the presentation.a

Anatomy and Physiology
Gallbladder and Cystic Duct Anatomy

The gallbladder is a piriform sac situated primarily in the
cystic fossa on the posteroinferior aspect of the right hepatic
lobe. It develops from the cystic portion of the hepatic diverticulum. The neck of the gallbladder is connected to the cystic
duct, which is 3 to 4 cm long, eventually joining the common
hepatic duct to form the common bile duct. The cystic duct
has ﬁve to twelve oblique folds that create the spiral valve
of Heister. The cystic artery, usually a branch from the right
hepatic artery, courses superior to the cystic duct and reaches
the superior aspect of the neck, where it divides into superﬁcial and deep branches. Anatomical variations include gallbladder agenesis, multiple gallbladders, bilobed gallbladder,
and double cystic duct. In double gallbladder, each gallbladder
may have its own cystic duct or the duct may join to form a
common cystic duct before joining the common hepatic duct.

The major components of bile are water and organic and inorganic solutes. The organic solutes include miscellaneous proteins, bilirubin, bile acids, and biliary lipids. Bilirubin is a
degradation product of heme and usually is present as conjugated water-soluble diglucuronide. The unconjugated form of
bilirubin precipitates, contributing to pigment or mixed cholesterol stones. Bile acids are bipolar water-soluble molecules
synthesized from cholesterol. When the level of bile acids is
above the critical micellar concentration, bile acids selfassociate to form micelles capable of solubilizing hydrophobic
lipid molecules in bile or intestinal chyme. The primary function of micelles is to facilitate fat digestion and absorption.
The primary bile acids (cholic and chenodeoxycholic acids)
are manufactured in the liver. They are converted to secondary
425

426

Section VII Pancreas and Biliary Tree

bile acids (deoxycholic and lithocholic acids) by bacteria in
the gut. The major biliary lipids, cholesterol and lecithin
(phospholipid), are insoluble in water. They are secreted into
bile as lipid vesicles and are carried in both vesicles and mixed
micelles.
In health, the gallbladder concentrates bile tenfold for efﬁcient storage during fasting. Intraduodenal protein and fat
release cholecystokinin, which stimulates contraction of the
gallbladder, relaxation of the sphincter of Oddi, and ﬂow of
bile to the intestine. More than 90% of bile acids are actively
absorbed in the terminal ileum. This enterohepatic circulation
cycles 4 to 12 times daily, slowing during fasting and accelerating greatly after a meal (Fig. 39.1).

Gallstone Pathogenesis and Epidemiology

Gallstones are categorized on the basis of composition as cholesterol gallstones (80% of patients) and pigment (black and
brown) gallstones (20%). Each category has a unique structural, epidemiologic, and risk factor proﬁle (Table 39.1).

Systemic
circulation

Cholesterol crystal formation requires the presence of one
or more of the following: cholesterol supersaturation, accelerated nucleation, or gallbladder hypomotility and bile stasis.
Cholesterol gallstones contain a mixture of cholesterol
(50%–99% by weight), a glycoprotein matrix, and small
amounts of calcium and bilirubin. Cholesterol supersaturation can result from deﬁcient secretion of bile acid or hypersecretion of cholesterol. Bile acid secretion may be diminished
because of decreased synthesis, as occurs with age or liver disease, or because of decreased enterohepatic circulation, as
occurs with motor disorders, hormonal defects, and increased
gastrointestinal losses from bile acid sequestrant therapy or
terminal ileal disease, resection, or bypass. Cholesterol secretion increases with hormonal stimuli (female gender, pregnancy, exogenous estrogens, and progestins), obesity,
hyperlipidemia, age, chronic liver disease, and sometimes with
excessive dietary polyunsaturated fats or increased caloric
intake. In a supersaturated environment, the initial formation
of gallstone crystals is the result of an excess of nucleating vs
antinucleating effects of the various proteins in bile (Fig. 39.2
and Table 39.2).

hepatic synthesis of bile acids is equivalent to enteric losses. (Adapted from Zucker SD, Gollan JL. Physiology of the liver. In: Haubrich WS,

Abbreviations: ATP, adenosine triphosphate; HDL, high-density lipoprotein; VLDL,
very low-density lipoprotein.

Gallbladder dysmotility results in inadequate clearance of
crystals and nascent stones. Motility is decreased in the presence of supersaturated bile even before stone formation.
Decreased motility is a dominant contributing factor to stone
development during pregnancy, prolonged total parenteral
nutrition, somatostatin therapy, or somatostatinoma.
The prevalence of cholesterol gallstones varies with geography and ethnicity. They are rare in populations of Africa and
most of Asia, are common in most Western populations
(15%–20% of women, 5%–10% of men), and occur almost
uniformly in North and South American Indians (70%–90%
of women). For all populations, the prevalence increases with
age and is approximately twice as high in women as in men.
Generally, pigment gallstones are formed by the precipitation of bilirubin in bile. Black pigment gallstones are formed
in sterile gallbladder bile in association with chronic hemolytic states, cirrhosis, Gilbert’s syndrome, or cystic ﬁbrosis or
they may have no identiﬁable cause. These stones are small,
irregular, dense, and insoluble aggregates or polymers of calcium bilirubinate. Brown pigment gallstones occur primarily
in the bile ducts, where they are related to stasis and chronic
bacterial colonization, as may occur above strictures or duodenal diverticula, following sphincterotomy, or in association
with biliary parasites. Brown pigment gallstones are composed
of 10% to 30% cholesterol. They are softer than black pigment
gallstones and may soften or disaggregate with cholesterol
solvents.

Clinical Presentation and Complications
Cholelithiasis

Frequently, the diagnosis of asymptomatic cholelithiasis is the
result of diagnosed widespread access to and use of abdominal
ultrasonography to evaluate nonspeciﬁc abdominal symptoms.
Approximately 10% to 20% of the population of Western

countries have cholelithiasis, and of these, 50% to 70% are
asymptomatic when initially identiﬁed. Commonly, asymptomatic disease has a benign course, and the proportion of
those with disease that evolves from asymptomatic to symptomatic is relatively low (10%–25%). When gallstones eventually become symptomatic, only 2% to 3% of patients present
initially with acute cholecystitis or other complications.
Asymptomatic stones generally do not require therapy.
However, prophylactic cholecystectomy should be considered for patients who are planning extensive travel in remote
areas and for American Indian populations, in whom the relative risk for stone-associated gallbladder carcinoma is 20 times
higher than for those without stones. Patients with midgut
carcinoid tumors are treated commonly with somatostatin
analogues. The adverse effects of these analogues include
impairment of gallbladder function, formation of gallstones,
and cholecystitis. Therefore, prophylactic cholecystectomy
may be beneﬁcial for this cohort of patients. Concomitant
cholecystectomy at the time of a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass for
ultrasound-conﬁrmed gallbladder pathology is feasible and
safe and may reduce the potential for future gallbladderrelated morbidity. A similar rationale may be used when prophylactic splenectomy is performed in the setting of hereditary
spherocytosis. Cholecystectomy is not recommended for
patients with asymptomatic stones who have diabetes mellitus
or sickle cell disease if they have access to medical care.
Progressive gallstone dissolution by oral litholysis with hydrophilic ursodeoxycholic acid may be attempted in patients who
have mild symptoms and small, uncalciﬁed cholesterol gallstones in a functioning gallbladder with a patent cystic duct.
Biliary colic is a relatively speciﬁc form of pain secondary
to increased intragallbladder pressure due to hormonal or
neural stimulation. This may be triggered by a fatty meal or a
stone compressed against the gallbladder outlet or cystic duct
opening. The pain usually develops rapidly in the epigastrium
or right upper quadrant and lasts longer than 15 minutes but
not longer than 4 to 6 hours. The likelihood of patients experiencing a severe event or complication is approximately 1%
per year, prompting the recommendation for surgical therapy
of symptomatic gallstones. Histologically, most patients with
recurrent biliary colic have chronic cholecystitis.
Cholecystitis is a syndrome that encompasses a continuum
of clinicopathologic states. One end of this continuum is
chronic cholecystitis, with intermittent episodes of biliary
colic. The other end is acute cholecystitis, for which abdominal pain lasts longer and is accompanied by fever, leukocytosis, or cholestasis. Acute cholecystitis is associated with age
older than 60 years, male gender, diabetes, history of cardiovascular disease, and a history of cerebrovascular accident.
Therefore, early cholecystectomy is recommended for patients
who have symptomatic cholelithiasis and these adverse risk
factors. However, cholecystectomy is not indicated for patients
who have isolated liver biochemistry abnormalities or cholestasis in the absence of choledocholithiasis.
Acute acalculous cholecystitis is associated with a high
mortality rate and is difﬁcult to diagnose. It generally occurs

39 Gallstones

in acutely ill, hospitalized patients. It also may develop postoperatively and in critically ill patients and may be complicated by the development of gangrene, perforation, and
empyema. Diabetes mellitus, malignant disease, abdominal
vasculitis, congestive heart failure, cholesterol embolization,
shock, and cardiac arrest also have been associated with acute
acalculous cholecystitis. Ultrasonography, computed tomography (CT), and hepatobiliary iminodiacetic acid (HIDA)
scans are the most useful imaging examinations. Diagnostic
laparoscopy and, potentially, laparotomy have been recommended by the Society of American Gastroenterological and
Endoscopic Surgeons for acute acalculous cholecystitis.
As many as one-third of all laparoscopic cholecystectomy
procedures are complicated by dropped gallstones. Gallstones
also may be dropped during open cholecystectomy, but the larger
operating ﬁeld makes them easier to retrieve. Dropped gallstones
may mimic colon cancer, liver abscess, subphrenic abscess, peritoneal metastases, and intra-abdominal actinomycosis.
Gallbladder Polyps

Polypoid lesions of the gallbladder typically are incidental
ﬁndings and represent any projection of mucosa into the gallbladder lumen regardless of neoplastic potential. The majority
are benign nonneoplastic lesions that include cholesterol
polyps (usually pedunculated), adenomyomatosis, and inﬂammatory polyps. Cholesterol polyps are usually smaller than
10 mm in diameter and appear on ultrasonography as tiny
echogenic spots or echogenic pedunculated masses without
acoustic shadowing. Patients with a congenital polyposis syndrome such as Peutz-Jeghers syndrome or Gardner’s syndrome can also develop gallbladder polyps. Solitary sessile
polyps larger than 10 mm in diameter in patients older than
50 years should be considered for cholecystectomy, as should
polyps in patients who have cholelithiasis or primary sclerosing cholangitis.
Gallstones and Pregnancy

Symptomatic gallstone disease is the second most common
abdominal emergency in pregnant women. Insulin resistance
is a risk factor for incidental gallbladder sludge and stones
during pregnancy, even after adjustment for the body mass
index. Insulin resistance might represent a causal link between
obesity and gallstones. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) can be performed safely during pregnancy but may be associated with an increased rate of
post-ERCP pancreatitis, compared with the general population. Studies that compared conservative with surgical management of cholecystitis found no signiﬁcant difference in the
incidence of preterm delivery or fetal mortality. Laparoscopic
cholecystectomy is safe in all trimesters. In 12 reports of gallstone pancreatitis, the fetal mortality rate was 8% for the conservative management group and 2.6% for the surgical
management group, suggesting the need for earlier surgical
intervention. Hospitalization for gallstone-related disease is

429

common in the ﬁrst year postpartum, most commonly for
uncomplicated cholelithiasis. Risk factors for hospitalization
include the prepregnancy body mass index, Latino ethnicity,
and maternal age.
Microlithiasis and Sludge

Microliths are a component of biliary sludge, consisting of
relatively larger particles (1–3 mm) that are an essential step in
the development of gallstones. Microscopic examination of
bile under polarized light can detect cholesterol crystals, which
are a surrogate marker for biliary sludge and gallstones. The
chemical composition of sludge includes cholesterol monohydrate crystals, calcium bilirubinate granules, calcium phosphate and calcium carbonate crystals, and calcium salts of
fatty acids and correlates well with the composition of stones.
A higher prevalence of detectable gallbladder sludge is noted
during pregnancy, total parenteral nutrition, weight loss,
biliary stasis, and after the intravenous administration of
ceftriaxone.
Biliary sludge or microlithiasis may cause acalculous biliary
pain and may obstruct the common bile duct, presenting as
acute cholangitis or pancreatitis. Consequently, occult microlithiasis should be suspected when patients have acute pancreatitis of unknown origin, particularly if relapses are
frequent. It is a well-recognized complication following liver
transplantation, in which 6% of cholangiographies show
biliary ﬁlling defects ultimately attributed to sludge-cast,
gallstones, or necrotic debris. The formation of biliary sludge
is a serious complication, one that is life-threatening. Biliary
strictures and prestenotic dilatations of the bile ducts are the
major reasons for sludge formation.
Expectant management is warranted for incidentally
detected asymptomatic sludge. Similar to that for overt gallstone disease, treatment is necessary only if patients are symptomatic or have complications. Endoscopic sphincterotomy
with either ursodeoxycholic acid treatment or laparoscopic
cholecystectomy is a useful alternative for patients who have
biliary sludge and recurrent obstruction of biliary outﬂow
associated with recurrent cholangitis or pancreatitis. After
liver transplantation, biliary sludge should be treated endoscopically.
Choledocholithiasis

Choledocholithiasis should be suspected in patients who have
symptomatic cholelithiasis or acute biliary pancreatitis and
possibly in postcholecystectomy patients. Choledocholithiasis
occurs in 10% to 15% of people who have cholelithiasis.
Concomitant cholelithiasis and choledocholithiasis occur
more frequently in elderly Asian patients, in patients with
chronic bile duct inﬂammation (sclerosing cholangitis or parasitic infestation), and in those with hypothyroidism. A
common duct stone detected on ultrasonography is the
most reliable predictor of such stones at ERCP or surgery. The
speciﬁcity of ultrasonography for common bile duct stones

is high (Fig. 39.3). Combination therapy consisting of endoscopic biliary sphincterotomy and biliary drainage as initial
treatment for patients with moderate acute cholangitis is safe
and should not prolong hospitalization. Extracorporeal shock
wave lithotripsy of duct stones is clinically approved and feasible, although infrequently used. It is coupled with ERCP for
the removal of stone debris.
Bile duct stones recur in about 4% to 24% of patients
during follow-up. They may recur after cholecystectomy. This
is thought to be due to bile stasis and bacterobilia. A small
amount of postcholecystectomy syndromes (symptomatic
postcholecystectomy patients) are related to a residual stone
in a particularly long cystic duct or to the relapse of lithiasis in
a gallbladder remnant. Common duct dilation (≥13 mm) and
the presence of a periampullary diverticulum are risk factors
for recurrent stones.
Ascending Cholangitis

Acute cholangitis, or biliary tree infection, occurs as a consequence of biliary tract obstruction that promotes bile stasis
and bacterial growth. Bacteria ascending from the duodenum
is the main bacterial entry route. A secondary and less frequent
route of entry is the portal venous and periportal lymphatic
system. Most episodes are due to coliforms such as Escherichia
coli, Klebsiella (70% of cases), Enterococcus, and anaerobes
(Clostridium and Bacteroides) (10%–15% of cases). The occurrence of bacteremia or endotoxemia correlates directly with
intrabiliary pressure.
Common duct stones are the most common cause, and the
presentation may range from a mild, self-limited process to a
serious, life-threatening condition that requires intervention. It
also may be due to a biliary stricture from a previous biliary
operation, liver transplantation, primary sclerosing cholangitis,

or acquired immunodeﬁciency syndrome-related cholangiopathy. In 1877, Charcot described a triad of fever, right
upper quadrant pain, and jaundice; this triad occurs in 56% to
70% of patients who have cholangitis. Reynold’s pentad, which
includes hypotension and alteration of consciousness in addition to Charcot’s triad, is seen less frequently (5%–7% of
cases).
Initial therapy should include the empiric use of broadspectrum antibiotics with adequate biliary excretion. Useful
antibiotics include ampicillin/sulbactam, piperacillin/tazobactam, third- or fourth-generation cephalosporins, quinolones,
and carbapenems. Elderly patients, patients with a biliary stent
in situ, or those who had previous enterobiliary surgery may
beneﬁt from additional enterococcal and anaerobic antimicrobial coverage. The timing of biliary decompression
depends on the initial response to antibiotics, and supportive
care can be provided by endoscopic, percutaneous, or surgical
approaches or by multimodal therapy. ERCP with nasobiliary
drain placement, stent, or endoscopic sphincterotomy and
common duct clearance is associated with considerably lower
morbidity and mortality than traditional surgical management. If endoscopy fails to achieve access, subsequent percutaneous or surgical decompression should be pursued,
depending on the clinical urgency.
Patients with recurrent pyogenic cholangitis, or oriental
cholangiohepatitis, present with recurrent, progressively
severe, and frequent attacks of cholangitis with associated
extensive stone disease, especially of the intrahepatic ducts.
Secondary duct dilation, stricture formation, and further
stone formation become self-perpetuating. This form of cholangitis occurs especially in the Asian-Paciﬁc basin. The pathogenetic mechanism is not understood completely; however,
postulated causes include primary congenital biliary strictures
and cysts, biliary parasitic infection (Ascaris or Clonorchis),

39 Gallstones

and chronic intrahepatic bacterial colonization from unclear
sources. Therapy is directed at duct decompression, drainage,
stone clearance, and, occasionally, lobar or segmental resection for isolated intrahepatic disease. Isolated unilateral intrahepatic involvement is most common in the left hepatic ductal
system.
Functional Gallbladder Disorder (Gallbladder
Dyskinesia)

The estimated prevalence of biliary-like pain in men and
women with an ultrasonographically normal gallbladder is 8%
and 21%, respectively. Other synonyms include gallbladder
dyskinesia, chronic acalculous gallbladder dysfunction, acalculous biliary disease, and biliary dyskinesia (Table 39.3). Even
though evidence-based recommendations cannot be made,
the use of a neuromodulator is reasonable for those with suspected functional gallbladder disorder. If symptoms persist,
oral cholecystography, with and without cholecystokinin
stimulation and with measurement of the gallbladder ejection
fraction, should be performed. This is the most frequently
used investigation to evaluate functional gallbladder disorder.
If the ejection fraction is less than 35%, cholecystectomy
should be considered but only for patients with classic biliary
symptoms.

Gallstone Complications

The incidence of gallstone pancreatitis is increased for women
older than 60 years. The pathogenesis is thought to be related
to increased pressure within the pancreatic duct, with biliopancreatic reﬂux, due to passage of a common duct stone or an
impacted stone at the level of the papilla. Suspicion of acute gallstone pancreatitis is increased in patients who have acute pancreatitis associated with abnormal liver function tests, evidence
of cholelithiasis, or biliary tree dilatation. Transabdominal
ultrasonography is the most cost-effective initial investigation
to document the presence of cholelithiasis, with or without
Table 39.3

common duct dilation. Bowel gas and stones smaller than
4 mm may reduce the overall sensitivity. Pancreatic parenchymal and peripancreatic inﬂammatory changes are best detected
and evaluated with contrast enhanced CT, which also may
show pancreatic neoplasm, pancreatic calciﬁcation, or choledocholithiasis. Because patients have a high risk of recurrence
within 30 days after an attack, they should undergo cholecystectomy during the index hospitalization, after their symptoms have resolved.
Gallstone ileus is a disease of the elderly, with a female predominance. It frequently is preceded by an episode of acute
cholecystitis. The resulting obstruction is a true mechanical
phenomenon; therefore, the term ileus is a misnomer. The
cholecystitis-related inﬂammation and adhesions facilitate the
erosion of the offending gallstone through the gallbladder
wall, forming a cholecystoenteric ﬁstula and facilitating stone
passage. The duodenal wall is the most common ﬁstula site,
but it may occur anywhere in the gastrointestinal tract (colon,
stomach, and small bowel). An iatrogenic ﬁstula can form
after endoscopic sphincterotomy or a surgical choledochoduodenostomy. A stone smaller than 2 to 2.5 cm usually passes
spontaneously through a normal gastrointestinal tract. Stones
larger than 5 cm are more likely to become impacted. The
terminal ileum and ileocecal valve are the most common locations because of the relatively narrow lumen and decreased
peristalsis. Presenting symptoms may be intermittent, because
the passing stone may lodge at various levels of the bowel. A
passing stone is responsible for 25% of all bowel obstructions
in patients older than 65 years, compared with 1% to 3% when
all age groups are considered. Abdominal radiography may
show bowel obstruction, pneumobilia, and an abnormally
located stone. CT may identify larger stones, evidence of bowel
obstruction, and the level of obstruction. Surgical intervention is the treatment of choice for the majority of patients and
may include biliary surgery at the same time as relieving the
intestinal obstruction.
Obstruction at the level of the gastric outlet by a gallstone
is deﬁned as Bouveret’s syndrome. It is an uncommon form of
gallstone ileus. A single gallstone at least 2.5 cm in diameter is
the most common underlying cause of this syndrome.
Mirizzi’s syndrome describes a common hepatic duct
obstruction due to extrinsic compression from an impacted
cystic duct stone. It is noted in 0.7% to 1.4% of patients undergoing biliary surgery. Occasionally, the cystic duct courses
parallel to the extrahepatic bile duct, inserting medially into it
at the level of the papilla (11% of patients).
Emphysematous cholecystitis is a rare form of acute cholecystitis in which the gallbladder becomes infected with gasforming organisms such as Clostridium perfringens, E coli, and
Klebsiella species. Most patients are between 50 and 70 years
old and, in contrast to typical patients with acute cholecystitis,
men are more likely to be affected than women. Approximately
25% of patients have diabetes mellitus. Although the initial
symptoms may be relatively mild, the disorder often progresses rapidly and is associated with a high risk for gallbladder perforation. The diagnosis can be made with plain

432

Section VII Pancreas and Biliary Tree

abdominal radiographs, ultrasonographic studies, or CT. CT
is the most sensitive method for detecting small amounts of
gas in the gallbladder wall. Treatment includes intravenous
antibiotics that cover anaerobic organisms, followed by early
open or laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Another option is percutaneous drainage of the gallbladder, particularly in patients
who are critically ill. Emphysematous cholecystitis has been
reported in both gallstone cholecystitis and acalculous cholecystitis and has been associated with a mortality rate of
approximately 15%. This is substantially higher than mortality rates of 3% to 4% for acute cholecystitis without gas-forming organisms.
Porcelain gallbladder is seen more frequently in women,
primarily in the sixth decade. It can be identiﬁed on plain
abdominal radiographs or CT and is an uncommon ﬁnding of
chronic cholecystitis. Porcelain gallbladder is characterized by
extensive calciﬁcation manifested as a brittle consistency of
the wall and is seen in less than 1% of cholecystectomy specimens, with stones identiﬁed in 95% of pathology specimens. It
is an important diagnosis because of its association with gallbladder cancer. However, the diagnosis may be difﬁcult
because of rim calciﬁcations noted in the right upper quadrant
that may be due to gallstones or liver, renal, adrenal, or pancreatic cysts. The incidence of gallbladder cancer in cases of
porcelain gallbladder ranges between 0% and 20%.
Prophylactic cholecystectomy is the treatment of choice for
porcelain gallbladder.

Clinical Investigations
Liver Biochemical Testing

Uncomplicated biliary colic usually is not accompanied by
changes in hematologic and biochemical tests. However, the
initial evaluation of suspected stone disease should include
serum liver biochemical testing (eg, alanine aminotransferase
[ALT], aspartate aminotransferase [AST], alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin) and transabdominal ultrasonography of the right upper quadrant. Liver biochemical tests
may be most useful in excluding the presence of common duct
stones. The negative predictive value of completely normal
results on liver biochemical tests in a series of more than 1,000
patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy was more
than 97%, whereas the positive predictive value of any abnormal liver biochemical test result was only 15%, according to
the current guidelines of the American Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy.
Patients with cholangitis or pancreatitis associated with
abnormal results on serum liver function tests are at increased
risk for having bile duct stones. The conventional wisdom that
the alkaline phosphatase level increases more than the AST
level in obstructive jaundice holds true when jaundice is due
to strictures, but in obstructive stone disease, the increase in
AST may equal that in alkaline phosphatase or even exceed it
during maximal jaundice and painful episodes. Occasionally,

serum transaminase levels may be increased dramatically,
mimicking acute viral hepatitis. The increased levels tend to
decrease rapidly over several days with biliary stones rather
than weeks as with acute viral hepatitis.
Biliary Imaging

Several improvements have been made in biliary imaging in
recent years. Although ultrasonography is the primary initial
modality for the evaluation of the biliary tree, the advent of
and improvements in CT, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI),
and endoscopic ultrasonographic (EUS) imaging techniques
have resulted in superior detection and characterization of
disease.
Plain Abdominal Radiography

Plain abdominal radiography can show radiopaque (calciﬁed)
stones and pneumobilia due to a previous biliary sphincterotomy, a biliary-enteric anastomosis or ﬁstula, or an incompetent sphincter, as may occur with duodenal Crohn’s disease,
duodenal diverticulum, or other periampullary disease.
Oral Cholecystography

Oral cholecystography involves standard radiographic imaging of the right upper quadrant after oral administration of an
iodinated radiodense contrast agent. Thus, the agent needs to
be ingested; absorbed, with liver uptake; excreted by the biliary system; and concentrated by the gallbladder. Most gallbladders opacify after a single oral dose and 85% to 90% after
a second or double dose. Nonvisualization of the gallbladder
after a reinforced 1- or 2-day study is 95% predictive of gallbladder disease. The use of oral cholecystography has diminished in clinical practice because it is less sensitive (65%–90%)
than ultrasonography for cholelithiasis and it is not indicated
when acute cholecystitis is suspected. Oral cholecystography
may be useful when ultrasonography fails to image the gallbladder and there is no access to EUS.
Hepatobiliary Iminodiacetic Acid Scanning

HIDA scanning, also known as cholescintigraphy, may be used
to diagnose acute cholecystitis or to conﬁrm intra-abdominal
bile leakage. This method involves noninvasive scanning
of gamma emissions after the intravenous administration,
liver uptake, and biliary excretion of technetium iminodiacetic acid derivatives. The inability to visualize the gallbladder
despite excretion into the common bile duct at 4 hours after
the injection is indicative of cystic duct obstruction.
Nonvisualization of the gallbladder is 97% and 96% sensitive
and speciﬁc, respectively, for acute calculous cholecystitis.
False-negative results occur with acalculous cholecystitis, and
false-positive results occur with chronic cholecystitis and
chronic liver disease and during total parenteral nutrition or
fasting states.

Transabdominal Ultrasonography

Ultrasonography has greater sensitivity for detecting dilatation of the common bile duct than for detecting choledocholithiasis. It is most sensitive (90%–98%) for the detection
of cholelithiasis identiﬁed as mobile, intraluminal, echogenic,
shadowing particles. Cholecystitis is identiﬁed by gallbladder
contraction or marked distention with surrounding ﬂuid
or wall thickening. Gallbladder thickening also may be due
to portal hypertension, ascites, and hypoalbuminemia. The
normal diameter of the common bile duct is 3 to 6 mm and
may increase with advancing age. Biliary obstruction should
be suspected when the diameter is more than 8 mm in a patient
with a gallbladder in situ. Multiple small stones (<5 mm in
diameter), compared with larger stones, increases the risk of
common duct migration fourfold. Transabdominal ultrasonographic examination of the gallbladder permits the visualization of particles in bile, usually those 2 to 3 mm or more
in diameter.
Abdominal Computed Tomography

CT is the best imaging method for the evaluation of possible
complications of biliary stone disease if ultrasonography is
suboptimal, as in patients with fever, right upper quadrant
pain, and associated jaundice. Bowel gas and ribs do not interfere with CT. CT is superior to ultrasonography for obese
patients, in whom imaging is improved by discrete fat planes.
CT is not appropriate for the diagnosis of uncomplicated
stone disease or evaluation of biliary colic because 50% of gallstones are radiolucent on CT.
Endoscopic Ultrasonography
Suspected Choledocholithiasis

The major advantage of EUS in suspected choledocholithiasis,
as compared with transabdominal ultrasonography, is the
ability to position the ultrasound transducer within the duodenal lumen, thereby allowing visualization of the adjacent
biliary tree without interference from intestinal gas or abdominal fat. EUS is particularly important in correctly identifying
patients with acute biliary pancreatitis from other causes of
pancreatitis.
Choledocholithiasis may be mobile, multiple, and of variable size (Fig. 39.4). Occasionally, stones do not demonstrate
acoustic shadowing and may be associated with a thickened bile
duct wall. Bile duct sludge is seen as variably shaped and easily
distorted echo-rich structures without acoustic shadowing.
In the setting of suspected choledocholithiasis, EUS has a
sensitivity of more than 90% for the detection of common bile
duct stones. The ﬁndings compare favorably with those of
ERCP and are superior to those obtained with transabdominal
ultrasonography, without the associated postprocedural ERCP
risk of pancreatitis. For patients with a low or intermediate
risk of bile duct stones, EUS is a cost-effective initial screening

seen as echo-rich areas with typical post-acoustic shadowing within
the common bile duct.

study. Comparative controlled trials of EUS and magnetic
resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) have demonstrated that the accuracy of EUS is comparable to or higher
than that of MRCP for the detection of common bile duct
stones.
A recent systematic review has suggested that EUS should
be reserved for the evaluation of patients with an intermediate
suspicion of common duct stones. Although EUS does not
have the therapeutic capacity of ERCP for stone removal,
algorithms have been developed that incorporate its use into
clinical practice. Ultimately, the choice of modality should be
based on clinical suspicion, availability of resources, experience, and cost.
Cholelithiasis

EUS can reliably identify cholelithiasis, particularly in the setting of small stones and obese patients. The appearance is that
of a hyperechoic structure within the gallbladder sometimes
associated with an acoustic shadow. In patients with suspected
gallbladder stone disease but with negative ﬁndings on conventional transabdominal ultrasonographic examinations, the
sensitivity and speciﬁcity of EUS are 96% and 86%, respectively, when compared with the corresponding cholecystectomy specimens or long-term clinical follow-up.
Microlithiasis

EUS has been shown to be as accurate as crystal analysis for the
detection of microlithiasis (Fig. 39.5). In approximately 20%
of patients with acute pancreatitis, the cause is not established

434

Section VII Pancreas and Biliary Tree

A

Polyps

With EUS, the normal gallbladder wall is seen as a two- or
three-layer structure: the inner hypoechoic layer corresponds
to the muscularis propria layer and the outer hyperechoic
layer corresponds to an adipose layer. Cholesterol polyps are
usually smaller than 10 mm in diameter and appear on ultrasonography as tiny echogenic spots or echogenic pedunculated masses without acoustic shadowing (Fig. 39.6).
Cholangiography

Cholangiography can be performed either invasively or noninvasively. The selection of MRCP, percutaneous transhepatic
cholangiography, ERCP, or EUS-guided biliary access is based
largely on the clinical setting and institutional expertise.
Magnetic Resonance Cholangiopancreatography

B

MRCP or CT should be the ﬁrst examination of choice because
they are less invasive than EUS. They have a similar ability for
detecting stones, but MRCP may be preferable because of the
possibility of a CT-associated allergic reaction. MRCP also is
favored for frail patients who are not candidates for conscious
sedation and for patients with coagulopathy or who need concurrent staging or evaluation of the liver parenchyma or other
organs, especially when there is little likelihood for therapeutic
intervention. MRCP appears to be a valuable and safe technique for the evaluation of pregnant patients with acute
pancreaticobiliary disease. Especially when ultrasonography
shows biliary dilatation, MRCP can determine the cause and
prevent unnecessary ERCP by excluding biliary abnormality.

by history, physical examination, routine laboratory testing,
or abdominal imaging. Recent studies suggest that microlithiasis may account for an unexplained attack of acute pancreatitis in as many as 75% of patients with a gallbladder in
situ. Sphincter of Oddi dysfunction is most prevalent in
patients with recurrent attacks who have previously undergone cholecystectomy. Therefore, EUS is an important diagnostic tool in evaluating patients who have unexplained
biliary colic.

Figure 39.6 Echogenic region without acoustic shadowing.

39 Gallstones

When MRCP results are negative, EUS is recommended to
check for small common bile duct stones.
Hemorrhagic cholecystitis is a form of acute cholecystitis
often seen in the absence of gallstones. Hemorrhage is identiﬁed by the characteristic appearance of hemoglobin breakdown products within the wall or lumen of the gallbladder.
A combination of MRCP and CT is useful for preoperative
diagnosis of Mirizzi’s syndrome.
Percutaneous Transhepatic Cholangiography

Percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography may be favored
for patients with more proximal obstruction (hilar or above)
or surgically distorted gastroduodenal anatomy (especially
Roux limbs but also Whipple or Billroth II anatomy) and after
failure of previous ERCP. It is almost uniformly successful in
patients with dilated ducts and in 75% to 95% of those with
nondilated ducts. The overall risk, including death, sepsis, bile
leaks, and intraperitoneal bleeding, is 3% to 8%.
Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography

ERCP is favored for patients with ascites or coagulation defects,
suspected periampullary or pancreatic neoplasia, nondilated
ducts, anticipated need for therapeutic maneuvers (stone removal
and stenting), or hypersensitivity to contrast agents and if percutaneous routes failed. Purely diagnostic use is diminishing rapidly because, for most patients, EUS and MRCP serve this purpose
more safely. ERCP is successful in more than 95% of diagnostic
applications, in 90% to 95% of sphincterotomies and complete
stone extraction, and in 90% of procedures for stenting of
malignant obstruction (Fig. 39.7). Intraductal shock wave

lithotripsy offers a therapeutic option that may be effective despite
the difﬁculties of a large, impacted stone that cannot be captured
by a basket or a stricture that prohibits delivery of a stone beyond
it. The overall risk of the procedure in patients with suspected
gallstones is 2% to 7% for diagnostic procedures and 7% to
10% for therapy. Risks include death, pancreatitis, infection,
sedation or cardiovascular events, hemorrhage, and perforation.
Patients with gallstone pancreatitis who have concomitant
cholangitis should have ERCP within 24 hours. Patients with a
high suspicion of a persistent common duct stone (visible
common bile duct stone on noninvasive imaging, persistently
dilated common bile duct, and jaundice) should have ERCP
within 72 hours. Although data supporting the practice of
endoscopic sphincterotomy in the absence of choledocholithiasis at the time of the procedure are lacking, it is a reasonable therapeutic option. ERCP and sphincterotomy alone
may provide adequate long-term therapy for patients who are
not candidates for surgery. Cholecystectomy should be performed during the same hospital admission if possible and no
later than 2 to 4 weeks after discharge for patients with a gallbladder in situ.
Treatments for gallstones are listed in Table 39.4, and
mimics of biliary colic are listed in Table 39.5.

Answers

VII. 1. Answer c.
The diagnosis of pancreatitis is established by the more
than threefold increase in lipase and characteristic
abdominal pain; abdominal CT is not necessary. There
are several markers of severity, including organ failure
(increased creatinine level) and hemoconcentration.
However, pancreatic necrosis is diagnosed with CT;
other severity markers do not accurately predict pancreatic necrosis. In recent randomized clinical trials,
treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics has not
been shown to improve outcome. Because of the predictors of severity present in this case, managing it as a
case of mild pancreatitis and possibly dismissing the
patient early could worsen the outcome. Aggressive
ﬂuid resuscitation (in an intensive care unit if necessary) is recommended to improve intravascular
volume depletion; it has been suggested to decrease
the risk of pancreatic necrosis.
VII. 2. Answer b.
If performed early (within 48–72 hours), contrastenhanced CT often fails to show pancreatic necrosis.
At this point, the prognosis is dictated by the presence
or absence of pancreatic necrosis that could be established by repeat cross-sectional imaging with contrast.
Enteral nutrition has been shown to be superior to
parenteral nutrition, and if the imaging studies conﬁrm pancreatic necrosis, enteral nutrition should be
started with placement of a jejunal feeding tube. Pancreatic biochemistry values do not predict severity,
and serial determinations have clinical use after the
diagnosis of acute pancreatitis has been established.
VII. 3. Answer c.
This patient has mild pancreatitis, and rapid recovery
is predicted by the absence of severity markers (no
organ failure and a normal hematocrit) and physical
examination ﬁndings. Prolonged fasting does not

improve outcome, and the decision to refeed is made
on the basis of clinical ﬁndings rather than on the levels
of lipase or amylase. It is important to identify the cause
of a ﬁrst episode of acute pancreatitis. In this patient,
the increase in the levels of transaminases is highly predictive of a biliary cause. The pattern does not suggest
alcoholic pancreatitis. The presence of gallstones should
be established with ultrasonography.
VII. 4. Answer a.
In this clinical setting, the ﬁnding of microlithiasis
(“sludge”) in combination with the increased levels of
transaminases, with rapid normalization, is highly
predictive of biliary pancreatitis. To prevent recurrent
pancreatitis, cholecystectomy should be performed
before dismissal. The rapid normalization of liver
biochemistry values predicts passage of the offending
lithiasis, and no preoperative assessment for choledocholithiasis is needed. Biliary sphincterotomy is indicated for patients with comorbid conditions that
preclude cholecystectomy.
VII. 5. Answer c.
This clinical presentation is characteristic of macroamylasemia, a relatively common cause (3%–5%) of
spurious increase in the serum level of amylase. Amylase associates with macromolecules, reducing urinary
clearance and leading to increased levels in the serum.
It has no association with disease, pancreatic or otherwise. In patients with this artifact, lipase levels should
be used to diagnose acute pancreatitis. Amylase or
lipase levels are not of value in establishing a diagnosis
of chronic pancreatitis.
VII. 6. Answer d.
Autoimmune pancreatitis has a unique histologic pattern that distinguishes it from other forms of chronic
pancreatitis. The characteristic features include all the
441

442

Section VII Pancreas and Biliary Tree

features noted above except “d” (obliterative arteritis). Autoimmune pancreatitis is characterized by
dense lymphoplasmacytic inﬁltration that surrounds
veins and spares adjacent arteries.
VII. 7. Answer b.
Most cases of sporadic chronic pancreatitis are
believed to be due to a combination of inherited susceptibility genes and environmental risk factors (eg,
alcohol and smoking). The genetic factors include
mutations in one or more of six genes associated
with pancreatitis: cationic trypsinogen gene (PRSS1),
anionic trypsinogen gene (PRSS2), serine protease
inhibitor Kazal 1 gene (SPINK1), cystic ﬁbrosis
transmembrane conductance regulator gene (CFTR),
chymotrypsinogen C gene (CTRC), and calciumsensing receptor gene (CASR). Of these, only mutations in the cationic trypsinogen gene (R117H and
N21I) are commonly associated with an autosomal
dominant pattern of inheritance of pancreatitis. For
this patient, the history of early onset of pancreatitis
and the strong family history of pancreatitis are
highly suggestive of hereditary chronic pancreatitis.
Mutations in SPINK1 and CFTR genes are associated
with idiopathic pancreatitis. Although heavy smoking and alcohol use, alone or in combination, can
predispose to chronic pancreatitis, they would not
explain the striking family history of pancreatitis of
this patient.
VII.8. Answer c.
Without a deﬁnitive histologic study, the diagnosis
of chronic pancreatitis is made by considering the
results of clinical, imaging, biochemical, and pancreatic function studies. Chronic abdominal pain following an episode of acute pancreatitis may be due
to a complication of pancreatitis but is rarely due to
chronic pancreatitis. EUS ﬁndings can be abnormal
in alcoholics without pancreatitis. Persistent mild
increases in serum amylase levels indicate the possibility of macroamylasemia, a benign asymptomatic
condition. An EUS study showing intraductal stones
is highly suggestive of chronic pancreatitis, whereas
normal EUS ﬁndings virtually exclude chronic pancreatitis.
VII.9. Answer e.
More than 90% of pancreatic function has to be lost
to cause steatorrhea. Ideally, oral pancreatic enzyme
supplements should be taken throughout the meal.
Enzymes taken before or after a meal are not as effective as enzymes taken during the meal. Steatorrhea is
associated with a fat-soluble vitamin deﬁciency
rather than vitamin B12 and folic acid deﬁciencies.
Approximately 30,000 to 45,000 units of lipase
should be given with every meal. Correction of steatorrhea with oral enzyme supplements is associated

with correction of carbohydrate and protein malabsorption.
VII.10. Answer c.
Randomized controlled trials suggest that for patients
who have chronic calciﬁc pancreatitis with a dilated
duct, the preferred intervention is a drainage procedure such as lateral pancreaticojejunostomy. However, none of the interventions will improve
pancreatic exocrine or endocrine function. It is
debated whether chronic pancreatitis eventually
“burns out” to become painless. However, for this
patient, waiting without intervention is not an
option because his disease is symptomatic.
VII. 11. Answer d.
The symptoms and presentation of the patient are
characteristic of painless obstructive jaundice from a
periampullary malignancy. Cancer of the pancreatic
head is the most common (ductal adenocarcinoma).
This presentation would be atypical for acute liver
injury, viral or otherwise. Patients who present with
malignant biliary obstruction are rarely infected
unless they have had ERCP or a stent has been placed.
Antibiotics are not warranted, and the evaluation
usually can be performed on an outpatient basis.
ERCP is valuable as a therapeutic intervention for
biliary obstruction if surgery is not feasible (ie, tumor
is unresectable) or delayed. Contrast-enhanced CT
is the most accurate ﬁrst test for diagnosis, for staging pancreatic cancer, and for directing appropriate
consultations and further diagnostic or therapeutic
studies.
VII.12. Answer c.
A high-quality CT scan that shows a resectable (stage
II) mass with features typical of obstruction (double
duct sign) is sufﬁcient evidence to proceed to surgery. “Proving” the diagnosis with ﬁne-needle aspiration is unlikely to change the decision to operate
(false-negative results are not rare with cytologic
examination in pancreatic cancer) and can cause
complications, such as bleeding or pancreatitis. Biliary decompression before surgical resection has
been shown recently in a randomized prospective
study to have no effect on outcome or surgical complications. CA19-9 levels are not useful for staging
and cannot be used alone to make the diagnosis,
especially in the presence of obstructive jaundice.
VII.13. Answer c.
The long-term survival rate approximates 20% after
resection in “favorable” pancreatic cancer (ie, small
size, absence of lymph node metastasis, differentiation, and clear resection margin), but the operative
mortality rate for a Whipple resection is about 3%
even in high-volume surgical centers. Median survival after resection is 20 to 22 months. Although the

Questions and Answers

beneﬁts of radiation after surgical resection are
uncertain, administration of either 5-ﬂuorouracil/
lamivudine or gemcitabine has been shown to
improve overall and disease-free survival.
VII.14. Answer d.
Incidental cysts are increasingly a clinical dilemma
because of the frequency of cross-sectional imaging.
Most incidental cysts represent branch duct intraductal papillary mucinous tumor; mucinous cystadenomas occur almost exclusively in women. ERCP
is rarely needed for diagnostic purposes. If further
diagnostic work-up is required because of the size of
the cyst, then EUS with the possibility of cyst puncture and analysis can increase diagnostic conﬁdence.
Cysts smaller than 2 cm can be followed as long as
they are asymptomatic and the main pancreatic duct
is not involved. Surgical resection would involve a
Whipple resection, and its risks would outweigh the
immediate low risk that this cyst would progress to
frank malignancy.
VII.15. Answer e.
This likely represents a neoplastic cyst; a mucinous
cystadenoma is most often seen in middle-aged
women. Importantly, the cyst is almost certainly
symptomatic; additional diagnostic studies are
not needed, and the patient can be referred for
resection.
VII.16. Answer c.
The frequency of gallstones during 1 year of treatment with the somatostatin analogue octreotide
varies from 0% to 50%. In animal studies, gallbladder stasis and gallbladder bile concentrations of
calcium, monoglucuronide, total bilirubin, protein,
and lipids increased in the octreotide group and
led to greater concentrations of bile in the gallbladder. It was concluded that these changes in
composition increase the potential for cholesterol
and calcium bilirubinate precipitation (gallstone
formation).
VII.17. Answer d.
Biliary microlithiasis is considered an important
cause of idiopathic acute pancreatitis and is thought
to be the etiologic factor in up to 75% of patients

443

with an unexplained episode of acute pancreatitis
with the gallbladder in situ. EUS is a reliable procedure to use to diagnose gallbladder microlithiasis. A
cost minimization study identiﬁed EUS as the least
costly initial test for the diagnostic evaluation of
patients with idiopathic pancreatitis with the gallbladder in situ.
VII. 18. Answer b.
Symptomatic gallstone disease is the second most
common abdominal emergency in pregnant women.
Diabetes puts her at increased risk for emphysematous cholecystitis. Surgical management of symptomatic cholelithiasis in pregnancy is safe, shortens
hospitalization, and decreases the rate of labor induction and preterm deliveries. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is a safe procedure in all trimesters.
VII. 19. Answer d.
Early treatment with ursodeoxycholic acid may be
beneﬁcial for patients at risk for developing cystic
ﬁbrosis chronic liver disease, and it improves clinical
and biochemical variables in such patients with liver
disease. Patients who have cystic ﬁbrosis have an
increased prevalence of gallstones compared with
healthy age-matched controls (30% vs 5%, respectively). The major component of gallstones in cystic
ﬁbrosis is calcium bilirubinate, which forms black
pigment gallstones. Thus, the best management in
this case is with ursodeoxycholic acid.
VII. 20. Answer b.
Brown pigment gallstones are composed of calcium
salts of unconjugated bilirubin with varying amounts
of cholesterol and protein. They are formed as a
result of chronic bacterial infection of the bile and
are almost always associated with colonization of
bile by enteric organisms. Liver ﬂukes (Opisthorchis
viverrini and Clonorchis sinensis), prevalent in Thailand and China, are associated with biliary stone formation. The etiologic process leading to stone
formation is not clearly understood. It has been proposed that stone formation is stimulated directly by
the parasitic worm or the calciﬁed overcoat of the
egg, which may act as a nidus and stimulate the precipitation of calcium bilirubinate.

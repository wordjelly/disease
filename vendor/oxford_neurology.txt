CHAPTER 1

Neurological history and examination

Principles of neurological history taking
The primary role of the examination becomes the testing of the
hypotheses derived from the history.
—William Landau
The usual approach to a clinical problem is to ask the following:
• Where is the lesion, e.g., brain, spinal cord, anterior horn cell,
peripheral nerve, neuromuscular junction, muscle?
• What is the etiology, e.g., vascular, degenerative, toxic, infectious
genetic, inflammatory, neoplastic, functional?
• What is the differential diagnosis?
• Is treatment possible?
• What is the prognosis?
A detailed history usually will yield more information than the neurological
examination and ancillary tests.
• Family members and eyewitness accounts are essential, e.g., in patients
with dementia or episodic loss of consciousness. Obtain a history by
telephone if necessary.
• A review of outside records may be very useful.
• Analysis of symptoms will follow a similar plan:
• Date/week/month/year of onset
• Character and severity
• Location and radiation
• Time course
• Associated symptoms
• Aggravating and alleviating factors
• Previous treatments
• Remissions and relapses

Past medical history
Do not accept the patient’s diagnostic terms, e.g., “migraine,” “seizure,”
“stroke.” Ask about specific symptoms.

Family history
Draw a family tree. Document specific illnesses and cause of death, if
known. In particular, ask about the age and cause of death of the patient’s
parents. In certain communities, ask about consanguinity. If you are suspicious of an undiagnosed disease in a family member, ask about symptoms.
For example, a family member with weakness and gait disturbance may
have never been diagnosed with myopathy.

Social history
This should include inquiries regarding the following:
• Alcohol
• Smoking
• Occupation
• Recreational drug use
• Sexual history
• Detailed travel history
• Dietary habits

CRANIAL NERVE I (OLFACTORY NERVE)

The general examination
• This starts on first meeting the patient; it is useful practice to bring
patients back from the waiting room yourself. Gait disturbance, tremor,
loss of facial expression, and dysarthria can often be identified while
leading the patient from the waiting room to the examination room.
General examination can provide valuable clues. Ideally all patients
should be stripped to their underclothes.
• Cardiovascular system. Pulse, heart sounds, auscultation of the carotid
arteries, blood pressure (lying down and standing after 3 minutes if any
suggestion of autonomic involvement).
• Respiratory system. Diaphragmatic movement. May need to measure
forced vital capacity (FVC) and negative inspiratory force (NIF) in
patients with neuromuscular weakness.
• Gastrointestinal system. Palpate for hepatosplenomegaly or abdominal
masses.
• Genitalia. In men, testicular examination should be considered. Rectal
examination if malignancy is suspected or assessment of anal tone and
sensation if cord or cauda equina compression in differential diagnosis.
• Breasts. Essential if neoplastic or paraneoplastic conditions are considered.
• Examine the spine. A hairy patch may indicate underlying spinal
disorder or a dermal sinus. Auscultation over spine may reveal the bruit
of a dural arteriovenous malformation (AVM).
• Skin. Melanoma, vasculitic rash, livedo reticularis, or vitiligo may suggest the
presence of a systemic disease that may have neurologic manifestations.
• Head. Palpate the temporal arteries in elderly headache patients;
auscultation may reveal a bruit. Palpate the trapezii for evidence of
tenderness in muscle tension and cervicogenic headache.

Cranial nerve I (olfactory nerve)
• Patients may not recognize a problem unless it is essential for work
or hobbies, e.g., chef. Furthermore, it may be difficult to tell whether
patients have trouble with a specific smell because they have anosmia
or because they are just not familiar with it.
• The nose is supplied by the olfactory and trigeminal nerves. Irritants
like NH3 stimulate the trigeminal nerve and may be misleading.
• Use the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT)
if available. Otherwise use bedside products, e.g., orange peel, coffee,
chocolate, peppermint, or cinnamon. Ask if there is a smell (perception,
peripheral process) and then identify it (cognitive, central process).
• Differential diagnosis for anosmia:
• Viral infection
• Head injury
• Parkinson disease (PD)
• Alzheimer disease (AD)
• Refsum disease
• Olfactory groove meningioma
• Sjogren syndrome
• Toxic (intranasal zinc, some antihypertensives, thyroid supplements)
• Kallman syndrome (anosmia + hypogonadism, X-linked recessive)

Neurological history and examination

Cranial nerve II (optic nerve and
visual pathway)
Visual acuity
• Test distance acuity of each eye with an eye chart (see Fig. 1.1).
• Correction for refractive errors with glasses or using a pinhole.
• In papilledema, visual acuity is preserved unless chronic. In optic
neuritis or infiltration, visual acuity is impaired.
• Color vision tested with Ishihara color plates.

Visual fields
• Assess visual fields by confrontation with each eye in turn using a red
pin (5 mm red target), finger waving, or finger counting.

CRANIAL NERVE II (OPTIC NERVE AND VISUAL PATHWAY)

• Goldmann perimeter is a bowl-shaped device and uses small light
targets (kinetic).
• Humphrey is an automated technique (static).
• Visual inattention may indicate parietal lobe dysfunction.
• Uncooperative or aphasic patients—observe reaction to threat.

Visual field defects
•
•
•
•
•

Monocular field defect: ocular, retinal, or optic nerve disorders.
Constricted fields—glaucoma, chronic papilledema.
Tunnel vision—retinitis pigmentosa or nonorganic.
Central scotoma—optic nerve or macular disease.
Altitudinal defects are due to retinal vascular lesions. Vessels do not
cross the horizontal raphe.
Defects affecting both eyes may indicate a lesion of or behind the optic
chiasm (vertical meridian). The common patterns of field loss are shown in
Table 1.1. Figure 1.2 shows a diagram of visual field defects.
Clinical points
• Complete homonymous hemianopia indicates only that the lesion
is behind the optic chiasm. The more posterior the lesion, the more
congruous the defect.
• Macular sparing may occur in a posterior cerebral artery (PCA)
stroke. The PCA supplies most of the visual cortex, but the
occipital pole may be supplied by a branch of the middle cerebral
artery (MCA).
• Junctional lesions between the optic nerve and chiasm affect ipsilateral
optic nerve fibers and fibers from the inferior nasal retina of the
opposite optic nerve as they loop after decussation.

Pupillary reactions (cranial nerves II and III)
• Test reaction to light: direct and consensual with a bright pen light;
ophthalmoscope light not strong enough (see Table 1.2).
• Accommodation reflex is observed by watching the pupil as gaze is
shifted from a distant object to a near object.
• Relative afferent pupillary defect (Marcus–Gunn pupil) results from optic
nerve dysfunction or, if extensive, retinal disease. Detected by the “swinging
flashlight test”—a bright light is quickly moved back and forth between the
eyes. The affected eye dilates rather than constricts when the light is swung
to it because less light is perceived by the damaged pathway.

Funduscopy with the direct ophthalmoscope
• Reduce the ambient light in the room as much as possible.
• Turn on the ophthalmoscope and adjust the size of the light to
approximate the size of the pupil.
• Look for the red reflex and move in to focus on the optic disc.
• Assess disc color for pallor.
Funduscopic findings
• Pigmented temporal crescent seen in myopes.
• Eighty percent of normal discs will have venous pulsation. May be
elicited by gentle eyeball pressure.
• Disc edema (called “papilledema” if secondary to increased intracranial
pressure)

CHAPTER 1

Neurological history and examination

Cranial nerves III (oculomotor),
IV (trochlear), and VI (abducens)
See Figure 1.3. Figure 1.4 shows the muscles innervated by cranial nerves
III, IV, and VI.

Diplopia (see Table 1.3)
• Monocular diplopia may be functional, or due to refractive error, cataract,
media opacity, macular disease, or a visual cortex disorder (bilateral).
• Horizontal diplopia is due to weakness of medial or lateral rectus.
• Oblique separation with one image slightly tilted is due to superior or
inferior oblique weakness.
• Images are maximally separated when direction of gaze is toward the
site of maximal action of the paretic muscle.
• The outer image comes from the paretic eye.
• If head tilt is present, it is in the direction of action of the affected
muscle (e.g., a right IV palsy would be associated with the head down
and the top of the head rotated to the left).

Eye movements: pursuits and saccades
• Fixation—observe the fixed eye for 30 seconds: horizontal square
wave jerks are seen in cerebellar disease, progressive supranuclear
palsy (PSP), and multiple system atrophy (MSA).
• Saccades (rapid conjugate eye movements) tested by asking the patient
to fixate between two targets. Observe for speed of initiation (latency).
• Undershoot = hypometria found in cerebellar disorders, PD, and
Huntington disease (HD).
• Overshoot = hypermetria caused by cerebellar dysfunction.
• May help detect a subtle internuclear ophthalmoplegia (INO). In a
partial lesion, there will be slowing of adduction ipsilateral to the
lesion and nystagmus in contralateral abducting eye. In complete lesion,
adduction is absent. INO is caused by a lesion of the medial longitudinal fasciculus, usually from demyelination or stroke (see Fig. 1.5).

Figure 1.3 Paresis of the oculmotor nerve. Ptosis due to paresis of the levator
palpebrae muscle. The right eye is abducted and infraducted due to the unopposed
actions of the lateral rectus and superior oblique muscles.

• Smooth pursuit. Test horizontal and vertical movements by tracking
a target keeping the head still. Broken pursuit nonspecific sign due to
cerebellar disease, drugs, e.g., anticonvulsants and sedatives. If only
in one direction indicates posterior cortical lesion ipsilateral to the
direction of broken pursuit.

Nystagmus
• Involuntary oscillation is initiated by a slow drift of the eye. If followed
by a corrective fast phase = jerk nystagmus; if both phases have equal
velocity = pendular nystagmus. Direction of nystagmus described by
fast phase.

• Jerk nystagmus caused by vestibular system imbalance, either peripheral
vestibular structures (labyrinth, vestibular nerve) or central vestibular
structures (brainstem, cerebellum). See Table 1.4.
Peripheral vestibular patterns
• Acute vestibular lesion
• Spontaneous unidirectional horizontal > torsional nystagmus
• Increased velocity of nystagmus with gaze in the direction of the
fast phase
• Suppressed with fixation
• Does not change direction
• Rarely mimicked by lesion in central vestibular structures
Positionally triggered nystagmus
• Posterior canal benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV)
• Burst of upbeat torsional nystagmus with Dix-Hallpike test
• Duration of nystagmus <30 seconds

• Direction of nystagmus can be toward or away from the direction
of head turn.
Central vestibular patterns
• Downbeat nystagmus
• Can be present in the primary position, with gaze or triggered by
positionally testing
• Due to disturbance of vestibulocerebellum caused by Arnold–Chiari
malformation, cerebellar degeneration, drug toxicity, e.g., lithium
• Upbeat nystagmus
• Generally present in primary position but can be brought out by
gaze or positional testing
• Less localizing than downbeat nystagmus—can occur with lesions of
the paramedian medulla but also pontine or midbrain lesion
• Causes: multiple sclerosis (MS), vascular, cerebellar degeneration
• Pure torsional nystagmus
• Can be in primary gaze or triggered by positional testing
• Generally localizes to the medulla
• Common causes: syringobulbia, stroke, tumor
• Gaze-evoked nystagmus (GEN)
• Only present on eccentric gaze not primary position
• May be horizontal, upbeating on upgaze and/or down beating on
downgaze
• Bilateral horizontal GEN due to cerebellar and brainstem disorders,
drugs, alcohol, diffuse metabolic disorders

CHAPTER 1

Neurological history and examination

Cranial nerves V and VII–XII
Cranial nerve V (trigeminal)
Sensory via three divisions (ophthalmic V1, maxillary V2, mandibular V3)
(see Fig. 1.6)
• Sensation but not taste to anterior two-thirds of the tongue also
supplied by trigeminal nerve.
• Motor fibers to muscles of mastication (temporalis, masseter, and
pterygoids via mandibular division)
• Jaw deviates to side of weak pterygoid muscle.
• Corneal reflex has a consensual component. Useful in the presence of
an ipsilateral facial palsy.
• Jaw jerk—if brisk indicates pathology above midbrain level.

Cranial nerve VII (facial)
• Supplies the muscles of facial expression and taste to anterior twothirds of the tongue (via corda tympani branch).
• Lower motor neuron facial palsies result in complete ipsilateral facial
weakness.
• The upper face is bilaterally innervated—frontalis and to a lesser
extent orbicularis oculi are spared in upper motor neuron palsies.

Cranial nerve VIII (vestibulocochlear nerve)
• Two divisions:
• Cochlear (hearing)
• Vestibular (balance)
• Hearing is crudely tested by whispering numbers in one ear while
blocking the other.
• Rinne test—Hold 256 Hz tuning fork base on mastoid. Wait until sound
disappears, and then hold tines in the air next to the ear.
• Normal or sensorineural deafness—air conduction is louder than
bone conduction.
• Conductive deafness—bone conduction is louder than air
conduction.
• Weber test—tuning fork placed in middle of forehead.
• Unilateral conductive deafness—louder to the ipsilateral side
• Sensorineural deafness—louder to contralateral side

Cranial nerve IX (glossopharnygeal nerve)
• Taste fibers from posterior third of the tongue
• General sensation tympanic membrane, mucous membranes from
posterior pharynx, tonsils, and soft palate
• Afferent part of the gag reflex

Cranial nerve X (vagus nerve)
• Motor fibers innervate the striated muscles of palate, pharynx, and
larynx.
• Soft palate observed as patient says “aahh.” The uvula deviates away
from side of lesion.

• Lesions of recurrent laryngeal branch cause ipsilateral vocal cord
paralysis with dysphonia and a weak cough.
• Parasympathetic autonomic fibers travel in the vagus nerve to the
respiratory, gastrointestinal (GI), and cardiovascular systems.

Cranial nerve XI (spinal accessory nerve)
• Innervation to sternocleidomastoid (SCM) and trapezius.
• SCM (supplied by ipsilateral hemisphere) assessed by asking patient to
twist the head against resistance and palpate contralateral SCM.
• Trapezius assessed by shoulder shrug and palpating muscle.

Cranial XII (hypoglossal nerve)
• Observe for fasciculations. Observe with tongue inside the mouth.
• Tongue strength assessed by asking patient to push inside the mouth
against cheek.
• Tongue movement dexterity assessed by asking patient to move tongue
side to side. Slowness without wasting suggests spasticity.
• In hypoglossal lesions, tongue deviated to the side of the lesion.

CHAPTER 1

Neurological history and examination

Motor examination
Ideally, patient should be stripped to underclothes.

General points
• Document hand dominance.
• Look for wasting—first dorsal interosseus muscle easiest (ulnar).
• Examine scapular muscles (winging of the scapula due to lesions of long
thoracic nerve).
• Palpate extensor digitorum brevis (EDB) on the foot. This muscle is
often atrophic in neurogenic conditions.
• Observe for fasciculations—may need to spend a few minutes in good
light.
• Have patient hold arms outstretched with palms up and eyes closed.
• Pronator drift indicates mild pyramidal weakness.
• Pseudoathetosis (involuntary movements of fingers) indicates loss
of position sense.
• Postural tremor may be caused by essential tremor, demyelinating
neuropathy, or drugs (sodium valproate, steroids).
• Have the patient rotate arms around each other with elbows flexed. If one
arm orbits around the other, the arm that is moving less may be weaker.

Tone
Spastic (pyramidal) assessed by the following:
• Upper limbs:
• Rapid flexion/extension movement at the elbow (clasp knife)
• Supinator catch (rapid supination movement at wrist)
• Hoffman sign (rapid flexion at DIP joint of middle finger results in
brisk flexion movements at other fingers)—positive in upper motor
lesions
• Lower limbs:
• Brisk flexion of the knee when legs extended results in a catch if
tone increased.
• Test for clonus at ankles.
• Have the patient lie on back and lift thigh from bed. In normal or
low tone, the heel will drag on the bed. If tone is increased, the heel
will elevate.
Extrapyramidal increase in tone assessed by the following:
• By slow flexion/extension movements at the wrist
• May be enhanced by synkinesia (ask patient to move contralateral limb)

Muscle strength
All that is required is maximal strength for one second—useful in patients
with “giveway weakness.” Table 1.5 gives the muscles to be tested, and
Table 1.6 gives a grading system to evaluate the results.

Coordination
• Finger tapping—have the patient tap the crease of the thumb with the
tip of the index finger and observe for speed, regularity of rhythm, and
accuracy.

• Rapid alternating hand movements—have the patient pronate and
supinate the hand on a stable surface. Observe speed, accuracy, and
rhythm. Dysdiadokinesia is the inability to perform this action normally.
• Finger-to-nose testing—have the patient move his or her finger back
and forth between his or her nose and your finger. Hold your finger far
enough away so the patient has to extend the arm fully. Observe for
accuracy, kinetic tremor (tremor throughout movement), and intention
tremor (tremor that increases in amplitude as the target is approached).
• Heel-to-shin testing—have the patient move his or her heel up and
down his or her shin. Best done with the patient supine. Observe for
accuracy and tremor.

Sensory testing
• Test the integrity of the afferent pathways. Map out abnormality to
determine if it is in the distribution of a single nerve or dermatome, a
length-dependent pattern, a spinal level, or if there is hemianesthesia
suggesting a brain or brainstem localization.
• Primary sensory modalities
• Light touch—this is best done with a cotton wisp.
• Pain—use a safety pin and ask the patient to tell you if you are
applying pressure with the sharp end or the dull end.
• Temperature—a cold tuning fork should be felt equally in all four
extremities.
• Vibration—hold a 128-Hz tuning fork firmly on the patient’s distal
phalanx and let the vibration fade until the patient can no longer
detect it.
• Proprioception (joint position sense)—hold the medial and lateral
aspects of the distal phalanx and ask the patient to tell you if you
are moving the digit up or down. Most patients can identify changes
of just a few degrees. (Note: The Romberg test is also a means of
measuring position sense.)
• Discriminative sensory functions—all tested with the patient’s eyes closed.
• Extinction—ask the patient to tell you whether you are touching
the extremities on the left, the right, or both.

• Graphesthesia—ask a blindfolded patient to identify a number
drawn on his or her index finger with a ballpoint pen.
• Stereognosis—ask the patient to identify a small object (e.g., coin,
key, paperclip, guitar pick) placed in his or her hand.

Deep and superficial tendon reflexes (see Table 1.7)
Deep tendon reflexes
• The deep tendon reflexes are graded from 0 (absent), trace (present
with reinforcement), 1+ (depressed), 2+ (normal), 3+ (increased), or
4+ (sustained clonus).
• Reinforcement can be obtained by jaw clenching or Jendrassik
maneuver (patient links hands and pulls).
• Deep tendon reflexes may also be inverted—the tested reflex is
absent, but there is spread to a lower level. This indicates a lower
motor neuron lesion at the level of the reflex but an upper motor
neuron lesion below (most common at C5/C6).
Main superficial reflexes
• Abdominal (upperT8/9; lowerT10/11)—absent in some upper motor
neuron lesions
• Cremasteric (L1/2)—elicited by stroking inner thigh with reflex
ipsilateral testicular elevation
• Anal (S4/5)—scratch anal margin with reflex contraction visible

Gait examination
• Casual gait—observe how far apart the feet are while walking.
• Heel walk (tibialis anterior) and toe walk (gastrocnemius) are good for
assessing subtle weakness in these muscles.
• Tandem gait—have the patient walk heel to toe, as if on a tightrope.
This is a more sensitive way to assess for balance difficulties.
• Romberg sign. The patient stands with eyes closed and feet together.
Falling without catching oneself suggests disturbance of proprioception.
Useful in nonorganic disorders.
The various gait disturbances encountered in clinical practice are shown
in Table 1.8.

MS, multiple sclerosis; MSA, multiple system atrophy; PSP, progressive supranuclear palsy; UMN,
upper motor neuron syndrome.

Bedside cognitive testing, including
language
There is no point in attempting a cognitive assessment in a patient who is
drowsy or uncooperative.

1 Alertness Record the level of wakefulness and reactivity.
2 Orientation
• Time (time of day; day of the week, month, and year). Disorientation
in time common in delirium, moderate dementia, and amnestic
syndromes.
• Place (building, town, county, country).
• Person (name, age, date of birth). Dysphasic patients may appear
confused due to an inability to understand or express themselves.

3 Attention and concentration
• Count backwards from 20.
• List the months of the year backward.

BEDSIDE COGNITIVE TESTING, INCLUDING LANGUAGE

• Digit span. Ask patient to repeat string of increasing digits—two trials
at each level. Record highest level at which either trial is correct, e.g.,
3
4
8

7
9

Normal 6 ± 1

4 Memory
Anterograde memory
• Name and address, e.g., John Green, 157, Church Lane, Ann Arbor, MI
• Assess immediate recall and after 5 minutes
Retrograde memory
• Recent world events—sports, celebrity news or scandals, president
and vice president
• Autobiographical memory—parents, childhood events

5 Frontal executive function (frontal lobe)
Initiation—verbal fluency test
• Ask patient to generate as many words as possible in 1 minute
beginning with the letter F, A, or S, excluding names of people or
places. Normal: 15 depending on age and intellect.
• Name as many animals or fruits in 1 minute. >20, normal; <10 abnormal.
Abstract thought
Interpretation of proverbs (frontal lobe disorders result in concrete interpretations), e.g., “a stitch in time saves nine”; “too many cooks spoil the broth.”
Cognitive estimates
Frontal patients give bizarre and illogical answers to questions like the
following:
• What is the height of an average American woman?
• What is the population of Milwaukee?
• How many bison are there in Michigan?
Alternating hand movements
• With arms out, fingers of one hand extended; the other with fist
clenched. Reverse positions rhythmically (see Fig. 1.7).
• Luria three-step test (see Fig. 1.8). Difficulties with complex motor
movements associated with left frontal lesions.

6 Dominant (usually left) hemisphere function
Language
Aphasia (Table 1.9) and dysphasia are impairments of language function.
Dysarthria is the abnormal motor production of speech.
• Spontaneous speech assessed during conversation and description of
a picture.

Figure 1.8 Luria three-step test sequence of hand positions (first—edge—palm) is

shown.

• Articulation (abnormal in bulbar, cerebellar, and basal ganglia disorders)
• Fluency—in nonfluent speech reduced rate of word production and
short phrases
• Grammar—lack of pronouns, prepositions, and errors of tense.
Correlates with nonfluent language.
• Paraphasic errors—word substitution, e.g., black for blank (similar
sounding = phonemic) or apple for pear (meaning-based = semantic)
• Prosody—loss of intonation, pitch, and stress occur in right hemisphere
lesions but also in nonfluent speech and in articulatory disorders
• Naming. Record 10 items—a mixture of common and uncommon
objects, e.g., pen, watch, sleeve, buckle, lapel.

• Comprehension:
• Single words—point to objects in the room, e.g., door, ceiling
• Complex instructions—e.g., “Pick up the piece of paper, fold it in
half, and give it to me”
• Conceptual—e.g.,”What is the color of a banana?” “What is the
name of item in the kitchen that enables you to cut?”
• Repetition, e.g., “A koala is not really a bear,” “Shiver me timbers”
• Reading a passage (see example in Box 1.1) usually parallels spoken
language problems. Occasionally alexia can occur without aphasia.
• Writing—ask patient to write any novel sentence. Dictate a sentence,
e.g., “The cat sat on the mat.”
Calculation Simple arithmetic (addition, subtraction).
Praxis skills First to command and, if not possible, then by imitation
“show me how you would”:
• Blow a kiss (buccofacial)
• Wave goodbye (limb gestures)
• Hammer a nail (object use)

7 Nondominant (usually right) hemisphere function
Neglect
• Sensory neglect: patient ignores visual, tactile, and auditory stimuli from
left side.
• Sensory extinction: patient responds to visual or tactile stimulus from
each side separately, but when bilateral stimuli presented ignores
neglected side.
• Hemispatial neglect: in drawing a clock face, the left side of clock is omitted.
Often all numbers are drawn on the right hemisphere of the clock.
• Dressing apraxia: patient unable to dress, e.g., shirt inside out.
• Constructional ability. Copy shapes, e.g., overlapping pentagons
(see Fig. 1.9).
• Prosopagnosia: patient demonstrates impaired facial recognition.

CHAPTER 1

Neurological history and examination

Box 1.1 Example of passage for reading
Most visitors to our park are under the impression that the best way
to prevent being injured in a stampede is simply to avoid large herds
of grazing animals. Unfortunately, smaller groups of animals may be just
as dangerous. As few as three bison, if startled or upset, could trample
upon a traveler and cause serious harm. While you are here, feel free to
hike the park’s many paths and enjoy the rustic beauty of the Michigan
countryside. However, if you see a group of three or more bison, I would
encourage you to back away slowly.

Figure 1.9 Overlapping pentagons from the mini-mental state examination (MMSE).

The mini-mental state examination
(MMSE)
Commonly used bedside test (see Table 1.10).1 Caveats include the
following:
• Take into account age, education, and culture.
• Insensitive to focal deficits, especially frontal lobe
• Cut-off score is 24/30, but patients with superior background IQ may
perform well despite significant cognitive impairment.
• The MMSE tests multiple areas of cognition but does not adequately
evaluate executive function (judgment, insight). The Montreal Cognitive
Assessment (MoCA) is probably a better screening tool for dementia.
However, the MMSE is used more commonly, so the scores may have
more meaning to other practitioners who see the patient.

Score 1 point for each stage of command correctly
executed.
Reading
Ask patient to read a command on paper, e.g., “Close
your eyes,” and to execute it.
Writing
Ask patient to write a sentence. To score 1 it must be
sensible and must contain a noun and a verb.

CHAPTER 3

Common clinical presentations

Delirium
Delirium is a disturbance of consciousness accompanied by a change in
cognition not explained by a preexisting or progressive dementia, developing over a short period of time (hours to a day) and with a fluctuating
course. The following features are seen:
• Reduced awareness of the environment (disorientation) associated
with difficulties with attention (focusing, maintaining, or shifting)
• Cognitive impairment
• Memory impairment and language disturbance (e.g., dysnomia,
dysgraphia)
• Perceptual disturbance (e.g., misinterpretation, illusions,
hallucinations)
• Fluctuating course with symptoms often worse at night
Associated features include the following:
• Disruption of sleep–wake cycle
• Increased or decreased psychomotor activity
• Emotional disturbances (anxiety, anger, fear, depression, irritability,
euphoria, apathy) with rapid shift of state at times

Etiology
• Focal brain disorders
• Head injury, stroke, increased intracranial pressure, intracranial
infection, seizures
• Systemic Illness
• Infection, cardiovascular compromise, pulmonary compromise,
endocrine abnormalities
• Medications/substances
• Intoxication
• Withdrawal

Diagnosis
• History and examination
• Complete blood count with differential and platelet count (CBC-PD),
electrolytes, kidney and liver function, glucose
• Urine analysis (UA) and culture, blood cultures, skin examination, chest
radiograph (CXR)
• Thyroid studies, cardiac enzymes, blood gases
• Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and syphilis testing
• Toxicology screen
• Lumbar puncture
• Electroencephalogram (EEG)
• Head computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)

Management
•
•
•
•
•
•

Correct metabolic abnormalities
Treat infection or other underlying medical issues
Assess medications
Benzodiazepines for alcohol and substance withdrawal
Antipsychotics for behavioral control in appropriate cases
Provide reorientation

LOSS OF CONSCIOUSNESS

• Assess and correct sensory deprivation (glasses, hearing aids)
• Try to restore sleep–wake cycle
Delirium occurs in 10%–20% of hospitalized patients, with highest rates in
the frail and elderly. Predisposing factors are age, presence of dementia,
and impaired physical or mental health.

Loss of consciousness
This is a common problem.
• Obtaining a history (from patient and/or eyewitness) is essential.
• Cause may remain idiopathic in up to ~40% of patients.
• Advise the patient about implications for driving in accordance with
state guidelines. Discuss safety issues (avoidance of climbing, operating
dangerous machinery, swimming alone, bathing alone).

Etiology
Neurological causes
• Epileptic seizures—the most common cause
• Raised intracranial pressure (ICP); tumor, especially posterior fossa
lesions; hydrocephalus due to, e.g., colloid cyst
• Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH)
• Sleep disorders (narcolepsy, cataplexy)
• Basilar artery migraine (rare)
• Cerebrovascular disease (rare, unless massive stroke or brainstem)
Neurally mediated syncope (neurocardiogenic)
• Vasodepressor syncope (hereditary disposition; common in young
women; seen with heat, alcohol intake, hunger, pain, strong emotion),
the most common cause
• Carotid sinus syncope
• Situational syncope (cough, micturition, valsalva maneuvers)
• Vasovagal events
Cardiac syncope
• Cardiac arrhythmias (reduced cardiac output due to brady- or
tachyarrythmias, asystole), the most common cause
• Structural cardiopulmonary disease (aortic stenosis, hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy, pulmonary embolus, cardiac tamponade)
• Depleted intravascular volume (hemorrhage, dehydration)
Orthostatic or postural hypotension
• Drugs, the most common cause (e.g., vasodilators, antidepressants,
L-dopa preparations)
• Autonomic neuropathy (Guillain–Barre syndrome, diabetes, amyloid)
• Autonomic failure (multiple system atrophy [MSA], PD)
• Addison disease

CHAPTER 3

Common clinical presentations

• Hypoxia
Psychiatric disorders
• Psychogenic nonepileptic attacks (the most common cause).

Diagnosis
See Table 3.1. Key points of history aid in diagnosis.

Investigations
Consider the following:
• Blood: CBC (anemia); glucose (especially in diabetics or if preprandial);
basic metabolic panel (electrolytes)
• Serial blood pressure readings supine and standing to detect immediate
or delayed orthostatic hypotension
• Electrocardiogram (ECG); Holter monitor; echocardiogram for cardiac
syncope
• Tilt table testing: sensitive for syncopal tendencies
• EEG by itself does not diagnose (or rule out) epilepsy. Fifty percent
false-negative rate for interictal EEG in patients with epilepsy. Reduced
to 30% by repeating and 20% with sleep-deprived EEG. False-positive
EEG in up to 2% healthy young adults.
• Ictal video-EEG-telemetry most sensitive and specific test for epilepsy.
Note: frontal lobe epileptic seizures may appear normal even on ictal EEG.
• Imaging—Head CT or MRI (preferable)—for focal seizures, focal signs,
or signs and symptoms of increased ICP.

ACUTE VERTIGO

Acute vertigo
Vertigo is the illusion of rotation caused by asymmetry of neural activity
between the right and left vestibular nuclei. Bilateral damage does not
cause vertigo.
It is essential to determine if the vertigo is central or peripheral because
cerebellar infarction/hemorrhage can be life-threatening and require neurosurgical intervention.

Etiology
Mechanical
• Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV): loose calcium carbonate
crystals (otoliths) moving within a semicircular canal with head movement
and change of position (most common cause of acute vertigo).
Infectious
• Acute vestibular neuritis or labyrinthitis, presumed viral, affects lateral
semicircular canal function.
Vascular
• Infarction resulting from occlusion of the anterior vestibular artery,
a branch of the internal auditory artery from the anterior inferior
cerebellar artery (AICA).
• Brainstem stroke, with associated signs (e.g., Horner syndrome,
dysarthria, incoordination, diplopia, facial numbness)
• Inferior cerebellar infarction can present with only vertigo, nystagmus,
and postural instability.
• Vertebrobasilar ischemia, with associated brainstem signs
Inflammatory
• Multiple sclerosis can produce an evolving vestibular syndrome with a
plaque around the 8th nerve root entry zone.
Structural
• Perilymphatic fistula, spontaneous or traumatic
Metabolic
• Meniere syndrome: endolymphatic hydrops
• Drug toxicity

Clinical features
Clinical presentation is with acute-onset vertigo, nausea, and vomiting.
Spontaneous nystagmus
• Peripheral origin is indicated by the following characteristics:
• Horizontal with a torsional component
• Does not change direction with a change in gaze
• Slow phase toward affected ear; fast phase toward unaffected ear
• Decreased by visual fixation. At bedside, remove fixation and assess
nystagmus using Fresnel lenses, blank sheet of paper in front of
patient’s eyes, or an ophthalmoscope focused on the optic disc with
the patient’s other eye covered. Nystagmus should be evident in
the primary position. Note that the direction of the nystagmus is
inverted when viewed through the ophthalmoscope.

55

56

CHAPTER 3

Common clinical presentations

• Central origin is indicated by the following characteristics:
• Often purely horizontal or vertical or torsional
• Changes in direction with changes in the position of the gaze (i.e.,
bi- or multidirectional).
• Visual fixation has little effect on nystagmus of central origin.
• Caveat: horizontal—torsional nystagmus may occur in both peripheral
and central disorders.
The head thrust test: a bedside test of the horizontal vestibulo-ocular
reflex (see Fig. 3.1).
• Indicates absent lateral semicircular canal function on affected side
• If a catch-up saccade occurs in one direction and not the other, this
indicates a peripheral vestibular lesion on that side within the labyrinth
or the 8th nerve, including the root entry zone in the brainstem.
Fukuda or Unterberger test Marching in place (60 steps) with eyes
closed and arms out. Positive test—patient veers to side of the lesion (>45
degrees). Patients with cerebellar lesion are unable to stand unaided to do
test. Does not discriminate between central and peripheral causes.
Other signs
• Patients with a peripheral lesion can typically stand but veer/tilt to the
side of the lesion. Those with a central lesion are often unable to stand
without support.
• If signs are not typically peripheral, then assume central and investigate.

Figure 3.1 The head thrust test. The examiner turns the patient’s head as rapidly

as possible about 15º to one side and observes the ability of the patient to keep
fixating on a distant target. The patient illustrated has a right peripheral lesion
with a severe loss of right lateral semicircular canal function. While the examiner
turns the patient’s head toward the normal left side (top row), the patient is able
to keep fixating on target. By contrast, when the examiner turns the patient’s head
to the right, the vestibulo-ocular reflex fails and the patient cannot keep fixating
on target (e) so that she needs to make a voluntary rapid eye movement, that
is, a saccade, back to target (f) after the head impulse has finished; this can be
easily observed by the examiner. It is essential that the head is turned as rapidly
as possible; otherwise smooth pursuit eye movements will compensate for the
head turn. (Reproduced with permission from Halmagyi, GM [2005]. Diagnosis and
management of vertigo. Clin Med 5(2):159–165. Royal College of Physicians.)

ACUTE VERTIGO

Recurrent attacks of acute vertigo May be due to one of the following:
• BPPV
• Ménière disease
• Migraine
• Posterior circulation transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) (rare); brief
crescendo of attacks heralding stroke. Some may be associated with
diplopia, dysarthria, or facial numbness.
• Episodic ataxia
Differential diagnosis (see Table 3.2)

Management
• If peripheral, treat with vestibular sedatives such as benzodiazepines
(e.g., diazepam 5–10 mg q12hr, or antihistamines, e.g., meclizine 25–50
mg q6hr). Antiemetics and anticholinergice drugs (scopolamine patch)
may also be used. Symptoms always resolve in a few days due to
vestibular compensatory mechanisms. If BPPV suspected, assess with
Dix-Hallpike maneuver (Fig. 3.2) and treat with Epley maneuver
(Fig. 3.3) for resolution.

• If central, consider CT to exclude a cerebellar infarction or
hemorrhage. MRI is more sensitive for detection of posterior fossa
infarcts. Infarction with cerebral edema may result in hydrocephalus,
requiring urgent shunting and/or decompression.
• Many posterior circulation infarcts are due to cardiogenic embolism.
• ECG, 24-hour ECG, transthoracic and/or trans-esophageal echo

CHAPTER 3

Common clinical presentations

Acute headache (thunderclap headache)
• Two percent of visits to the emergency department (ED) are due to
headache.
• In patients with “worst-ever” headache and a normal neurological
examination, 12% may have a subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). If
neurological examination is abnormal, this becomes 25%. The diagnosis
of SAH is missed initially in up to 32% of cases.
“Thunderclap headache” may be defined as an abrupt onset, often a “worstever” headache that is maximal in seconds but may develop in minutes.

Differential diagnoses
Vascular causes
• SAH
• Carotid and vertebral artery dissection
• Cerebral venous thrombosis
• Arterial hypertension
• Temporal arteritis
Nonvascular causes
• Meningoencephalitis
• Intermittent hydrocephalus (colloid cyst of the 3rd ventricle)
• Spontaneous intracranial hypotension
Primary headache syndromes
• Coital cephalgia (headache associated with sexual activity)
• Crash migraine
• Benign cough and exertional headache
• Icepick or idiopathic stabbing headache
• Exploding head syndrome

Clinical features
The “red flags” in a patient with acute headache include the following:
• “Worst-ever” headache
• Onset with exertion (20% of SAH occur with exertion, e.g., sexual
intercourse)
• Impaired alertness or conscious level, neck stiffness, progressive
neurological deterioration
• Abnormal neurological examination (3rd or 6th nerve palsy),
papilledema, subhyaloid hemorrhage, hemiparesis, or diplegia (anterior
communicating aneurysm)
• Loss of visual acuity or visual fields; tenderness to palpation of
temporal arteries

Investigations
All patients should have a CT scan to assess for hemorrhage, focal mass
effect, or signs of increased intracranial pressure.
Five percent of CT scans in patients with SAH are normal initially.
Sensitivity to detect blood decreases with time, from 95% on day 1, 50%
on day 7, 30% on day 14, to almost 0% on day 21.

ACUTE HEADACHE (THUNDERCLAP HEADACHE)

If the CT scan is negative, an LP should be performed providing there are
no contraindications (e.g., signs of increased ICP).
• Always measure opening pressure—elevated in (60% of) SAH, in
cerebral venous thrombosis, and in meningitis.
• Sample should be centrifuged immediately and the CSF compared
to plain water in a glass tube against a white background. Although
spectrophotometry is more sensitive than visual inspection in looking
for xanthochromia, it is not widely available.
• In SAH, usually >100,000 RBC + 1–3 WBC per 1000 RBC. If there are
a lot more white cells, consider meningitis complicated by a traumatic
tap. (See Table 3.3.) Alternatively, after a few days following a SAH, a
meningitic reaction may occur.
• Xanthochromia, resulting from breakdown of hemoglobin to
oxyhemoglobin (pink) and bilirubin (yellow), may take at least 12 hours
to develop; hence the recommendations to delay LP until 12 hours
after ictus unless meningitis is a strong possibility. This may disappear
after 14 days. (See Table 3.4.)
• Other causes of xanthochromia: jaundice, elevated CSF protein
(>1.5 g/L), malignant melanoma, and rifampicin. If CT is positive or
there is persistently bloody CSF or xanthochromia by visual inspection,
cerebral angiography and a neurosurgical opinion are necessary.

CHAPTER 3

Common clinical presentations

Acute neuromuscular weakness
Acute flaccid paralysis may be due to disorders of:
• Nerve
• Muscle
• Neuromuscular junction
In the early stages of an acute myelopathy due to trauma or an intraspinal
hemorrhage or myelitis due to inflammatory or infectious causes, clinical
signs may resemble those of a peripheral rather than a central disorder.

Clinical features
• The tempo of progression will give a clue to etiology—sudden-onset
paraparesis, e.g., is most likely to be due to a vascular insult to the
spinal cord such as anterior spinal artery (ASA) thrombosis.
• Most of the neuromuscular causes tend to have a subacute course
progressing over a few days.
• Exceptions are the periodic paralyses (both hyperkalemic and
hypokalemic). Key finding is depressed or absent reflexes, which will
also be found in weakness due to secondary hypokalemia. In the
periodic paralyses, attacks may last minutes or hours in hyperK-PP and
hours/days in hypoK-PP.
• Significant sensory deficit is unusual in Guillain–Barre syndrome (GBS),
whereas a pure motor deficit without sensory loss is unusual in vasculitic
neuropathy.
• A sensory level and sphincter dysfunction implies a spinal cord
disorder. Spinal cord compression without pain and a sensory level are
unusual.
• Back pain (severe) may be a feature of GBS.
• Autonomic dysfunction occurs in GBS, but pupillary dilatation and
hypersalivation are found in botulism. Persistent hypertension and
tachycardia in association with pure motor weakness occurs in
porphyria.

Differential diagnosis See Table 3.5.

Acute focal neurological syndromes
In patients who present with acute focal neurological deficit, the history
and examination should point to the site of pathology and to the possible
pathological mechanism(s).

Etiology of acute focal neurological symptoms and signs
•
•
•
•

TIA/stroke
Migraine aura
Partial (focal) seizure
Intracranial structural lesions
• Tumor (hemorrhage or blockage of CSF flow)
• Vascular rupture
• Subdural or epidural hematoma, arteriovenous malformation
(AVM), aneurysm
• Multiple sclerosis and inflammatory central nervous system (CNS)
disorders
• Metabolic disorders

ACUTE FOCAL NEUROLOGICAL SYNDROMES

• Hypoglycemia
• Hypo- and hypercalcemia
• Wernicke encephalopathy
• Meningoencephalitis
• Cerebral abscess
• Associated vasculitis
• Specific organisms, e.g., herpes simplex and temporal lobes, Listeria
monocytogenes and brainstem involvement
• Other disorders
• Myasthenia gravis
• Hyperventilation and panic attacks
• Somatization disorders

Clinical notes
Onset of symptoms
• Sudden onset of focal neurological dysfunction without warning
suggests a vascular etiology.
• Slow progression (“march”) of symptoms over a few seconds suggests
an ictal phenomenon.
• Progression over minutes or hours points to a migrainous diathesis.
• Exceptions to these rules occur since occasionally a stroke may
progress in a stepwise manner over hours or days.
• Gradual development of focal neurological deficit over days or weeks
and months indicates a space-occupying lesion such as tumor.
Duration of symptoms Only factor that distinguishes a TIA from a stroke
is the duration of TIA is <24 hours although most episodes last only a few
minutes. MRI imaging may or may not reveal infarction.
Nature of symptoms
• Cerebrovascular events cause negative symptoms and signs, i.e., loss of
sensory, motor, language, or visual function.
• Ictal events generally cause positive phenomena such as tingling in an
arm or leg.
• Migraine may cause both positive and negative symptoms and
signs—tingling marching up the arm and dysphasia.
• Space-occupying lesions will result in a progressive loss of function or
may trigger positive ictal symptoms.
Additional symptoms and signs
• Associated throbbing unilateral headache during or after the
development of neurological symptoms point to migraine, but
headache occurs in 15% of patients with TIAs, 25% of patients with
acute ischemic stroke, and all cases of subarachnoid hemorrhage.
• Carotid and vertebral artery dissection may cause focal neurological
deficits in association with head, face, neck, or ocular pain.
• In an elderly patient with monocular visual loss, temporal arteritis
needs exclusion.
• Subdural hematoma may present with an acute onset with or without
headache.

65

66

CHAPTER 3

Common clinical presentations

• Partial seizures may progress rapidly to generalized tonic clonic
seizures.
• Two percent of patients presenting with an acute stroke may have a
seizure, either partial or generalized, at onset.
• Meningoencephalitis may present with symptoms and signs such as
headache, neck stiffness, and photophobia as well as focal signs due to
an associated vasculitis.
Loss of consciousness
• TIA and ischemic stroke patients very rarely present with loss of
consciousness.
• If it does occur, the most likely causes are SAH, a large brain stem
stroke, or a massive hemispheric intracerebral hemorrhage.
• Large hemispheric ischemic strokes may progress to coma after a few
days (due to swelling and/or secondary hemorrhage).
• Following a seizure, some patients may present with a Todd paresis.

Spastic paraparesis
Bilateral upper motor neuron signs in the legs. A common presentation
caused by a variety of disorders (hereditary and acquired).

Etiology
See Table 3.6. In cases of undiagnosed spastic paraparesis, consider a trial
of L-dopa for dopa-responsive dystonia.

Clinical features
• Gait is effortful and stiff at knees and hips: “walking through mud.”
Observe gait for fixed mild flexion at knees and hips, “scissoring”
of legs, circumduction, short steps, lateral movement of trunk while
ambulating.
• Tendon reflexes are hyperactive.
• Check for a sensory level—anterior and posterior.
• In degenerative conditions the abdominal reflexes remain, e.g., motor
neuron disease.
• Patients presenting with a short history, associated back pain, and
bladder and bowel symptoms (urgency, incontinence)—emergency
assessment necessary (for cord compression).
• Lesions at lower end of spinal cord above L1 and involving cauda
equina, e.g., dural AVM, will have a mixture of upper and lower motor
neuron signs, e.g., extensor plantars and absent ankle jerks.
• Hereditary spastic paraparesis may be pure (spastic paraparesis only)
or associated in a syndromic fashion with other findings (e.g., deafness,
epilepsy, muscular atrophy, ataxia, and dementia).
• Onset early (infancy or childhood) or late (adulthood throughout the
life cycle)

CHAPTER 3

Common clinical presentations

Ataxia
Ataxia implies incoordination and results from disorders of:
• Cerebellum and its associated pathways
• Loss of proprioceptive sensory input in peripheral nerve disorders and
in spinal cord lesions affecting the posterior columns (sensory ataxia)

Cerebellar disease
Signs of cerebellar disease
• Gait ataxia—wide based, reeling. May be more apparent when turning
or stopping suddenly. When mild, only tandem gait may be impaired.
• Dysmetria—an inability to perform finger-to-nose movements
accurately with overshoot or undershoot and a similar inability on
heel/shin testing
• Dysdiadokinesia—inability to perform rapid alternating movements
• Tremor—intention or “hunting” tremor (kinetic) arising from proximal
joints (shoulder, hip). Postural (static) tremors may also occur.
• Loss of rhythm—tested by rapid tapping on the back of the hand or
tapping the heel on the opposite knee
• Hypotonia
• Dysarthria—with ataxic dysarthria as words are broken up into
syllables; impaired modulation of volume
• Eye movements—broken-up pursuit movements; overshooting
or undershooting targets with saccadic eye movements (saccadic
dysmetria). Macrosaccadic square wave jerks in primary position
(sudden short duration movements laterally with rapid correction—
may need to view optic disks to appreciate)
• Nystagmus—coarse nystagmus with the fast phase in the direction of
the lesion; multidirectional nystagmus
• Hyporeflexia
Differential diagnoses of acquired cerebellar ataxia
• Toxic: alcohol
• Drugs:
• Phenytoin
• Lithium
• Vascular:
• Ischemic stroke
• Hemorrhage
• Inflammatory: demyelination (MS, ADEM)
• Neoplastic:
• Metastases (breast, bronchus)
• Primary brain tumors (in children, pilocytic astrocytoma and
medulloblastoma)
• Paraneoplastic syndrome, associated with small-cell lung cancer
(anti Hu, anti PCA2, ANNA 3); ovarian cancer (anti Yo), breast
cancer (anti Yo and Ri), and testicular cancer (anti Ta/Ma2); Hodgkin
lymphoma (anti Tr); neuroblastoma (anti Hu); and thymoma (anti
CRMP5/CV2)

ATAXIA

• Infectious/post infectious:
• Viral cerebellitis (measles)
• SSPE
• HIV
• Miller Fisher syndrome (ataxia, areflexia, ophthalmoplegia + GQ1b
antibody)
• Prion: sporadic or variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD)
• Structural:
• Arnold–Chiari malformation

• Nutritional or GI related:
• Vitamin E deficiency;
• Thiamine (B1 deficiency) in, e.g., Wernicke encephalopathy
• Celiac disease (with myoclonus)
• Endocrine: decreased T4
Differential diagnoses of hereditary cerebellar ataxias
• In general the autosomal dominant ataxias (ADCAs) and the other
autosomal disorders that may have ataxia as an additional feature such
as HD, dentatorubral pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA), Gerstmann–
Straussler–Scheinker (GSS) tend to present >25 years of age.
• Autosomal recessive ataxias, inborn errors of metabolism,
mitochondrial disorders, and episodic ataxias present <25 years of age.
Autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias (ADCA)
• There are at least 30 spinocerebellar ataxia genes. Ataxia in
combination with any of the following—pyramidal, peripheral nerve,
ophthalmoplegia, dementia. Absence of a family history does not
exclude the possibility of diagnosis.
• SCA 2—slow saccades, upper limb areflexia
• SCA 3—dystonia, parkinsonism, facial myokymia, bulging eyes
• SCA 6—“pure cerebellar syndrome”
• SCA 7—pigmentary macular dystrophy
Recessive ataxias—See Table 3.7.
Inborn errors of metabolism
• Hexoaminidase A or B deficiency
• Adrenoleukodystrophy
• Wilson disease
Episodic ataxias—See Table 3.7.
Mitochondrial disorders with ataxia
• NARP (neuropathy, ataxia, retinitis pigmentosa)

Sensory ataxia
Clinical features
Any marked loss of proprioception will result in sensory ataxia.
• Signs of a neuropathy with loss of joint position sense
• Pseudoathetosis of fingers when arms outstretched and eyes closed
• Upper limb position sense loss is tested by attempting to bring both
horizontally outstretched index fingers together in the midline with
eyes closed.
• Heel-shin testing deteriorates with eye closure.
• Positive Romberg sign
Differential diagnoses of sensory ataxia
• Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP)
• Paraproteinemic neuropathy (IgM)

ACUTE VISUAL FAILURE

• Refsum disease (due to defect in phytanic acid metabolism. Other
features include deafness, retinitis pigmentosa). A rarer defect of
pristanate metabolism presents in a similar fashion (Massion Vernier
disease).
• Sensory ganglionitis (paraneoplastic, Sjögren syndrome, idiopathic)
• Friedreich ataxia has a significant peripheral nerve component.
• Spinal cord disorders (affecting posterior columns):
• Cervical spondylosis
• Demyelination (MS)

Acute visual failure (Table 3.8)
Monocular transient visual loss
• Amaurosis fugax due to emboli from carotid vessels or heart.
• Sudden onset lasting 5–15 minutes. Described as a curtain being
pulled downwards in front of the eye. Loss may be quadrantic or
total and may be accompanied by contralateral limb signs due to
ipsilateral hemispheric ischemia.
• Closed angle glaucoma—accompanied by halos around lights and may
not always be associated with redness and pain.
• Transient visual obscurations (TVOs) are a gray-out precipitated by
postural change or straining. Causes:
• Chronic papilledema due to increased ICP
• Hypotension and hypoperfusion
• TVOs that are gaze-evoked suggest orbital tumors.
• Retinal migraine is rare and results from transient vasospasm that
responds to calcium channel blockers.

Bilateral, transient visual loss
• Usually due to transient visual cortical dysfunction.
• In patients under the age of 40 years this is most commonly due to
migraine.
• Other causes include thromboembolism, hypotension, or
hyperviscosity.
• In children may occur post-trauma or as part of the benign occipital
epilepsy syndrome in childhood.

Nonprogressive unilateral sudden visual loss
• Usually due to ischemia of the optic nerve or retina
• Anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (AION) presents with infarction of
the optic disc and is due to atherosclerosis or temporal arteritis.
• Optic nerve infarction due to embolism is rare.
• Retrobulbar optic nerve infarction (or posterior ischemic optic
neuropathy) occurs in the setting of cerebral hypoperfusion
perioperatively.
• Central retinal artery or branch occlusion is due to emboli or
arteriosclerosis. Field defects may be altitudinal, quadrantic, or total. A
cherry red spot at the macula is pathognomonic.

• Central retinal vein occlusion occurs in hypertensives, diabetics, or
those with a thrombophilia. A hemorrhagic retinopathy results in a
dense central scotoma with preserved peripheral vision.
• Idiopathic central serous chorioretinopathy results from leakage of fluid
into the subretinal space. Symptoms include a positive scotoma (black
or gray spot in the visual field), metamorphopsia (distortion of images),
or micropsia. Fluorescein angiography is necessary for diagnosis.
• Retinal and vitreous hemorrhage

COMA

Nonprogressive bilateral sudden visual loss
• Usually a result of an infarct in the visual radiation causing a
homonymous hemianopia
• Bilateral occipital infarcts can result in tubular or checkerboard visual
fields or total cortical blindness.
• Anton syndrome due to bilateral parieto-occipital infarcts causes
cortical blindness accompanied by denial and confabulation.
• Leber hereditary optic neuropathy
• Maternally transmitted mitochondrial disorder
• Mutations have been identified at positions 11778, 3460, 15257, and
14484.
• Presentation is in young men with a rapid permanent loss of central
vision.
• In the acute phase, typical findings include circumpapillary
telangiectatic microangiopathy, pseudopapilledema, an absence of
fluorescein leakage, and marked arteriolar narrowing.

Visual loss of sudden onset with progression (unilateral)
Usually due to acute optic neuritis. Most common cause is demyelination.
Typical symptoms
• Periocular pain and pain on eye movement
• Progressive visual loss over a few days
• Phosphenes or photopsias (spontaneous flashes of light) on movement
• Spontaneous improvement in vision
• Uhthoff phenomenon—temporary decrease in visual acuity (VA) with
increased body temperature after a bath or exercise
• Fading of vision and Pulfrich phenomenon (misperception of the
trajectory of moving objects)
Typical signs
• Decreased VA, color vision, and contrast sensitivity
• Variety of field defects including centrocecal scotoma
• Relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD)
• Optic disc may be normal or swollen.
• Associated uveitis or retinal perivenous sheathing

Coma
Coma is the state of unarousable unconsciousness. The Glasgow Coma
Scale (GCS)—see Appendix, p.442—defines coma as:
• Failure to open eyes in response to verbal command (E2)
• Motor response no better than weak flexion (M4)
• Incomprehensible sounds in response to pain (V2)

Neuroanatomy and neuropathology
Consciousness, which is the state of awareness of self and environment
with the ability to respond appropriately to stimuli, results from:
• Arousal (ascending reticular activating system)
• Awareness (cerebral cortex)

73

74

CHAPTER 3

Common clinical presentations

Coma results from damage to the RAS in the brainstem or extensive bilateral cortical damage.

Etiology
• Head injury
• Medical causes of coma:
• Cerebrovascular disease (50%)
• Hypoxic–ischemic injury (20%)
• Metabolic and infective (30%)

General assessment of coma
History Crucial to contact family, EMS personnel. Obtain PMH, travel,
drug details.
General examination
• Temperature (increased or decreased)
• Pulse and blood pressure (septicemia, Addison’s disease)
• Skin lesions (rash, needle marks, bruises, pigmentation)
• Respiration:
• Slow shallow breaths: drug intoxication
• Deep rapid respiration: metabolic acidosis
• Periodic respiration: cardiac failure, brainstem lesion
• Rapid shallow respiration: brainstem lesion
• Breath odor (alcohol, ketones, hepatic, or renal failure)
• Abdominal examination (hepatosplenomegaly in liver or
lymphoproliferative disease, polycystic kidneys)
• Otoscopy (blood)

Neurological assessment
• Check for meningismus (meningitis, SAH).
• Fundoscopy:
• Papilledema
• Subhyaloid hemorrhages (SAH)
• Retinopathy (diabetes, hypertension, infection, e.g., choroidal
tubercle, HIV)
• Level of consciousness (GCS). Note if facial injuries or
tracheostomy, verbal response unassessable.
Neurological examination: motor and sensory system
Look for asymmetry, evidence of significant cortical (decorticate) or brainstem (decerebrate) damage.
• Observe for seizure activity (focal or general: implies cortical damage)
• Tone
• Posture
• Reflexes, plantar responses
• Response to pain:
• Using a pen, press nail bed of finger and toe.
• Apply supraorbital pressure in case of damage to spinothalamic
damage in limbs. Flexor response = cortical or upper brainstem
injury; extensor response = brainstem injury.

COMA

Neurological examination: brainstem function
• Pupillary responses
• Unilateral fixed dilated pupil (3rd nerve palsy due to tentorial
herniation or posterior communicating artery aneurysm)
• Bilateral fixed dilated pupils: severe brainstem damage or atropinelike drugs used in resuscitation
• Midpoint, fixed = midbrain lesion
• Small pinpoint = pontine lesion (also opiates)
• Small, reactive pupils = diencephalic (thalamus) lesion
• Horner syndrome = hypothalamus, brainstem, or internal carotid
artery lesion
• Eye deviation
• Conjugate lateral deviation caused by ipsilateral frontal lesion or
contralateral brainstem (PPRF) lesion
• Dysconjugate eyes due to III, IV, or VI palsy or brainstem lesion
• Skew deviation in brainstem and thalamic lesions
• Spontaneous eye movements.
• Repetitive horizontal deviations (ping pong gaze) = brainstem lesion
• Retractory nystagmus (eyes jerk back into orbits) = midbrain lesion
• Downward ocular bobbing = pontine lesion
• Reflex eye movements (see Fig. 3.4).
• Oculocephalic maneuver. Head moved side to side—normally eyes
deviate to opposite side. If brainstem is affected, eyes remain fixed.
• Oculovestibular test. First check that tympanic membrane intact.
Instill 50–200 mL ice cold water into external auditory meatus:
normal tonic response = eyes deviate to side of instillation
with nystagmus and quick phase away from side of instillation.
Dysconjugate or absent response = brainstem lesion on side of
abnormal response.
• Corneal reflex

Classification of coma
Coma without focal signs or meningismus
• Hypoxic–ischemic injury
• Metabolic
• Toxic
• Postictal
Coma with meningismus
• Meningoencephalitis
• SAH
Coma with focal signs
• Hemorrhage
• Infarction
• Abscess
• Tumor
• Hypoglycemia can cause focal signs.

Investigations
• Metabolic screen
• CT scan or MRI if possible especially in coma with meningismus or
focal signs
• A normal CT does not exclude increased ICP
• EEG (see “EEG and diffuse cerebral dysfunction,” p. 396)
• If no contraindications, consider lumbar puncture.

Coma prognosis
Neurologists are often asked to prognosticate on comatose patients in
ICU so that decisions about further active treatment can be made. The
prognosis can be affected by etiology, as well as depth and duration of
coma.

BRAIN DEATH

Etiology
• Drug overdose patients have a good prognosis despite significant
impairment of brainstem function.
• Likelihood of good recovery:
• Metabolic or infection, 25%
• Hypoxic–ischemic injury, 10%
• Cerebrovascular disease or SAH, 5%

Depth of coma
Within 6 hours:
• If eye opening, 20% chance of good recovery compared to 10% if no
eye opening
• No motor response, 3% ; if flexion or better, 15%
• No noise, 8%; groaning, 30%

Duration of coma
The chance of making a good recovery decreases with time.
• By day 3, 7% will make a moderate or good recovery.
• After day 14, 2% will make a moderate or good recovery.
• Patients who remain in coma for >7–15 days will either die or remain
in a vegetative state.

Prognostic signs
The data for prognostic signs in coma are poor. No one clinical sign can
act as a predictor.
• At 24 hours, if absence of both oculovestibular and corneal reflexes
and extension to pain, in the absence of sedative drugs, then chance of
a good recovery is <3%.
• Intact pupillary and corneal responses and localization to pain
at 24 hours indicates a 40% chance of good recovery.

Brain death
Brain death represents the irreversible cessation of all functions of the
brain and brainstem. The determination of brain death is made by a physician based on accepted medical standards. The precise clinical criteria to
declare brain death may vary slightly among medical institutions.

General considerations
It is important to identify the conditions leading to brain death. In the
absence of etiology, it is difficult to be certain of irreversibility of function.
Brain death should not be declared if there is a possibility of intoxication, hypothermia, neuromuscular blockade, cardiovascular shock, or other
potentially reversible condition. Any suspected or known reversible condition must be treated and resolved prior to examination for purposes of
determining brain death.
Loss of all functions of the brain and brainstem must be carefully
documented.

77

78

CHAPTER 3

Common clinical presentations

Examination
• Absent cerebral function: the patient must be in deep coma and be
unresponsive to external stimuli
• Absent brainstem function: the following reflexes must be tested and
found to be absent:
• Pupillary light response
• Corneal reflex
• Oculocephalic reflex
• Oculovestibular reflex
• Gag reflex
• Respiratory response to hypercarbia (Box 3.1)

Optional confirmatory tests
• Radionuclide cerebral angiogram to document absence of blood flow
to brain and brainstem
• Four-vessel cerebral angiogram to document absence of blood flow to
brain and brainstem
• EEG to verify irreversible loss of cerebral cortical function EEG for the
purpose of documenting brain death must be performed according to
strict criteria of the American Electroencephalographic Society.
In general, most institutions require at least two examinations performed
by a physician (often a neurologist or neurosurgeon) not directly involved
in the care of the patient, with the examinations separated by a prescribed
number of hours based on the age of the patient. Confirmatory tests
are often used to shorten the required time interval between clinical
examinations when time is an issue, as in cases where organ donation is
a consideration.

Box 3.1 Testing the respiratory response
• Ventilate patient with 100% O2 for 10 minutes.
• Check an arterial blood gas to assure normal parameters (with high
PaO2) at onset of test.
• Disconnect ventilator; allow passive flow of oxygen
• Observe patient for 10 minutes—assessing for any sign of
respiratory attempt.
• Check another arterial blood gas to assure that PCO2 has risen
above 60 mmHg (a level adequate to stimulate respiratory effort).
• Absence of respiratory effort in presence of PCO2 above 60 mmHg
is consistent with brain death (if all other brainstem reflexes and
higher cortical function are absent)

EXCESSIVE DAYTIME SLEEPINESS

Excessive daytime sleepiness
• Epworth sleepiness scale (see box) is a useful tool in the clinic to
assess the common complaint of sleepiness.
• Anyone with sleepiness causing problems with work and driving or an
Epworth score of >12 despite having >7 hours sleep each night should
be investigated. See Box 3.2.

Causes of persistent sleepiness
• Lack of sleep:
• Inadequate time in bed
• Environmental sleep disruption, e.g., babies
• Shift work
• Sleep disruption (nonenvironmental):
• Obstructive sleep apnea/hypopnea syndrome (OSA/HS)
• Periodic limb movement disorder
• Sleepiness with normal sleep:
• Narcolepsy
• Idiopathic hypersomnolence
• Neurological causes, e.g., tumors of hypothalamus, pineal, upper
brainstem, bilateral paramedian thalamic infarcts, head injury, MS
• Drugs
• Psychological, e.g., depression, seasonal affective disorder

Causes of intermittent sleepiness
• Kleine–Levin syndrome (episodic disorder associated with bulimia,
hypersexuality)
• Catamenial hypersomnia

Obstructive sleep apnea/hypopnea syndrome (OSA/HS)
• Commonest cause of sleepiness most often found in middle-aged and
elderly men.
• Incidence: 20–50/100,000
• Risk factors:
• Fifty percent are obese.
• Retrognathia—results from excessive relaxation of the upper airway
muscles during sleep.
• Sleep fragmentation is due to repeated cycles of apnea and arousal.
• Result is increased risk of hypertension, cardiac arrhythmias, and heart
failure. Increased risk of motor vehicle accidents (sixfold).
• Investigations include a polysomnogram (PSG). Include esophageal
pressure monitoring if upper airway resistance is suspected.
Follow with multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) for confirmation of
hypersomnolence or if narcolepsy suspected.
• Assessment:
• History: snoring, witnessed apneas, headaches, daytime and
situational somnolence, caffeine use, bruxism
• Examination: Mallampati score (see Box 3.3), neck circumference,
body mass index (BMI), dental occlusion

EXCESSIVE DAYTIME SLEEPINESS

Box 3.3 Mallampati score
In sitting position, patient is asked to open mouth widely and protrude
tongue to full extent, without phonation.
Class 1: Full visibility of tonsils, uvula, and soft palate
Class 2: Visibility of hard and soft palate, upper portion of tonsils
and uvula
Class 3: Soft and hard palate and base of the uvula are visible
Class 4: Only hard palate visible

• Management:
• Weight loss
• Reduction of alcohol intake
• Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is first-line treatment.
BiPAP, dental appliances, and surgery may be considered.

Narcolepsy
• Classical tetrad:
• Sleepiness
• Hypnagogic hallucinations
• Sleep paralysis
• Cataplexy
• Onset in teens or 20s. Incidence: 0.2/100,000
• Cause may be related to a reduction of hypocretin production from
the hypothalamus.
• Sleepiness is characterized by irresistible sleep attacks in inappropriate
situations such as while eating.
• Cataplexy is due to a sudden loss of muscular tone—resulting in fall to
the ground or head drop. Facial twitching may occur. Episodes last a few
seconds but may be as long as 10 minutes. There is no loss of awareness.
Triggers include emotional outbursts such as laughing. Reflexes are
absent during cataplectic episode and present when episode is over.
• Ninety percent of narcoleptic patients are HLA DQB1*0602 (However,
this is present in at least 20% of the normal population and lacks
diagnostic specificity—cannot be used for diagnosis.)
• Multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) is the most useful investigation. It
must be performed on the day following a PSG.
Treatment
• Sleepiness:
• Scheduled naps
• Modafinil
• Adrenergic stimulant drugs
• Cataplexy:
• Tricyclic compounds (clomiprimine, imiprimine, protriptyline)

• If onset <25 years, check DYT1 gene.
• MRI especially in generalized or hemidystonia dystonia, additional
neurological signs
• Consider other genetic tests as above (e.g., HD, SCA).
• Fresh blood preparations for acanthocytes x 3 (neuroacanthocytosis)

Management

childhood or adolescent, for dopa-responsive dystonia.
• Anticholinergic drugs, e.g., trihexyphenidyl
• Benzodiazepines
• Baclofen
• If unhelpful, especially in generalized dystonia, consider dopamine
antagonists:
• Tetrabenazine
• Pimozide
• Thalamic (GPi) deep brain stimulation may be an option.

CHAPTER 4

Disorders of the peripheral nervous system

Peripheral neuropathy: introduction
and clinical approach
General considerations
• Peripheral neuropathy or polyneuropathy—diffuse peripheral nerve
lesion, often symmetrical
• Mononeuropathy—lesion of a single nerve (i.e., median, femoral, or
abducens). Often entrapment or trauma
• Mononeuritis multiplex—focal involvement of two or more individual
nerves, often asymmetric

Polyneuropathy: clinical manifestations
Age of onset varies, for example
• Childhood—CMT
• Adulthood—Diabetes
• Older adult—Paraproteinemia
Acuity of onset
• Acute—AIDP, porphyria, toxic, tick paralysis, diphtheria, vasculitic
• Chronic—B12 deficiency, paraproteinemia, diabetes, most other causes
Symptoms
• Motor symptoms—distal weakness predominates in most
neuropathies. Difficulty opening jars, tripping over feet
• Sensory symptoms—may be positive (tingling, burning) or negative
(numbness).
• Paresthesia—spontaneous abnormal sensations, which are not
unduly painful
• Dysesthesia—painful paresthesia
• Allodynia—painful sensation resulting from a nonpainful stimulus,
such as stroking
• Hyperesthesia—increased sensitivity to a stimulus
• Hyperalgesia—increased sensitivity to a painful stimulus
• Autonomic symptoms—orthostatic lightheadedness, gastroparesis,
sweating abnormalities, erectile dysfunction, tachycardia
• Differential diagnosis by pattern of symptoms
• Pattern 1: Symmetrical proximal and distal weakness with sensory
loss. (Consider CIDP, vasculitis.)
• Pattern 2: Symmetrical distal weakness with sensory loss. (Consider
diabetes, drugs and toxins, hereditary neuropathies, amyloidosis,
paraproteinemia.)
• Pattern 3: Asymmetric distal weakness and numbness. (Consider
vasculitic neuropathy, HNPP, infectious neuropathy, multifocal
trauma or entrapment.)
• Pattern 4: Asymmetric distal or proximal weakness without sensory
loss. (Consider multifocal motor neuropathy, motor neuron disease,
inclusion body myositis.)

PERIPHERAL NEUROPATHY

• Pattern 5: Asymmetric proximal and distal weakness with sensory
loss. (Consider polyradiculopathy or plexopathy, malignant
infiltration, brachial neuritis, HNPP.)
• Pattern 6: Symmetric small fiber sensory neuropathy without
weakness. (Consider diabetes, Fabry disease, amyloidosis, HIV.)
• Pattern 7: Symmetric small and large fiber sensory neuropathy
without diabetes. (Consider diabetes, drugs, toxins, paraproteinemia.)
• Pattern 8: Marked proprioceptive sensory loss. (Consider
paraneoplastic, B6 toxicity, Sjogren, HIV.)
• Pattern 9: Autonomic predominant. (Consider autoimmune,
amyloidosis, diabetes, AIDP.)
• Pattern 10: Neuropathy with cranial nerve involvement. (Consider
Lyme, HIV, AIDP, sarcoidosis, malignant infiltration, Tangier disease,
trichloroethylene toxicity, anti-Gd1b neuropathy.)
Signs
• Large-fiber neuropathy
• Loss of vibration and position sense
• Diminished or absent reflexes
• Positive Romberg sign
• Pseudoathetosis (involuntary movements of the fingers when the
arms are held out with the eyes shut)
• Small-fiber neuropathy
• Loss of pain and temperature sensation
• Reflexes may be normal. (Ia afferent fibers are large and well
myelinated.)
• Cutaneous sensory loss in a stocking-glove distribution
• Foot deformities such as pes cavus, pes planus, or hammertoes may
indicate a hereditary neuropathy.
• Nerve thickening may be seen in CMT, leprosy, Refsum disease,
amyloidosis, or HNPP.
• Autonomic dysfunction
• Miosis
• Orthostatic hypotension (BP supine and erect after 3 minutes)

Diagnosis
Acute neuropathies
• Guillain–Barre syndrome (LP, EMG)
• Vascultic neuropathy (see later)
• Acute intermittent porphyria (urine porphyrins, RBC porphobilinogen
deaminase activity)
• Diphtheria (EMG, throat swab)
• Heavy metal or metalloid poisoning (arsenic, lead, thallium levels)
• Tick paralysis (EMG)
Chronic neuropathies
• Mononeuropathy—entrapment, trauma (EMG)
• Multiple mononeuropathies
• Vasculitis (ESR, EMG, nerve biopsy)
• Isolated peripheral nervous system vasculitis

ACQUIRED POLYNEUROPATHIES

Investigations in peripheral nerve disorders
• EMG and nerve conduction studies
• Can distinguish polyneuropathy from polyradiculopathy or
plexopathy
• Can identify mononeuropathy and mononeuritis multiplex
• Can distinguish axonal and demyelinating neuropathies
• Can identify subclinical sensory or motor involvement
• Can distinguish hereditary from acquired demyelinating
neuropathies
• Blood tests (see earlier)
• First line: 75 gram 2 hour oral glucose tolerance test, B12, TSH, SPEP,
immunofixation, ESR, renal and liver function tests
• Second line: ANA, dsDNA, anti-Ro, anti-La, HIV, Lyme
• Third line: Others, as suspected (see earlier)
• CSF examination
• Should be considered when AIDP/CIDP is suspected, but nerve
conduction studies are equivocal. High CSF protein with normal cell
counts supports this diagnosis
• Should be considered in any rapidly progressive undiagnosed
neuropathy. High CSF protein, pleocytosis, oligoclonal bands suggest
a demyelinating or inflammatory process.
• Should be considered for undiagnosed polyradiculopathy or
polycranial neuropathy. CSF should be examined for evidence of
malignancy, sarcoidosis, or infection.
• Nerve biopsy (sural, radial, superficial peroneal)
• Can distinguish normal nerve (Fig 4.9) from one with axonal loss
(Fig 4.10), but not indicated for most neuropathies.
• Most useful when suspecting vasculitis, especially if there is no clear
evidence of systemic vasculitis
• Rarely useful for diagnosing:
— Amyloidosis (fat pad and rectal biopsy are preferred)
— Hereditary neuropathy (if genetic tests negative) (See Fig 4.11)
— CIDP (if NCS and CSF not supportive)
— Sarcoid neuropathy
— Complications include infection, persistent pain, and numbness

Acquired polyneuropathies
Diabetic neuropathies
Epidemiology: Commonest cause of neuropathy worldwide. Eight percent
have neuropathy at diagnosis; 50% after 25 years.
Diagnosis
• Diabetes = fasting glucose >126, 2 hr postprandial glucose of
200 mg/dL
• Impaired fasting glucose = fasting glucose 100–125 mg/dL
• Impaired glucose tolerance = 2 hr postprandial glucose 140–199 mg/dL

95

96

CHAPTER 4

Disorders of the peripheral nervous system

Classification of diabetic neuropathies
• Diabetic polyneuropathy
• Length dependent, painful sensory > motor neuropathy
• Autonomic dysfunction is common.
• Nerve conduction studies show length-dependent axonal
polyneuropathy. May be normal if only small fibers involved.
• Treatment is foot care, control of hyperglycemia, and medications for
neuropathic pain (i.e., gabapentin, nortriptyline, duloxetine, pregabalin).
• Diabetic neuropathic cachexia
• Fulminant painful neuropathy associated with weight loss and
depression
• Usually in older men with new onset or poorly controlled diabetes
• Spontaneous recovery with good diabetic control
• Diabetic amyotrophy
• Clinical manifestations
— Abrupt onset of severe pain in backs, hips, and thighs followed by
weakness and wasting of proximal muscles > distal muscles
— Usually unilateral, but may progress to be bilateral
— Associated with weight loss
• Differential: Vasculitis, malignant infiltration
• Investigations
— Nerve conduction studies usually show distal sensorimotor
polyneuropathy
— Needle EMG shows denervation in proximal lower extremity
muscles including paraspinals
— Consider MRI to rule out structural or infiltrative process
causing radiculopathy or plexopathy
Management
— Spontaneous recovery over 1–3 years
— Methylprednisolone (1g iv tiw x 1, then qweek x 3, then q2
weeks x 4) may speed recovery
— IVIG reported to be beneficial as well
• Diabetic cranial neuropathies
• Oculomotor (III) palsy—pupil sparing
• Abducens (VI) palsy
• Diabetic mononeuropathies—prone to entrapment syndromes.
Surgery should be considered if motor involvement, but results may
not be as good as in nondiabetics.
• Median at the wrist
• Ulnar at the elbow
• Common peroneal at the fibular neck

Guillain–Barre syndrome
Acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (AIDP)
• Epidemiology: The most common cause of acute neuromuscular
weakness. Annual incidence 1–2/100,000
• Clinical features
• Two-thirds are preceded by a GI or upper respiratory tract
infection (Campylobacter jejuni, CMV, EBV, haemophilus influenzae,
mycoplasma). Neurologic symptoms begin 5 days to 3 weeks later.

ACQUIRED POLYNEUROPATHIES

• Ascending weakness. Proximal weakness may occur as well because
of root demyelination
• Paresthesias common. Actual sensory loss is variable.
• Progressive over days to weeks, nadir by 4 weeks
• Often associated with back pain
• Involvement of cranial nerves can cause facial and bulbar weakness.
• Up to 25% have respiratory involvement requiring mechanical
ventilation.
• Autonomic dysfunction (hypotension, hypertension, cardiac
arrhythmia)
• Early loss of reflexes
• Diagnostic studies
• Nerve conduction studies may be normal early in the course of the
disease
• Progressive prolongation of F-responses, motor latencies, and
motor conduction velocities. Conduction block correlates with
degree of weakness.
• Elevated CSF protein (may be normal first few days). Little or no
CSF pleocytosis, unless associated with HIV or Lyme.
• Management
• IVIG 0.4 g/kg/day x 5 days
• Plasma exchange (2–5 exchanges, depending on the severity of the
disease)
• No benefit from corticosteroids
• Supportive measures
— Follow vital capacity (VC) and negative inspiratory force (NIF). If
VC <20 mL/kg (1.5 L for an average adult) or NIF is worse than
–30 cm H2O, transfer patient to the ICU and consider elective
intubation. Do not wait for O2 saturation or PO2 to drop.
— Swallowing assessment
— Cardiac monitoring in all patients who are severely affected, at
least until they start to improve
— Treat neuropathic pain (gabapentin, pregabalin, or tramadol).
Avoid tricyclic antidepressants early, which may lower threshold
for arrhythmia.
— DVT prophylaxis
— Bowel regimen for constipation
— Physical therapy to prevent contractures and speed recovery of
function
• Prognosis
• Mortality is 5%.
• Most patients recover over many months.
• Untreated, about 35% of patients have residual weakness, atrophy,
hyporeflexia, and facial weakness.
• Partial recovery followed by relapse is present in <10% of patients.
Recurrence after full recovery is 2%.
• Poor outcome associated with
— Older age
— Preceding diarrheal illness

CHAPTER 4

Disorders of the peripheral nervous system

— Rapid deterioration and severe weakness
— Electrically inexcitable nerves and muscle wasting
Acute motor axonal neuropathy (AMAN)
• Little or no demyelination
• Often associated with Campylobacter jejuni infection

Acute sensory neuropathy
Acute pandysautonomia

Chronic inflammatory demyelinating
polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP)
Epidemiology: Incidence 0.15/100,000. Prevalence: 1.24–1.9/100,000. Mean
age of onset 47 years
Clinical manifestations
• Onset is insidious or acute, and course is progressive or relapsing.
• Weakness
• Can be both distal and proximal limbs
• Weakness out of proportion to wasting, especially early (suggests
conduction block without axonal loss)
• Face, extra-ocular muscles, and respiratory muscles usually spared
• No autonomic involvement
• Large-fiber sensory loss, sometimes associated with pseudoathetosis
and tremor
• Generalized areflexia
• Thickened nerves
Clinical variants
• Focal or multifocal (monomelic) presentation
• Sensory ataxic variant. May resemble sensory ganglionopathy
• Increased frequency in diabetes, but difficult to diagnose because
superimposed axonal neuropathy. Diabetes can also cause elevated
CSF protein.
• CNS demyelination with CIDP has been reported.
Investigations
• Nerve conduction studies show prolonged F-responses and prolonged
conduction velocities, prolonged latencies, and conduction block with
temporal dispersion at nonentrapment sites.
• Denervation on EMG suggests superimposed axonal loss.

ACQUIRED POLYNEUROPATHIES

• CSF shows elevated protein (although not as uniformly as in AIDP) and
normal cell counts. Oligoclonal bands may be positive.
• Differential diagnosis
• Hereditary: CMT1a, CMT1b, CMT1X, HNPP, Refsum
• Toxic: Amiodarone, arsenic, hexacarbons
• Paraproteinemic: myeloma, POEMS, Waldenstrom
macroglobulinemia
• Screen for monoclonal gammopathy with SPEP and immunofixation.
If present, further investigations are warranted to exclude malignancy.
If IgM monoclonal protein is present, screen for myelin-associated
glycoprotein (MAG) antibodies, which are treated differently.
• Management (see Fig. 4.1)
• Second line (no RCT data)
• Azathioprine 2–3 mg/kg/day
• Mycophenolate 1000 mg BID
• Cyclosporine 2–3 mg/kg/day
• Cyclophosphamide, oral 1–2 mg/kg/day or IV 1–3 mg (pulsed)
• If the patient has antibodies to MAG, IVIG and steroids are less likely to
work. Rituximab (monoclonal antibody against CD20) shows promise.

muscles
• Sensory loss is usually inconspicuous.
• May follow the pattern of a plexopathy (20%), mononeuropathy (30%),
or multiple mononeuropathies (50%)
• May follow antecedent illness, trauma, surgery, or vaccination
Prognosis—Spontaneous recovery usually within 3 months to 3 years
Treatment
• Supportive (pain medicines, including narcotics)
• Steroids may help with pain but do not alter course
• IVIG reported to speed recovery if given very early in course

CHAPTER 4

Disorders of the peripheral nervous system

Radiation plexopathy
• Latent period of 1–2 years or longer
• Weakness and atrophy, usually in proximal upper extremity
• Differentiating radiation plexopathy from tumor recurrence
• Radiation plexopathy may cause myokymia
• Radiation plexopathy more likely to affect upper trunk (recurrent
breast and lung carcinoma are more likely to affect the lower trunk)
• Pain much more common and severe in recurrent carcinoma

Hereditary neuropathies
Figure 4.2 shows a flowchart for demyelinating hereditary neuropathies.

Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease
Clinical manifestations
• Most present in childhood or adolescence
• Pes cavus or other foot deformities
• Scoliosis
• Slowly progressive distal to proximal weakness
• Sensory symptoms are generally mild.
Classification by nerve conduction studies
• Demyelinating (CMT1)—upper extremity motor nerve conduction
velocity <38 m/s. Conduction block and temporal dispersion are rare.
• Axonal (CMT2)—upper limb motor conduction velocities >38 m/s
• Intermediate—upper limb motor conduction velocity 25–45 m/s may
indicate CMT1X
Demyelinating neuropathy (CMT1)
• CMT1A is the most common form. AD. 70% caused by duplication of
the peripheral myelin protein (PMP22) gene on chromosome 17
• CMT1B. Caused by mutation of human myelin protein zero (P0) on
chromosome 1
• Dejerine-Sottas disease and congenital hypomyelinating neuropathies,
which present in the first decade and are more severe, characterized
by point mutations in PMP22, P0, and EGR2.
• CMT1X. Caused by mutation in connexin-32 gene
• Patchy demyelination with intermediate conduction velocities
• Women may be affected, but phenotype is less severe.
• Rare hearing loss or stroke-like episodes with altitude change
Axonal neuropathy (CMT2)
• May be AD or AR
• Fewer genes identified or commercially available for testing
• Mitofusin 2 (MFN2) associated with AD or sporadic neuropathy
Diagnosis
• EMG/NCV can direct laboratory testing by determining if it is axonal
or demyelinating.

• Laboratory—gene tests are available for PMP22, connexin 32, P0,
EGR2, MFN2, and a few other more rare forms.
• Nerve biopsy—occasionally can be useful in excluding other causes of
neuropathy (i.e., Refsum disease, vasculitis).
• CSF protein may be mildly elevated, which can make it difficult to
distinguish from CIDP in certain clinical situations.
Prognosis—very slowly progressive. Most do not significantly affect life
span.

Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies
(HNLPP)
AD. Caused by a deletion of PMP22 gene on chromosome 17
Clinical manifestations
• Recurrent pressure palsies
• Recurrent brachial plexopathy
• Transient sensory symptoms
• Nerve conductions show patchy demyelination, mild generalized
neuropathy

to determine prognosis.
• Differential diagnosis: HIV, Lyme, facial tumor, sarcoidosis, MelkerssonRosenthal syndrome
Treatment
• Artificial tears, protective goggles, eye patch at night

mononeuropathy at the wrist and anterior interosseous
mononeuropathy, plus wrist flexion and more weakness of forearm
pronation.

on the location of the lesion
• Sensory loss: Usually none. If present, it will only be on the dorsal
aspect of the digits 4 and 5.

Radial mononeuropathy
Posterior interosseous
• Weakness: Finger extension, relative sparing of wrist extension. Thumb
abduction may be mildly weak because the posterior interosseous
nerve supplies the abductor pollicis longus.

and triceps reflexes will be spared.
• Most common cause is trauma or compression. “Saturday Night Palsy”
• Treatment: Usually conservative, with physical therapy, wrist splinting,
and pain management

MONONEUROPATHIES

At the axilla
• Weakness: All muscles affected by radial mononeuropathy at the spiral
groove, plus the triceps
• Sensory loss: The lateral dorsum of the hand and thumb, as well as the
posterior arm and forearm

• Weakness: Hip flexion (if proximal to the inguinal ligament) and knee
extension
• Sensory loss: Anterior thigh and medial thigh, lateral leg below the
knee

Lateral femoral cutaneous mononeuropathy
• Weakness: None
• Sensory loss and paresthesias over lateral thigh
• Causes: Obesity, diabetes, compression from tight-fitting belts, postpartum women
• Treatment: Avoid compression, local anesthetic injection, topical
analgesics, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories. Neurolysis is rarely
indicated, but it can be helpful in refractory cases.

Tibial mononeuropathy (tarsal tunnel syndrome)
• Weakness: None clinically. Atrophy of intrinsic foot muscles may be
present.
• Sensory symptoms: Aching, numbness, and tingling involving the sole of
the foot, the toes, and occasionally the heel.
• True tarsal tunnel syndrome is rare, and it occurs almost uniformly
after a history of trauma to the foot.

Disorders of neuromuscular junction:
myasthenia gravis
Epidemiology
Occurs in 50–125/1,000,000. Bimodal distribution, often affecting females
in their second and third decades, and males in their sixth and seventh
decades.

Pathophysiology
• Autoimmune disease with antibodies against acetylcholine receptor,
results in dnicotinic ACh receptors at NMJ
• End-plate potentials (EPPs) have damplitude and do not trigger a
muscle action potential. With repeated contractions, more fibers fail to
contract, leading to fatigue.
• Thymus is abnormal in 75% of cases (15% thymoma, 85% thymic
hyperplasia).
• May be associated with other autoimmune diseases: thyroiditis, Graves
disease, RA, SLE, pernicious anemia, Addison disease, vitiligo.

DISORDERS OF NEUROMUSCULAR JUNCTION: MYASTHENIA GRAVIS

Clinical manifestations
• Fatigable weakness
• Diplopia and ptosis are the most common presenting features. In
15%–20%, the disease never progresses beyond ocular muscles.
• Bulbar weakness, limb weakness, and respiratory weakness may
occur.
• Weakness may get worse as the day goes on.
• In patients with longstanding disease, weakness may be fixed.
• No pain, sensory loss, or reflex abnormalities
• Symptoms exacerbated by
• Superimposed infection
• Surgery
• Hyperthyroidism (found in 3%)
• Drugs that affect neuromuscular transmission
• Anesthetics that cause neuromuscular blockade
• Antibiotics (aminoglycosides, quinolones, some macrolides, possibly
penicillins)
• Antihypertensives (beta blockers, verapamil)
• Anti-arrhythmic drugs (quinine, procainamide)
• Other: magnesium, phenothiazines, chloroquine, lithium, some antiepileptics, iodinated contrast agents
• Penicillamine can cause a drug-induced myasthenic syndrome in
people without autoantibodies.

Investigations
Laboratory
• Acetylcholine receptor antibodies (ARAB) present in 85% of patients
with generalized MG and 50% of patients with ocular MG.
• A subgroup of ARAB-negative patients will have antibodies to musclespecific kinase (MUSK) instead.
• Striated muscle antibody occurs in 90% of patients with MG and
thymoma, compared to 30% in all MG patients.
• Consider screening for associated autoimmune diseases with thyroid
function studies, thyroid antibodies, vitamin B12, and intrinsic and gastric
parietal cell antibodies.
Electrodiagnostic testing
• Repetitive stimulation of CMAP shows decrement at rest. After brief
exercise, the decrement repairs, and then gradually worsens over 3
minutes. Sensitivity 50%–60%, better with proximal muscles.
• Single-fiber EMG shows increased jitter and blocking (90% sensitive,
but specificity is not as high).
Edrophonium (Tensilon) test
• Edrophonium is a short-acting cholinesterase inhibitor.
• An easily testable muscle must be affected, often the deltoid, finger
extensors, or levator palpebrae. The latter is especially useful in a
neuro-ophthalmology office, where degree of ptosis can be quantified.

113

114

CHAPTER 4

Disorders of the peripheral nervous system

• Prepare two syringes. One has 1 mL of saline, and one has 10 mg of
edrophonium in a 1 mL solution.
• Inject the saline first and observe for 1 minute, looking for
improvement in strength.
• Inject 2 mg of the edrophonium. If no improvement after 1 minute,
inject the remaining 8 mg. If no improvement after 1 minute, the test is
negative.
• Atropine (0.4 mg, repeat every 3–10 minutes as needed) can be
used to counteract side effects, including asystole, bradycardia,
nausea, excessive salivation and lacrimation, increasing weakness and
fasciculations.
CT of the thorax with contrast is essential to look for thymic enlargement
suspicious for thymoma.

Differential diagnosis
Generalized MG
• Lambert–Eaton syndrome
• Botulism
• Drug-induced myasthenia (penicillamine)
• Congenital myasthenic syndromes (defects in neuromuscular
transmission that are not caused by autoimmune disease)
• Inflammatory myopathies
• Motor neuron disease (especially bulbar onset)
Ocular MG
• Thyroid ophthalmopathy
• Mitochondrial disease (progressive external ophthalmoplegia)
• Intracranial lesion (cavernous sinus)
• Wernicke encephalopathy
• Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy

Management (See Fig. 4.4.)
Pyridostigmine
• Good first-line agent
• A cholinesterase inhibitor
• Acts within 1 hour with duration about 4 hours
• Starting dose 30–60 mg bid-tid. Titrate to effect (often up to 60 mg five
times a day). Higher doses can be used but side effects may be limiting.
• Side effects: GI upset, diarrhea, excessive salivation, fasciculations
• Overdose can cause cholinergic crisis, with increased bulbar and
respiratory weakness.
• Side effects can be treated with decreasing the dose, or adding
glycopyrrolate 1 mg qd to bid.
Prednisone
• Good second-line agent if pyridostigmine is inadequate.
• Note that about half of patients will initially worsen 7–21 days after
steroids are started.
• Start with 10 mg on alternate days, increased every 2 or 3 days to
1–1.5 mg/kg on alternate days.

• Improvement begins after 2–4 weeks with maximal benefit at 6 to 12
months.
• After 3 months or when remission is evident, the dose is slowly
tapered to the minimum dose required. Often a small dose is required
to prevent relapse.
• All patients should be treated for osteoporosis with calcium, vitamin D,
and a bisphosphonate.
Other immunosuppressants
• Used when steroids are insufficient or contraindicated, or when steroid
side effects are dose limiting. Response may take 3–12 months.
• Follow CBC and LFT every week for 2 months and then every 3
months after that.
• Azathioprine
• Thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) level may predict risk of
hematologic side effects.
• Dose: 50 mg/day for 1 week increasing by 50 mg/week to a goal
dose of 2.5 mg/kg/day
• Side effects: Hypersensitivity reaction, bone marrow suppression,
hepatotoxicity

115

116

CHAPTER 4

Disorders of the peripheral nervous system

• Cyclosporine
• Dosages of 2–5 mg/kg/day in two divided doses
• Side effects: nephrotoxicity, hypertension
• Monitor trough drug levels
• Cyclophosphamide
• Reserved for severe cases
• Oral or intravenous
• Etanercept, rituximab, tacrolimus, and methotrexate have all been
reported to be effective.
• Mycophenolate mofetil at 1000 mg bid is commonly used, but it was
not shown to be superior to placebo in a 9-month trial.
Plasma exchange
• Indications:
• Useful in myasthenic crisis with bulbar weakness and respiratory
compromise
• May also be used to reduce perioperative morbidity from
thymectomy
• Rarely, as maintenance therapy when other modalities have failed
• Five to six exchanges over 2 weeks, 2–4 L per exchange.
• Improvement usually noted within days, lasting 1–12 weeks.
• Side effects
• Bleeding from removal of circulating clotting factors
• Hypotension and bradycardia
• Transient electrolyte disturbances
• Side effects related to need for vascular access (line infections, local
thrombosis, vascular perforation)
IV immunoglobulin
• Indications and time course for benefit similar to plasma exchange
• Dose: 400 mg/kg/day for 5 days (total: 2 g/kg)
• If used for maintenance, 1 g/kg q2–4 weeks.
• Side effects
• Common: headaches, nausea, flu-like symptoms
• Serious: Renal failure, anaphylaxis, risk of hypercoagulability
Thymectomy
• Indications
• Thymoma
• Therapeutic benefit
— No good trials, but consensus is that it is helpful in patients
under 45 with AChR antibodies
— More effective in generalized MG than ocular MG
— Benefits may not be evident for months or years after surgery.
Can be curative in a fraction of patients
• Mortality is low in the hands of experienced surgeons
• Consider pre-operative plasma exchange to reduce the risk of MG
exacerbation immediately following surgery.

LAMBERT-EATON MYASTHENIC SYNDROME

Women and MG
MG and pregnancy
• Therapy
• Pyridostigmine and plasma exchange are probably safest.
• There is a low risk of fetal malformations with prednisone.
• Azathioprine and mycophenolate are teratogenic.
• In patients with eclampsia, magnesium sulfate should be avoided if
possible.
• Exacerbations during and after pregnancy are common.
• Neonatal MG
• Fourteen percent of babies born to mothers with MG develop
neonatal MG due to placental transfer of maternal antibodies.
• Weakness may be apparent days after birth and last for days or
months. Treat supportively.

Lambert-Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome
Pathophysiology
• Sixty percent are paraneoplastic, usually associated with small cell lung
cancer. Usually, the discovery of LEMS predates the discovery of cancer.
• Forty percent are autoimmune (usually in younger, female patients).
• Both have voltage-gated calcium channel antibody.

Clinical manifestations
•
•
•
•

Proximal > distal weakness, often worse in the lower extremities
Weakness may improve with sustained exercise.
Reflexes are diffusely low or absent, but may appear after exercise.
Cranial nerve involvement in about 30% (diplopia, ptosis, dysarthria,
dysphagia)
• Autonomic dysfunction (dry mouth, blurred vision, constipation,
erectile dysfunction)

Investigations
• On nerve conduction studies, there will be reduced CMAP amplitudes
that facilitate >200% with rapid repetitive stimulation (>30 Hz) or after
brief intense exercise.
• There may be a decrement on slow (2 Hz) repetitive stimulation.
• Single-fiber EMG may show increased jitter.
• Laboratory
• P/Q voltage-gated calcium channel antibodies
• SOX1 antibodies (50% sensitivity in patients with paraneoplastic LEMS)
• Chest CT or MRI to look for occult tumor. If negative, repeat at regular
intervals for 5 years or until tumor is discovered.

117

118

CHAPTER 4

Disorders of the peripheral nervous system

Management
• Treat underlying tumor, if present.
• Pyridostigmine
• Same doses as for MG
• Usually only partially effective
• Diaminopyridine
• Blocks potassium channels and prolongs action potentials
• Dose varies: 5 mg tid to 25 mg qid
• Side effects: perioral or digital paresthesias, seizures, insomnia
• An orphan drug in the United States, but it is available on a
compassionate-use basis.
• Guanidine
• 5 mg/kg to 30 mg/kg
• Side effects: Myelosuppression, renal tubular acidosis, liver failure,
cardiac arrhythmias
• Plasma exchange
• IV Immunoglobulin

Botulism
Pathophysiology
• Botulism is poisoning by a toxin produced by clostridium botulinum.
• Most commonly comes from inadequately sterilized canned or
prepared foods.
• Adult botulism is caused by ingestion of toxin; infantile botulism is
caused by ingestion of live bacteria (i.e., in honey).

Clinical manifestations
•
•
•
•
•
•

Occur 6–48 hours after ingestion
Difficulty with convergence, ptosis, paralysis of extraocular muscles
Dilated, poorly reactive pupils, other autonomic dysfunction
Jaw weakness, dysarthria, dysphagia
Spreads to trunk and limbs
Rare cardiac or respiratory involvement

Investigations

repetitive stimulation, mimicking LEMS
• Laboratory: Serum analysis for toxin by bioassay in mice. (Contact
CDC for laboratory locations.)

Management
• Monitor respiration closely, mechanical ventilation if indicated
• Equine serum trivalent botulism antitoxin. Contact State Health
Department or CDC
• Do not wait for positive toxin assay if clinical suspicion is high.
• Side effects: anaphylaxis (3%), serum sickness (20%)

motor units
Muscle biopsy
• In patients a chief complaint of myalgias, normal CK levels, and a
normal neurological examination, a muscle biopsy will only diagnose a
specific myopathy in 2%.
• Muscle selection
• A muscle that is clinically affected, but not end-stage. MRC grade 4
is ideal.
• Select a muscle that has not been the site of an IM injection or
EMG study within the last 3 months.
• The choice between needle biopsy and open biopsy depends on
experience and availability.
• Some of the muscle tissue obtained should be frozen for histological,
histochemical, and immunohistochemical investigations. The latter
technique can be used to diagnose enzyme disorders, storage
disorders, and various dystrophinopathies and sarcoglycanopathies.
• Tissue should also be fixed in glutaraldehyde for electron microscopy.
Useful for diagnosis of mitochondrial myopathies and IBM.
• Pathologic evaluation can distinguish between normal muscle (Fig 4.5)
denervation (Fig 4.6) and myopathies such as dermatomyositis (Fig 4.7)
and Duchenne muscular dystrophy (Fig 4.8)
Molecular genetic studies
• Utility
• Only common mutations can be screened.
• Confirmatory test only
• May eliminate the need for a muscle biopsy
• Muscular dystrophies
• Duchenne muscular dystrophy (dystrophin gene)
• Becker muscular dystrophy (dystrophin gene)
• Emery-Dreifuss (EMD gene encoding emerin or LMNA gene
encoding lamin A and C)
• Myotonic dystrophy 1 and 2
• FSHD (deletion in 4q)
• OPMD (PABP2 gene)
• Limb-girdle dystrophies (mutations encoding dysferlin, FKRP,
myotillin, lamin A/C, caveolin 3, calpain 3, sarcoglycans)
• Mitochondrial disorders
• Kearns-Sayre syndrome
• Chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia (CPEO)
• MELAS, MERFF, NARP
• Congenital myopathies
• Central core (RYR1 gene)
• Multicore (SEPN1 and RYR1 genes)
• Myotubular myopathy

DERMATOMYOSITIS AND POLYMYOSITIS

• Consider induction therapy with iv methylprednisolone 500 mg for
5 days.
• Oral prednisone 1 mg/kg daily
• When CK normal and clinical improvement reduce by 5 mg
alternate days over 2 months. Thereafter, dose is gradually reduced
monitoring CK and clinical state.

INHERITED MYOPATHIES

Inclusion body myositis
Clinical manifestations
• Painless weakness, progressive over months to years
• Mean age of onset is 60.
• Distribution of muscle weakness is clue to diagnosis
• Distal upper extremity weakness, especially finger and wrist flexors
• Marked quadriceps weakness, presenting as falls and difficulty going
down stairs
• Other limb muscles eventually involved
• Weakness and atrophy may be asymmetric (10%–20%).
• Mild facial weakness may occur.
• Dysarthria and dysphagia may occur at any stage of the disease.

Differential diagnosis
ALS
• Both can present with progressive painless asymmetric weakness and
dysphagia.
• IBM does not cause upper motor neuron signs.
• EMG shows neurogenic motor units in ALS, and mixed neurogenic/
myopathic motor units in IBM.
Polymyositis
• Both can present with symmetric proximal weakness, although this is
less common in IBM.
• In those situations, muscle biopsy must be used to distinguish them.

Investigations
• CK levels are normal or elevated, but always <10x the upper limit of
normal.
• EMG—positive waves, fibrillation potentials, and motor units that are
either myopathic or mixed myopathic/neurogenic.
• Muscle biopsy, showing an inflammatory infiltrate and rimmed vacuoles

Management
• Nothing is clearly effective.
• A trial of corticosteroids may be considered if marked inflammatory
cells on biopsy or very high CK, which may suggest PM is the correct
diagnosis.
• One small study showed no objective benefit with IVIG, but patients in
treatment arm reported improved quality of life.

Inherited myopathies
Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and Becker muscular
dystrophy (BMD)

CHAPTER 5

Stroke and other vascular disorders

Ischemic stroke
• Ischemic stroke is responsible for 80% of all stroke, with intracerebral
hemorrhage responsible for ~15% and subarachnoid hemorrhage
for ~5%.
• Transient ischemic attack (TIA)
• Classical definition: symptoms and signs resolve within 24 hours.
Likely outdated as MRI shows evidence of permanent infarction in
many cases of “classical” TIA.
• New tissue-based definition: proposed by American Heart
Association in 2009 defines TIA as transient episode of neurological
dysfunction caused by focal brain, spinal cord, or retinal ischemia,
without acute infarction
• Early risk of stroke after TIA is high:
• 90-day risk, 3%–17.3%
• Risk or recurrence is highest in first 48 hours, so rapid evaluation is
warranted.

Etiology
• Atherothromboembolism:
• Carotid and vertebral stenosis
• Intracranial stenosis
• Aortic arch atheroma
• Cardioembolism
• Small vessel disease (lacunar stroke), typically related to history of
hypertension or diabetes
• Arterial dissection
• Inflammatory vascular disorders:
• Giant cell arteritis
• Systemic vasculitides, e.g., SLE
• Primary angiitis
• Hematological disorders:
• Antiphospholipid syndrome
• Thrombophilic states
• Genetic disorders:
• CADASIL
• Mitochondrial disorders, e.g., MELAS
• Sickle cell disease
• Infections:
• Meningitis, e.g., TB
• HIV
• Others:
• Migraine
• Oral contraceptive, pregnancy

ISCHEMIC STROKE

Modifiable
• Hypertension (most important risk factor for both ischemic and
hemorrhagic stroke)
• Smoking
• Diabetes
• Obesity

• Amaurosis fugax/retinal infarction
• Hemiparesis
• Hemisensory loss
• Hemianopia (optic tract and radiation)
• Dysphasia
• Sensory inattention
• Visual inattention
Posterior circulation (vertebrobasilar)

capsule or in pons
• Pure sensory stroke (thalamus)
• Ataxic hemiparesis (weakness and ataxia affecting the same side) due
to a pontine or internal capsule lesion
• Clumsy hand/dysarthria due to a pontine or internal capsule lesion
• Typically due to small vessel disease from hypertension or diabetes,
though identical clinical syndrome can occur with embolic infarct or
hemorrhage

139

140

CHAPTER 5

Stroke and other vascular disorders

Investigations
Blood tests (first-line)
• CBC
• Ca2+ (hypo- or hypercalcaemia may be a cause of focal deficit)
• Electrolytes, creatine, LFT
• Glucose
• Cholesterol
• Clotting screen
Blood tests (second-line, consider in select cases)
• ESR
• Thrombophilia screen (though treatment implications are unclear):
• Protein C, S, and antithrombin III defects;
• Factor V Leiden mutation 20210GA
• Antiphospholipid antibody
• Lupus anticoagulant
• Blood cultures (endocarditis)
• Homocysteine (though not clear that vitamin supplementation reduces
recurrent stroke)
• Lactate
• Cardiac enzymes
• Thyroid function
Other investigations
• Urine analysis (diabetes, hematuria in bacterial endocarditis or
vasculitis, toxicology screen)
• ECG (AF, MI)
• Consider longer cardiac monitoring to screen for paroxysmal AF
• Surface echocardiogram or transesophageal echocardiogram.

Imaging
See next section for details.

Imaging of ischemic stroke
Brain imaging
CT scan (Figs. 5.1 and 5.2)
• CT should be performed as soon as possible especially if thrombolysis
is being considered.
• May detect other unexpected lesions, e.g., tumors
• Contrast not indicated and can be misleading
• A normal scan excludes hemorrhage but not infarct.
• Small hemorrhages lose their high density (white), become iso- then
hypodense and therefore may be indistinguishable from infarct: in small
hemorrhages by 7–10 days, larger hemorrhages 2–3 weeks.
• Small infarcts less likely to be visible than large ones. 90% of large
infarcts are visible at 48 hours compared to 40% of lacunar or small
cortical infarcts.

basal ganglia shows slight loss of gray-white distinction along the left insular lobe
and left putamen consistent with acute ischemia. (B) Axial image shows a dense
MCA sign (white arrow) consistent with acute thrombus in the vessel.

Figure 5.2 CT of evolving acute stroke. Axial CT image at the level of the basal
ganglia in the same patient obtained within 7 hours (A) and 24 hours (B) after the
onset of symptoms. Progression of low attenuation is seen within the left frontal
and insular lobes and involving the deep gray and white matter structures.

IMAGING OF ISCHEMIC STROKE

• Large infarcts may show subtle changes by 6 hours—depends on
expertise of interpretation. Between 10 days and 3 weeks infarcts
become isodense and difficult to define.
• After 2–3 months they are more visible, showing same density as CSF.
MRI (Fig. 5.3)
• May be an option for initial imaging of stroke in select centers
• Shows ischemic lesion more often than CT and therefore useful in
those with CT scan negative infarcts
• Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) shows changes within minutes.
Useful to distinguish acute from chronic changes. More sensitive but
not specific for infarction. Encephalitis, demyelinating plaques, tumors
may all show increased signal.
• DWI most useful in identifying minor cortical or lacunar strokes or, in
patients with a previous stroke and deteriorating signs, it may show the
development of a new lesion.
• True restricted diffusion is verified with corresponding dark signal
on apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps. In contrast, high signal
on the ADC maps is marker for T2 shine through (artifact) on the
diffusion images.
• Multiple infarcts in different vascular distributions suggest
cardioembolism or vasculitis.
• T2-weighted images show lesions in 90% by 24 hours.
• However, due to infarct evolution, with routine MR imaging (T2 and
T1) “fogging” also occurs and may not show lesions.
• FLAIR (fluid-attenuated inversion recovery) sequences increase
sensitivity but will reveal additional incidental lesions, making
interpretation more difficult.
• Routine MR sequences will show features for hemorrhage (low T2
signal due to hemosiderin) in 90% indefinitely.
• Gradient echo (GE) or T2* sequences are the most sensitive for
detection of hemorrhage.
• Use of mismatch between perfusion and DWI, which may identify
salvageable territory amenable to intervention, is under investigation.

Imaging of vessels
• Imaging of extracranial vessels should be performed in all patients with
TIA or mild to moderate stroke affecting carotid circulation.
• Imaging of intracranial and extracranial vessels can be considered for
all stroke patients to help define mechanism of stroke and for risk
stratification. However, specific management strategy for intracranial or
vertebrobasilar stenosis remains unclear at this time.
Doppler US is the simplest and safest method of assessing carotid and
vertebral arteries to detect stenosis or dissection. Very operator dependent, and it only images a portion of extracranial vessels.
MRA
• Good correlation between normal MRA and absence of disease
• However, MRA tends to overestimate degree of stenosis since
narrowing may be due to stenosis slow flow or turbulence.

Figure 5.3 Acute left MCA stroke on MRI. (A) DWI axial, (B) ADC map, (C) axial
FLAIR, and (D) axial T2-weighted images at corresponding levels. Large area of
hyperintense FLAIR and T2 signal region in the left frontal lobe is consistent with
branch occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery. Hyperintense diffusion signal,
which is hypointense on ADC-weighted images, confirms true restricted diffusion.
Note the contralateral right frontal acute infarction as well, which suggests a
cardioembolic source.

• Contrast-enhanced MRA gives better morphological assessment but
may not differentiate between occlusion and very slow flow (“flow
gap”).
CT angiography
• Noninvasive option, rapid image acquisition
• May be better than MRA at distinguishing occlusion from slow flow
(Fig. 5.4).

CHAPTER 5

Stroke and other vascular disorders

Digital subtraction angiography (DSA or conventional catheter angiography) is the gold standard and will identify stenosis severity including complete occlusions and almost occluded vessels. However, risk of stroke is
about 1%. Note: methods of calculation of % stenosis vary.

Arterial dissection
• Contrast-enhanced CT scan is rarely diagnostic.
• MRI with fat-suppressed T1W axials recommended as first choice
(Fig. 5.5), though CTA an option as well.
• “Fried egg appearance”—eccentrically located narrowed lumen
within an expanded artery
• Lumen may be patent (flow void), reduced flow (isointense), or
occluded/very slow flow (hyperintense).
• Surrounding crescent of intramural hematoma (hyperintense on
TW1 axials with fat suppression)
• Absence of high signal in lumen on GE (T2*) indicates occlusion.
• Doppler ultrasound may demonstrate intimal flap, a double lumen, and
intramural thrombosis.
• If MRI not diagnostic, CTA or MRA may show lesions.
• DSA remains the gold standard.

circle of Willis demonstrates signal in both lumens of the visualized extracranial
carotid artery (white arrow). The brighter intensity in both images demonstrates

Management of ischemic stroke
General management
• Admission to a stroke unit has been shown to reduce mortality by 30%
and improve outcome.
• Blood pressure: cerebral autoregulation is disturbed after stroke.
• Optimal management uncertain. Routine BP lowering is not
recommended.
• May consider treatment (goal ~15% reduction) if sustained BP
>220/120. Lower levels in the acute stage should not be treated
unless coexistent with hypertensive encephalopathy, aortic
dissection, acute MI, or LVF.
• Oxygenation: no data available but O2 should be given if saturation
<92%.
• Control of blood glucose: hyperglycemia in acute stroke associated
with poor outcome. Maintain normal levels with insulin if necessary.
• Fever should prompt a search for infectious source, and consideration
of antipyretics as hyperthermia can exacerbate brain injury.
• Intravenous fluids with isotonic saline to maintain cerebral perfusion.
• Swallowing and nutrition: if abnormal swallow arrange speech-language
pathology assessment. Consider NG tube or PEG tube feeding. Advice
from dietitian for nutritional support.

147

148

CHAPTER 5

Stroke and other vascular disorders

• Physiotherapy: early mobilization and rehabilitation to minimize physical
deterioration, restore function, and develop strategies for coping with
impairment.
• DVT prevention: avoid dehydration. Compression stockings. Consider
use of thromboprophylaxis if prolonged immobilization with SC heparin.
• Seizures occur in 2%—focal or generalized. Conventional AED for
recurrent events.
• Monitor for post-stroke depression and neuropsychiatric complications
such as emotional lability, which occurs in 50%.

Specific treatment of acute stroke
Acute ischemic stroke
• Intravenous (IV) thrombolysis:
• Intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) given
within 3 hours improved functional outcome (NINDS trial). Most
benefit obtained if given within first 90 minutes.
• ECASS-3 trial also showed a benefit to IV rtPA in the 3–4.5 hour
window; though there were slight differences in exclusion criteria
compared with the NINDS 0–3 hour trial
• Defining an accurate time of symptom onset (or “last time known
to be normal”) often requires diligent history taking.
• Thombolytic candidates must have BP <185/110 before treatment
and maintained <180/105 after thrombolytic treatment.
• Major complication is hemorrhagic transformation (occurs in ~6%
with no overall increase in mortality).
• Organized stroke systems of care should be used to facilitate rapid
evaluation and treatment of potential thrombolytic candidates
• Avoid antiplatelets and anticoagulants for 24 hours after rtPA.
Monitor patients closely after treatment for neurological
deterioration and BP.
• Intra-arterial (IA) thrombolysis
• Limited randomized trial data to support its use
• Endovascular treatment with thrombolytic agents or mechanical
clot removal devices may be an option for individuals with large
vessel occlusions (carotid, proximal MCA, or basilar).
• May be a longer time window than IV thrombolysis
• Combined IV-IA approaches are also under investigation.
• Individuals who are otherwise good candidates for IV thrombolysis
should NOT be offered IA treatment, as time to treatment is a key
factor.
• Antiplatelet drugs:
• Aspirin started within 48 hours reduces mortality and recurrent
stroke.
• CT first to exclude hemorrhage
• Anticoagulation:
• Routine anticoagulation of stroke patient is not recommended. No
evidence that early anticoagulation reduces morbidity, mortality,
or early recurrent stroke. Studies have shown that immediate
treatment with heparin reduces DVT and PE but associated with
increased risk of cerebral hemorrhage.

PREVENTION OF ISCHEMIC STROKE

• AF or other cardioembolic cause, treat with aspirin and start oral
anticoagulation after approximately 2 weeks, though no data on
safety regarding when to start anticoagulation.
• At present no data on heparin in dissection, though both
anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapy for 3–6 months are
considered treatment options for dissection.
• Surgery: hemicraniectomy may be considered in raised intracranial
pressure (malignant MCA occlusion), and it has been shown to
be beneficial in reducing mortality in clinical trials. Posterior fossa
craniectomy considered for large cerebellar infarcts.

Prevention of ischemic stroke
Primary prevention
Atheroembolism
• Avoidance and treatment of risk factors:
• Hypertension
• Diabetes
• Smoking
• Hypercholesterolemia
• The risk of stroke in patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis is
much less than in those with symptomatic stenosis—2% per annum
versus 15% in the first year.
• The Asymptomatic Carotid Atheroclerosis Study (ACAS) found a
statistically significant reduction in stroke risk after surgery for stenosis,
at least 60%.
• Benefit seen at 5 years, so patients must have 5 year expected life span
• Consider patient factors, comorbidities
Cardiac embolism
• AF: nonrheumatic AF risk of stroke is five-fold. Risk is higher if other
risk factors are present:
• Increasing age
• Hypertension
• Impaired LV function
• Valve disease
• Diabetes
• High risk: 8%–12% annual stroke risk if age >75 years, diabetes,
hypertension. Warfarin with target INR 2–3 reduces stroke risk by 60%.
If warfarin contraindicated, use aspirin.
• Low risk: 1% annual stroke risk. If age < 65 years and no other risk
factors, use aspirin.

Secondary prevention
• Lifestyle changes, e.g., smoking, weight, and alcohol reduction
• BP: Hypertension is perhaps the most important risk factor to control
post-stroke.
• PROGRESS trial showed reduction in recurrent hemorrhagic and
ischemic stroke using perindopril and indapamide even if BP normal.

149

150

CHAPTER 5

Stroke and other vascular disorders

• Antiplatelet drugs:
• Aspirin (75–300 mg) reduces the risk of recurrent stroke and
vascular death by 18%.
• Combination of aspirin + dypiridamole (200 mg) may be more
effective than aspirin alone.
• Clopidogrel (75 mg) may be slightly more effective and should be
used in those intolerant of aspirin.
• Combination of aspirin plus clopidogrel does not offer benefit
in secondary stroke prevention over single antiplatelet and is
associated with increase in bleeding complications.
• Cholesterol lowering
• Lifestyle/dietary changes
• If stroke/TIA plus coronary disease or symptomatic atheroclerosis,
use statin to goal LDL of <100 mg/dL (70 mg/dL if very high risk)
• Statins should also be used in atherosclerotic stroke/TIA, even in
individuals without coronary disease.
• Warfarin has no benefit for secondary stroke prevention for patients
in sinus rhythm.
• AF patients should be anticoagulated after stroke.
• Surgical/endovascular treatment:
• Carotid endarterectomy is highly beneficial in those with >70%
stenosis; moderately beneficial for those with 50%–69%.
• Higher risk of stroke and therefore may be a greater benefit in
those with recent symptoms, ulcerated plaque, and hemispheric
presentation rather than amaurosis fugax
• Secondary data analysis of trials indicates greater benefit if surgery
done within 2 weeks of symptom onset.
• Operative mortality, 1.1%; operative risk of stroke, 75%.
• Carotid angioplasty and stenting currently being evaluated; may be
an option for individuals at high surgical risk, thoug h optimal patient
selection remains to be defined by clinical trials.

Cerebral venous thrombosis
Epidemiology
• Incidence 0.22/100,000
• Most frequent in neonates. Women > men
• Risk factors:
• Pregnancy and puerperium
• Oral contraceptive pill
• ENT infections
• Cancer
• Prothrombotic states
• Dural AV fistulae

Clinical features
• ICP as idiopathic intracranial hypertension:
• Headache

CEREBRAL VENOUS THROMBOSIS

• Visual obscurations
• Papilledema
• VIth nerve palsy
• Focal neurological deficit:
• Hemiparesis
• Dysphasia
• Seizures
• Diffuse encephalopathy:
• Delirium
• Coma
• Seizures
• Multifocal neurological deficits
• Cavernous sinus syndrome
• III, IV, VI, V1 palsy
• Proptosis

Investigations
• Imaging (see below)
• Consider screen for prothombotic states

Management
• Treat associated infection.
• Anticoagulation with heparin followed by warfarin for 6 months.
Consider lifelong if prothrombotic conditions exist.
• If not responding or deteriorating, consider local thrombolysis therapy.
• ICP:
• Repeated LP or external lumbar drain or lumbo-peritoneal shunt
• Mannitol
• If not responding or deteriorating, consider sedation, ventilation,
and decompression craniectomy.
• Seizures: treat with appropriate antiepileptics.

Imaging in venous thrombosis
Difficult diagnosis to make clinically and radiologically.
• CT scan (Fig. 5.6) reveals:
• Local or diffuse swelling
• Hyperintense venous sinuses and cortical veins
• Parenchymal lesions—often multiple, low attenuation lesions with
edema and hemorrhage (high density). Thalami and basal ganglia
involved if internal cerebral veins thrombosed. SAH may be present.
• Contrast-enhanced CT: enhancement of dural sinuses around
nonenhancing expanded thrombus (“delta sign”)
• CT venogram demonstrates filling defects and expansion of
thrombosed sinuses.
• MRI shows (Fig. 5.7):
• Acute: absent flow void in dural sinus (isointense on T1W but
hypointense on T2W (mistaken for flow void). Subacute: sinus
hyperintense on T1W and T2W.
• Parenchymal lesions are hyperintense on T2W/FLAIR with edema ±
hemorrhage ± enhancement ± swelling local or diffuse.

154

CHAPTER 5

Stroke and other vascular disorders

• MRV shows loss of flow, or irregularity or severe narrowing indicating
thrombus.
• Some cases may require DSA for further evaluation.
• Multiple modalities may be required to make a diagnosis.
• Prominence of edema prior to and around hemorrhages suggests
venous hypertension.
• Degree of normal variation in size of lateral sinuses and cortical
veins makes interpretation difficult.

Primary angiitis of the central nervous
system (PACNS)
Clinical features
• Rare disorder
• Typically a subacute progressive encephalopathy, with headache. May
be punctuated by seizure, or stroke, though presentation with only
isolated stroke is unusual
• Can affect brain or spinal cord
• Classically progressed to severe disability or death in the preimmunosuppressive era

Differential diagnosis (partial list)
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

CNS lymphoma, intravascular lymphoma
Multiple sclerosis
Multiple cardioembolic strokes
Chronic progressive noninflammatory vasculopathy (moya moya)
Reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndromes (RCVS, see later)
Systemic inflammatory conditions (Sarcoid, Bechets, Susac, etc.)
Infectious etiologies (TB, Lyme, syphilis, Herpes zoster, fungal
meningitis)

Imaging
• Brain MRI findings are nonspecific (Fig. 5.8) with periventricular,
subcortical white matter hyperintensities with or without evidence of
cortical infarcts and hemorrhagic foci.
• Catheter angiography may be normal or may show multiple luminal
irregularities, narrowings, occlusions, and sometimes aneurysms.
Vascular narrowings are not necessarily specific for vasculitis and can
be seen in other conditions such as atherosclerosis.

Investigations
• Serum tests to screen for systemic inflammatory conditions and
associated systemic vasculitis, though systemic inflammatory markers
may be normal.
• Echocardiography to rule out cardioembolism
• CSF frequently shows elevated protein or lymphocytic pleiocytosis,
though normal CSF does not exclude PACNS.

compatible with vasculitis, which was confirmed clinically in this patient.

155

156

CHAPTER 5

Stroke and other vascular disorders

• Brain and meningeal biopsy should be performed to confirm diagnosis,
given the significant toxicities of treatment, and the potential to
discover alternative diagnoses at biopsy.
• Biopsy may also be negative given potential for patchy involvement,
which makes diagnosis particularly challenging.

Management
• First-line treatment is typically with steroids in combination with
cyclophosphamide. Must monitor for treatment complications.
• Typically treat for at least 1–2 years.

Reversible cerebral vascoconstriction syndromes (RCVS)
• Also described as Call-Fleming syndrome, benign angiopathy of the
central nervous system (BACNS), postpartum angiopathy, drug-induced
arteritis (cocaine, methamphetamine).
• Important to distinguish from PACNS, which requires long-term
aggressive immunosuppressive treatment, whereas RCVS do not.
• More common in women than men. Classic presentation is with acute
onset severe (“thunderclap”) headache, which can mimic subarachnoid
hemorrhage/aneurysm rupture. Critical to exclude SAH with CSF studies.
• May present without focal features or may have symptoms of stroke
or seizure.
• CSF should be normal or near normal in RCVS. If abnormal, consider
other etiologies.
• Brain MRI may be normal or may show areas of infarction.
• Intracranial vessel imaging with MRA, CTA, or catheter angiography
shows multifocal segmental arterial vasoconstriction. Vasoconstriction
reverses within days to weeks (typically less than 12 weeks).
• Management options include short-term course of oral steroids,
calcium channel blockers, or simply observation, since some patients
may resolve spontaneously without treatment.

Spontaneous intracerebral
hemorrhage (ICH)
• Spontaneous ICH is a common cause of morbidity.
• Twenty percent of strokes caused by cerebral hemorrhage (75% ICH
and 25% SAH).
• Risk factors for ICH are similar to those with ischemic stroke:
• Age
• Male gender
• Hypertension
• Smoking
• Diabetes
• Excessive alcohol use

SPONTANEOUS INTRACEREBRAL HEMORRHAGE (ICH)

Etiology
• Hemorrhage is due to rupture of small vessels and microaneurysms in
perforating vessels.
• Underlying vascular conditions should be considered:
• AVM
• Aneurysm
• Cavernoma
• Amyloid angiopathy
• Dural arteriovenous fistula
• Cerebral venous thrombosis
• Hemostatic factors:
• Anticoagulant drugs
• Anti-platelet drugs
• Coagulation disorders
• Thrombolytic therapy
• Other etiologies:
• Drug abuse (cocaine)
• Moya moya syndrome
• Hemorrhage into a tumor (metastatic malignant melanoma, renal,
thyroid, and lung carcinoma, choriocarcinoma, oligodendroglioma,
and ependymoma)
• Clues to the etiology may come from site:
• Basal ganglia in hypertensive bleeds
• Sylvian fissure in MCA aneurysms
• Lobar bleeds in amyloid angiopathy, though hypertension is also an
important risk for lobar bleeds.

Clinical features
• Sudden ictus as a stroke
• ± Signs and symptoms of increased ICP—severe headache and
vomiting
• Seizures and meningism

Management
• Standard medical support and rehabilitation evaluations as in ischemic
stroke
• Surgical evacuation of the hematoma depends on location, age, and
premorbid performance status of the patient. Recent STICH trial
suggests no benefit to routine early hematoma evacuation.
• Infratentorial hematomas are special cases—may warrant surgical
intervention for evacuation or shunt insertion for hydrocephalus.
• Stop anticoagulants and antiplatelet drugs.
• Sequential compression devices for DVT prophylaxis; may consider
subcutaneous heparin after 3–4 days if persistent hemiplegia and
documentation of cessation of hemorrhage.
• Correct coagulation deficits, though optimal method of correction is
unknown.
• Monitor for seizures, low threshold to consider antieplipetics,
particularly for lobar ICH

157

158

CHAPTER 5

Stroke and other vascular disorders

• Blood pressure management:
• Ongoing trials hope to address the role of acute blood pressure
lowering in ICH
• Need to balance potential risk of elevated BP contributing to
hematoma expansion with risk of cerebral hypoperfusion if BP
lowered too much
• Until trials are complete, it is probably reasonable to consider
modest (e.g., 10%–15%) BP reduction if SBP >180 or MAP >130.
Consider ICP monitoring if suspicion of elevated ICP to maintain
cerebral perfusion pressure >60–80 mmHg.

Imaging of ICH
Guidelines
Nonenhanced CT (Fig. 5.9) and then:
1. If hematoma location and history typical of hypertension, i.e., striatocapsular (65%), thalamus (20%), pons and cerebellum (10%), no further
imaging necessary.
2. If atypical history or unusual CT appearance, contrast-enhanced MRI;
T2* may give evidence of previous hemorrhagic lesions. Also consider
MRV or CT venography.
3. If there is suspicion of an underlying vascular abnormality or an
aneurysm, perform a DSA.
4. If initial investigations are unhelpful, consider repeat delayed MRI or
DSA, as the hematoma can obscure potentially relevant findings in the
acute phase.

Serial imaging features
Hyperacute (<6 hours)
• Presence of oxyhemoglobin, mass effect, and edema
• CT: isodense with low-density elements (“swirl”)
• MRI: T1W isointense, T2W hyperintense, T2* heterogeneous or
hypointense
Acute (6 hours to 3 days)
• Presence of deoxyhemoglobin, mass effect, and edema
• CT: hyperdense
• MRI: T1W isointense, T2W hypointense, T2* hypointense
Early subacute (3 days to 1 week)
• Presence of cellular methemoglobin, mass effect, and edema
• CT: hyperdense
• MRI: T1W hyperintense, T2W hypointense, T2* hypointense
Late subacute (1 week to 1 month)
• Free methemoglobin, minimal mass effect, and edema
• CT: isodense with hypodense rim
• MRI: T1W hyperintense, T2W hyperintense, T2* hypointense

IMAGING OF ICH

Figure 5.9 CT of acute hypertensive ICH. Large acute hemorrhage centered in
the right lentiform nucleus with marked surrounding mass effect, leftward midline
shift, and intraventricular extension of bleeding.
Chronic (months)
• Presence of hemosiderin. No mass effect or edema
• CT: hypodense
• MRI: T1W, T2W, and T2* hypodense
Note: Coagulopathy and severe anemia result in isodense acute hematoma
on CT. Rapidly accumulating hematomas may have fluid levels.

CHAPTER 5

Stroke and other vascular disorders

Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH)
Clinical presentation
Clinical severity varies widely.
• Headache—worst-ever headache; “hit on the back of the head.” May
occur during strenuous activity such as sexual intercourse. Associated
with vomiting
• Coma
• Sudden death
Examination may reveal:
• Typical signs of meningism (neck stiffness, photophobia, positive Kernig
sign);
• Presence of subhyaloid hemorrhages on fundoscopy
• Signs of ICP (bradycardia, hypertension);
• (Late) papilledema
See Tables 5.1–5.3 for grading systems for SAH.

Causes
•
•
•
•
•

Berry aneurysm
Trauma
Traumatic and infectious aneurysms
Clotting disorder or anticoagulant, e.g., warfarin
Dural AVM

Diagnosis
1. CT scan positive in 95% in first 24 hours. If negative proceed to:
2. LP: measure opening pressure and look for evidence of blood and/or
xanthochromia.
3. Check clotting screen.
4. If CT scan is positive or LP positive, l CT angiogram or digital
subtraction angiography (formal catheter angiogram).

Management
Cerebral vasospasm
• Focal cerebral ischemia as a result of cerebral artery vasospasm is the
biggest cause of neurological morbidity.
• Vasospasm is maximal from 5–10 days post-SAH.
Standard prevention and treatment
• Calcium antagonist nimodipine 60 mg every 4 hours has been shown
to decrease the rate of development of vasospasm-induced ischemic
deficits from over 25% to <20%.
• Hydration with normal saline
• “Triple H” therapy = hypertension (with inotropic drugs),
hemodilution, and hypervolemia and is used in established vasospasm
• Use of colloidal solutions such as albumin, dextran, or hexastarch (to
improve flow and rheology viscosity)

CHAPTER 5

Stroke and other vascular disorders

• Chemical (papaverine) or balloon angioplasties to physically open the
cerebral arteries are also used but with mixed results. Appears most
useful around the time of endovascular (coil) or neurosurgical (clip)
interventions, but the effects are probably not sustained.
Investigations
• Many centers utilize transcranial Doppler to monitor cerebral arterial
flow as a surrogate marker of vasospasm.
• Diffusion/perfusion MRI scans are also used when available to study
deficits in regional cerebral perfusion.
Securing the aneurysm to prevent rebleeding
Timing of the definitive treatment of cerebral aneurysms (coiling or clipping) will depend on:
• Patient’s general and neurological condition
• Extent of angiographically defined vasospasm
• The ethos of the neurosurgical unit as to what degree the patients are
treated “early” or “late”
• However, only in those with large ICHs secondary to middle cerebral
artery aneurysms is emergency treatment advocated.
Hydrocephalus See “Hydrocephalus,” p. 376.

Outcome and prognosis
• Angiogram-negative SAH. Following SAH, cerebral angiography is
negative in 15%–20% of cases.
• Consider delayed repeat angiogram to verify absence of aneurysm.
• Perimesencephalic SAH is angiogram negative and typically has
a benign course. Patient may have headaches for several weeks
but with no further hemorrhages. Small risk for development of
hydrocephalus
• Patients with SAH due to an aneurysm:
• Approximately one-third die, usually out of hospital.
• Approximately one-third recover completely.
• Approximately one-third recover with some disability.

Imaging of SAH
Diagnosis of SAH
• Nonenhanced CT positive in 95% within the first 24 hours. Sensitivity
decreases with time so that at 1 week <50% positive (Fig. 5.10).
Imaging features
• Blood (high density) in subarachnoid space ± intraparenchymal ±
subdural space
• Distribution of blood may indicate site of aneurysm:
• Predominant Sylvian fissure ± temporal lobe = MCA
• Symmetric distribution or marked involvement of anteroinferior
interhemispheric fissure or medial frontal lobe = ACom artery

IMAGING OF SAH

164

CHAPTER 5

Stroke and other vascular disorders

• Lateralization in suprasellar, prepontine, ambient cisterns ± tentorial
subdural component = PCom artery
• Prepontine and 4th ventricle = PIC artery
• Interhemispheric subdural = pericallosal artery
• Perimesencephalic hemorrhage, i.e., blood in prepontine,
interpeduncular, and ambient cisterns, = venous etiology
• Early communicating hydrocephalus is typical.
• Low attenuation areas may indicate ischemia from vasospasm.
MRI T1W and T2W are relatively insensitive; FLAIR is the best sequence
with hyperintensity in the subarachnoid space. Hypointense on T2*.

Differential diagnosis
•
•
•
•

Leptomeningeal infection
Inflammation
Infiltration
Propofol anesthetic

Investigation of cause of SAH
• MRA and CTA detect aneurysms >3 mm.
• Negative in 15%–20% of cases of aneurysmal SAH
• Aneurysms are multiple in 20%, and these modalities should provide
information on which is responsible as well as vasospasm.
• Phase-contrast MRA removes effect of T1 shortening of blood.
DSA remains the gold standard.
• Greater sensitivity for aneurysms <3 mm
• Largest aneurysm with irregular contour (“nipple”) will typically be
responsible for the SAH.
• DSA identifies vasospasm accurately.
• However, it is negative in 7%–10%.

Guidelines for imaging for SAH
•
•
•
•
•

If nonenhanced CT positive, then CTA or DSA
If CTA positive, then surgery or DSA + endovascular coiling
If CTA negative, then DSA
If DSA positive, then surgery or endovascular coiling
If DSA negative, this may be due to vasospasm or large hematoma.
Repeat DSA after an interval of 1 to 2 weeks
• In patients with a classic perimesencephalic pattern on CT in excellent
clinical condition and no vasospasm, a second angiogram may not be
necessary.

Saccular aneurysms
• These are well-defined extra-axial lobulated lesions that may present
as a result of an SAH or size (>2.5 cm).
• On CT, if patent, show up as hyperdense to brain tissue and enhancing
with or without intramural calcification. If thrombosed, appears as
hyperdense lesion with calcification commonly.

CEREBRAL ANEURYSMS

• MRI shows variable signal due to slow or turbulent flow. Fifty percent
have flow void. Thrombosed lesions often hyperintense on T1W and
hypotense on T2W images.
• Further investigation is with MRA or CTA or DSA.
Differential diagnosis
• Meningioma, especially in suprasellar region
• Macroadenoma/suprasellar mass (especially hyperintense on T1W)
• CP angle AICA or PICA aneurysm
• Third ventricular mass (basilar tip aneurysm)
Note: Differentiating an unruptured aneurysm from a mass, particularly if
thrombosed, can be difficult. Aneurysm should always be considered in the
differential of a mass in the classic sites.

Cerebral aneurysms
Berry aneurysms
Cerebral (berry) aneurysms are outpouchings of the vessel walls that
occur commonly on the branching points of the cerebral arteries around
the circle of Willis in the subarachnoid space.
Incidence and epidemiology
• Prevalence at least 1% in adults in the United Kingdom/United States.
Increasingly common with age and in females (2 to 1)
• Aneurysms rarely but classically occur in inherited disorders such
as polycystic kidney disease, Marfan syndrome, pseudoxanthoma
elasticum. In countries of high prevalence e.g., Japan and especially
Finland, familial aneurysms are much more common.
Neuroanatomy
Typical aneurysm sites
• Posterior communicating
• Anterior communicating (Fig. 5.11)
• Middle cerebral branch points (Fig. 5.12)
• Cerebral aneurysms are sized as small (<1 cm maximum diameter),
large (1–2.5 cm), and giant (>2.5 cm). Seventy percent of cerebral
aneurysms are small. Twenty percent of cases have multiple aneurysms.
Natural history Incidental aneurysms have a hemorrhage rate of less than
1% per annum if less than 7 mm in diameter. Larger aneurysms and patients
with multiple aneurysms or with a previous SAH have a higher bleed rate.
Risk of bleeding is higher in cigarette smokers and hypertensives.
Presentation
Cerebral aneurysms present in a variety of ways.
• SAH
• Incidentally on screening or for unrelated symptoms (e.g., headache)
• Third nerve palsy (usually painful, following rapid expansion of a
posterior communicating artery aneurysm)
• Visual failure (with large ophthalmic segment aneurysms)

CHAPTER 5

Stroke and other vascular disorders

Treatment
Neurosurgical clipping and neuroradiological coiling are current treatment
modalities (Fig. 5.13).
• Surgical clipping involves a craniotomy, microdissection of blood vessels
of the brain, and passing a titanium clip across the aneurysm neck. May
have higher chance of permanent “cure” than with coiling
• Coiling has the advantage of obviating the need for a craniotomy. A
radiologist passes a catheter endovascularly, similar to performing
an angiogram, and then delivers a number of platinum coils into the
aneurysm itself. This technique in experienced hands probably has
less procedural morbidity than neurosurgical clipping. However, there
is a higher incidence of regrowth of the aneurysm and late re-SAH.
Therefore, long-term clinical radiological follow-up is advised.
Note: Both techniques need to avoid occluding a cerebral artery or bursting the aneurysm itself. Procedural risk is thus higher in the early period
following SAH. Late treatment reduces this risk but increases the risk of
re-hemorrhage before treatment, which is highest in the first few days following the initial SAH.

Infectious cerebral aneurysms
Unusual lesions occur most often in the setting of infective endocarditis
with septic embolism. These generally occur in the anterior cerebral circulation and are often multiple.
• Pathology: due to acute pyogenic necrosis of arterial wall secondary
to vasculitis. Clinically recognized ipsilateral septic thromboembolism
precedes hemorrhage in 40% of cases.
• Bacteriology: most frequent causative organisms found in blood culture
are Staphylococcus and Streptococcus species.
• Predisposing medical conditions: congenital or acquired cardiac valvular
disease, intravenous drug use, and immunocompromised patients.
Investigations
• High degree of suspicion is required in high-risk patients who develop
neurological symptoms—CT or MRI imaging.
• Definitive investigation is four-vessel angiography. These lesions will be
found most commonly in peripheral branches of the middle cerebral
artery; angiography must cover this vascular territory.
• Not uncommon for sequential angiograms to be required to follow the
response to antimicrobial treatment if a nonsurgical treatment regimen
is instituted.
Management
• Some recommend antimicrobial therapy alone to treat infectious
aneurysms, as in up to 50% of cases such lesions resolve or decrease in
size following such treatment.
• Timing of any cardiac surgery is crucial to eliminate the infective focus
as a further cause for bacteremia and emboli.
• Surgery of infectious intracranial aneurysms is technically difficult, but it
may be necessary in selective cases if increase in size or frank abscess.

CHAPTER 5

Stroke and other vascular disorders

Excision of the lesion with the involved vessel may be required.
Neurological deficits may result.
Fungal aneurysms
• Tend to occur more proximally on the intracranial vessels and more
frequently involve the large arteries at the base of the brain
• Occur almost exclusively in immunocompromised patients
• Candida albicans and aspergillus fumigatus are the most common.
• Tend to be more indolent in nature, but their management strategies
tend to be similar, i.e., persist with antifungal chemotherapy rather than
high-risk surgical/radiological interventions unless absolutely necessary

Traumatic intracranial aneurysms
Unusual condition accounts for <1% of all intracranial aneurysms. Also
known as false or pseudo-aneurysms, which define a tear in the arterial
wall, associated with extravessel thrombus, which constitutes the aneurysm wall.
Etiologies
• Penetrating injuries such as stab wounds and gun shot wounds
• Following closed head injury: typically and classically at the distal
anterior cerebral artery territory, where an artery is torn against the
under edge of the falx cerebri. It may also occur at the skull base,
where it can cause carotico-cavernous fistulae or occlusion.
Clinical presentation is usually as a delayed cerebral hemorrhage following an otherwise unremarkable recovery from brain injury. A high index of
suspicion is required.
Treatment is with neurosurgical excision or with endovascular treatment if ruptured. Optimal treatment of unruptured pseudo-aneurysms is
unknown.

Cerebral arteriovenous
malformations (AVM)
Incidence
• Ten times less common than cerebral aneurysms
• Rarely multiple except in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia
• Congenital in origin

Pathology
They consist of tangles of pial blood vessels with characteristic early shunting of blood from arteries to veins.

Clinical presentation
• Frequently asymptomatic through life
• May present with ICH, seizures
• Unusual manifestations result from development of a vascular steal or
venous hypertension phenomenon.

CEREBRAL ARTERIOVENOUS MALFORMATIONS (AVM)

Natural history studies
Inadequate but risk of hemorrhage is between 2% and 4% per annum.
Features associated with risk are as follows:
• Intranidal aneurysms
• Venous stenosis
• Ectasia
• Old age
AVM size is not related to hemorrhagic risk.

Diagnosis
• CT. Nonenhanced scan may be normal or show an area of hyperdensity
with no mass effect. Twenty percent show calcification. With contrast,
avid enhancement and a large draining vein may be visualized.
• MRI. Mesh of flow voids, large draining veins. Slow-flow lesions may
enhance (Fig. 5.14).
• DSA (Fig. 5.15). Defines nidus size and architecture accurately. Identifies
feeding arteries, the presence of deep or superficial cortical draining
veins, flow rate (important for endovascular planning), intranidal
aneurysms (in >50%), venous stenosis

Management
• Decisions are critically dependent on angiographic findings of size,
shape, position, presence of intra- or extranidal aneurysms, patient age,
symptoms, and prior hemorrhage.
• AVMs are relatively benign in the medium term and bleeding risk is
probably not altered by partial treatment.
• Symptomatic treatment, e.g., anticonvulsants, and regular follow-up, is
an initial option.
• Aim of intervention is complete obliteration. Three treatment options
may be used alone or in combination:
Neurosurgery
• Offers the chance of a cure at one operation but is difficult with a
significant morbidity
• Larger lesions cause normal pressure perfusion breakthrough.
• Surgical risk can be graded with the Spetzler–Martin grading system
between 1 and 5:
• 1, 2, or 3 points depending on size (<3 cm, 3–6 cm, >6 cm)
• 1 point if deep venous drainage
• 1 point if eloquent cortex
• Pre-operative embolization reduces vascularity.
• Significant incidence of residual AVM following surgery
• Small peripheral AVMs with recent hemorrhage ideal surgical targets
Neuroradiological embolization
• The goal is to occlude nidal vessels with either NBCA glue or onyx
(liquid embolic agents).
• Only 10%–25% can be obliterated completely.

• Useful adjunct to surgery or radiosurgery
• Complications due to catheter sticking to fragile vessels, extravasation
of glue, infarction, or hemorrhage
Radiosurgery
• High-dose radiotherapy focused on the lesion using a stereotactic
frame and delivered in one treatment session
• Gamma knife or Linac-based systems are used to deliver the radiation.
• Advantages: low morbidity, day case procedure
• However, obliteration occurs gradually over 2 years by progressive
endarteritis obliterans. During this period the risk of hemorrhage is not
reduced.
• Most suited for lesions <3 cm

173

174

CHAPTER 5

Stroke and other vascular disorders

Cavernous hemangioma (cavernoma) and
developmental venous anomaly (DVA)
Cavernomas
• Vascular lesions consisting of large vascular channels with slow blood
flow within
• Capillary lesions macroscopically resemble blackberries.
• May be located within the brain or spinal cord or cauda equina
• Familial cases reported, more likely to have multiple cavernomas if familial
• May result from trauma or radiation
• Solitary, 75%; multiple, 25%
• May enlarge
Clinical presentation
• Hemorrhage <1% per annum
• Epilepsy due to epileptogenic hemosiderin leaching out
• Progressive neurological deficits, especially in the posterior fossa and in
the spinal cord
Imaging features
• CT: normal in 50%. Well-defined hyperdense lesion with no edema
unless acute hemorrhage. Occasional calcification and may or may not
enhance (Fig. 5.16)
• MRI (Fig. 5.17): rounded or oval lesion with rim of hypointensity (T1W
and T2W) results from hemosiderin due to chronic bleeding. Internal
heterogeneous signal on T1W and T2W represents blood products
of various ages. T2* hypointense (black) lesion is the most sensitive
sequence for detection.
• DSA usually negative
Management
• Accessible lesions can be excised if recurrent hemorrhage.
• Radiosurgery as a treatment option is still controversial.

Developmental venous anomaly (DVA)
• Represent anomalous venous drainage pathways
• Enlarged white matter, often periventricular; veins radiate around a
central vein
• May be associated with cavernomas and cortical dysplasia
• Usually asymptomatic lesions found incidentally on CT/MRI
Clinical presentation Rarely hemorrhage except when associated with
other vascular lesions.
Imaging features
• CT and MRI: small linear or stellate enhancing lesions with no mass
effect (Fig. 5.18).
• DSA venous phase reveals a “Medusa head.”
Management
• Previously excised with poor outcomes, as they functionally drain
normal brain tissue
• Now considered benign normal variant and left alone

CAVERNOUS HEMANGIOMA AND DVA

Dural arteriovenous fistulae (dAVF)
Cranial dAVF
These occur throughout the neuroaxis. Common sites include anterior
fossa floor, adjacent to the major venous sinuses, and the tentorial hiatus.
Clinical features
Presentation is with the following:
• Hemorrhagic stroke
• Progressive neurological deficit due to venous congestion
• Headaches
• Pulsatile tinnitus especially if a bruit is audible
• Seizures
Imaging
• CT/MRI is usually normal unless there is venous occlusion.
• DSA after hematoma resolution, if acute presentation, defines the
location, feeding arteries, and venous drainage.

177

178

CHAPTER 5

Stroke and other vascular disorders

Grading system according to Djinjian and Merland
• Group 1. Blood drains directly into meningeal vein or sinus. Normal
direction of flow
• Group 2. Venous reflux into cortical veins
• Groups 3 and 4. Venous reflux is associated with retrograde flow along
the venous sinuses.
Group 1 lesions are benign and rarely require treatment to prevent
hemorrhage. Other groups are at risk of hemorrhage and likely warrant
intervention.
Treatment
• Requires multidisciplinary assessment with neurosurgeon and
interventional neuroradiologist.
• Options include occlusion of abnormal fistulous communication
between artery and vein by surgery or endovascular techniques using
glue occlusion.

Carotid cavernous fistula (CCF)
Subtype of dAVF. Defined as low flow or high flow, traumatic or spontaneous, direct or indirect, aneurysmal or nonaneurysmal.
Clinical features
• Sudden onset, painful, pulsatile exophthalmos and ophthalmoplegia
• Cavernous sinus acts as a barrier and intracranial or subarachnoid
hemorrhage does not occur.
• High-flow fistulae occur in young males following trauma or a ruptured
aneurysm. Result in a direct communication between internal carotid
artery and cavernous sinus.
• Low-flow or indirect fistulae occur in older patients with vascular risk
factors. Result from dural fistulae within the walls of the cavernous
sinus from branches of the internal or external carotid arteries.
Management
• High-flow fistulae rarely close spontaneously. Closure is with
endovascularly released detachable balloons or coils.
• Low-flow fistulae tend to obliterate spontaneously. Conservative
management by intermittent massage to occlude the internal carotid
artery in the neck. Occasionally, partial embolization of external
carotid branches but not internal carotid due to risk of stroke.

Spinal dAVF
• Most common spinal vascular malformation (80%)
• May be acquired secondary to thrombosis of the extradural venous plexus
• Venous hypertension and engorgement result in a subacute necrotizing
myelopathy.
Clinical features
• Presents in middle to late age group with a progressive myelopathy
(Foix–Alajouanine syndrome)
• Commonly between T5 and L3
• Spinal bruit may be heard.

DURAL ARTERIOVENOUS FISTULAE (DAVF)

• Diagnosis should be considered in any patient with a cauda equina lesion
with a mixture of upper and lower neuron signs + sphincter involvement.
Imaging features
• MRI may be normal or show nonspecific abnormalities with intramedullary hyperintensity on T2W and hypointensity on T1W.
• Typically involves the conus and lumbar enlargement
• Specific features are the dilated pial veins along the dorsal surface of
the cord best seen on T2W images as serpiginous foci of flow void
against hyperintense CSF. However, it may be difficult to differentiate
from CSF pulsatile flow.
• Gadolinium may reveal serpiginous areas of enhancement.
• MRA with contrast may demonstrate enlarged intradural veins.
• Spinal angiography is gold standard for diagnosis, localization, and
treatment.
Management
• Endovascular obliteration using liquid embolic agents such as
N-butylcyanoacrylate (NBCA) in >50% of cases
• Can be performed at the time of spinal angiography
• Open surgical intervention to divide the fistulous point under a surgical
microscope

CHAPTER 6

Epilepsy

Epilepsy: introduction
Epilepsy is defined as an increased tendency to have recurrent seizures,
manifested by two or more unprovoked events. The etiology of epilepsy
may be known (symptomatic epilepsy) or unknown (idiopathic epilepsy).
Isolated seizures occurring in the context of an acute illness (e.g., hypoglycemia) should not be considered epilepsy.

Incidence and prevalence
May be estimated at 50/100,000/year; in the United States, the prevalence of
epilepsy is estimated at 5–8/1000 (1.5–2 million people affected). A higher
incidence and prevalence of epilepsy has been observed in developing
countries.

Etiology
The cause of epilepsy remains unknown in nearly 70% of cases. Etiology
varies significantly with age. In the United States, epidemiologic studies
have estimated the frequency of the following known etiologies:
• Cerebrovascular disease, 13.2%
• Developmental, 5.5%
• Cerebral trauma, 4.1%
• Derebral tumor, 3.6%
• Infection, 2.6%
• Neurodegenerative, 1.8%
Other important causes include hippocampal sclerosis, and cortical and
vascular malformations. In the tropics, neurocysticercosis is a common
cause.

Classification
Epilepsies are often classified as electroclinical syndromes with a principal
distinction made between generalized and focal (partial) onset seizures.
Epilepsy may be classified etiologically as follows:
• Idiopathic (possible genetic predisposition with normal development,
neurological examination and neuroimaging studies)
• Symptomatic (structural abnormality present on imaging studies)
• Cryptogenic (structural abnormality suspected but not demonstrated)

Classification of epilepsy (modified, abbreviated
classification of the International League against Epilepsy)
Generalized epilepsies and syndromes
• Idiopathic with age-related onset:
• Childhood/juvenile absence epilepsy
• Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME)
• Epilepsy with generalized tonic–clonic seizures (GTCs) on
awakening
• Symptomatic and cryptogenic:
• West syndrome
• Lennox–Gastaut syndrome
• Epilepsy with myoclonic absences

EPILEPSY: INTRODUCTION

• Symptomatic
• Myoclonic encephalopathy
Focal epilepsies and syndromes
• Idiopathic with age-related onset:
• Benign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes
• Reading epilepsy
• Symptomatic:
• Epilepsy with simple partial, complex partial, or secondarily
generalized seizures arising from any part of the cortex
• Epilepsia partialis continua (EPC)
• Syndromes characterized by specific activation
Undetermined epilepsies and syndromes (focal or generalized)
Epilepsy with continuous spike and wave activity in sleep.

Clinical features
Seizures are paroxysmal, stereotypic events. Diagnosis is clinical; eyewitness accounts are crucial. Seizures usually last only several minutes, but
they may be followed by a more prolonged interval of transient drowsiness, confusion, or focal deficits. (See “Loss of consciousness,” p. 53.)
Triggers include:
• Alcohol
• Fatigue
• Sleep deprivation
• Infections and fever
• Hormonal fluctuations
• Hypoglycemia
• Stress
• Strobe lighting (photosensitive epilepsy)
• Reading, hot water (rare)
Childhood absences
• Rare after age 10 years
• F>M
• Brief loss of awareness (several seconds) many times a day. Triggered
by hyperventilation
• Most cases remit in adulthood.
• EEG characteristic—3 Hz spike and wave, no photosensitivity
Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME)
• Onset before age 30 years
• Myoclonic jerks in the morning
• Typical absences
• Generalized tonic–clonic seizures
• EEG typical with 3–4 Hz generalized spike/wave or polyspike/wave ±
photosensitivity
• Remission rare; lifelong pharmacologic treatment usually indicated

183

184

CHAPTER 6

Epilepsy

Complex partial seizures
• Often associated with underlying structural abnormality, e.g.,
hippocampal sclerosis (Fig. 6.1), dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumor
(DNET; Fig. 6.2), cavernous hemangioma, or cortical dysplasia (Fig. 6.3).
• Automatisms (lip smacking, chewing, swallowing, stereotypical hand
movements)
• Déjà vu and jamais vu
• Olfactory or gustatory auras (unpleasant)
• Unusual behavior or emotionality

MANAGEMENT OF EPILEPSY

Investigations
• Blood investigations:
• CBC
• Renal, liver function, calcium, magnesium, glucose
• MRI with specific (coronal) views of both temporal lobes if complex
partial seizures
• EEG; consider sleep deprived and prolonged ambulatory recordings if a
routine study is negative.

Management of epilepsy
General advice
• Advise the patient not to drive. The seizure-free interval needed for
resumption of driving privileges varies according to state legislation.
In “mandatory reporting” states the physician must report the event
directly to the state attorney-general. In other states, this responsibility
is incumbent upon the patient.
• Avoid unsafe activities, i.e., take showers rather than baths, avoid
swimming alone, do not use power equipment or work at heights.

Starting treatment
Single seizures
No treatment is indicated unless the EEG or MRI reveals an abnormality
that suggests a high risk of recurrence. If precipitating factors (e.g., sleep
deprivation, alcohol) are identified, avoidance or abstinence should be
recommended.
After a single unprovoked seizure, the risk of recurrence is 24% with no
focal neurologic abnormality and a normal EEG, and 65% if associated with
focal findings on examination or MRI, and an abnormal EEG.
Prophylaxis
There is no indication for starting treatment in patients with head injuries,
craniotomy, and brain tumors, unless seizures actually occur.

Drug treatment (see Tables 6.1 and 6.2)
Aim of treatment is to render the patient seizure free with minimal side
effects. Other complications include sudden unexpected death in epilepsy
(SUDEP)—1/200/year in refractory epilepsy.
• Factors to be taken into account when choosing treatment:
• Age
• Sex
• Type of epilepsy
• Other drugs, e.g., oral contraceptives (OCPs)
• Other medical conditions, e.g., liver or renal dysfunction
• Therapy is initiated at a low dose gradually titrating to an effective level
to avoid side effects (“start low, go slow”).

*Assess CBC, electrolytes, and LFTs when initiating treatment and at 6–12 month intervals
during therapy.

• If seizures continue, increase dose as tolerated. If seizures persist,
transition to another first-line drug.
• If anticonvulsant monotherapy is unsuccessful, adjunctive treatment
with a second-line drug should be considered.
Drug monitoring
Measuring drug levels is indicated in the following situations:
• Suspected poor or erratic compliance
• Symptoms of toxicity, e.g., nausea, ataxia, confusion, diplopia
• There is little correlation between blood levels and therapeutic effect
for many newer anticonvulsants (e.g., lamotrigine, oxcarbazepine,
topiramate, levetiracetam), so routine therapeutic monitoring of blood
levels is unhelpful.
Prognosis with drug treatment
By 12 months 60%–70% of treated patients will be seizure free. After 2
years, withdrawal of drugs can be considered. Predictive factors for relapse
include the following:
• Syndromic epilepsy, e.g., JME
• Underlying structural pathology
• Continued epileptiform abnormality on EEG
• Severe prolonged epilepsy before remission
• Increased age
Factors that may affect the decision to stop include driving. Patients
are advised to stop driving during drug withdrawal and for 6 months
thereafter.

189

CHAPTER 6

Epilepsy

Resective surgery
Any patient with focal epilepsy who has failed two or more trials of anticonvulsant therapy should undergo inpatient video/EEG monitoring and
other evaluations (high-resolution MRI, neuropsychological testing, and
sometimes further neuroimaging studies (e.g., ictal SPECT, FDG-PET; see
Fig. 6.2) in order to determine whether they are candidates for resective
surgery.
Patients with certain structural neuroimaging findings (e.g., mesial temporal sclerosis; Fig. 6.1), DNET (Fig. 6.2), or cavernous hemangioma may
have a high (up to 80%) probability of seizure remission following surgery.
Resective procedures are most commonly performed on the temporal
lobes. In the nondominant hemisphere, an anteromesial resection including
the anterior temporal neocortex, amygdala, and hippocampus may be performed (Fig. 6.4). In the dominant hemisphere, more selective resections
of the mesial temporal structures are often performed to spare language
function.
In the absence of structural brain pathology, implantation of intracranial
electrodes (Fig. 6.5) may be required to delineate ictal onset and permit
functional mapping studies.

Vagus nerve stimulation
In patients with medically refractory epilepsy who are not good candidates for surgical resection, vagus nerve stimulator (VNS) therapy may be
considered. The vagus nerve stimulator is an implantable medical device
consisting of a battery and generator unit, which is usually implanted subcutaneously under the left clavicle, with two wire leads that are tunneled
under the skin of the neck. A second incision allows attachment of the
terminals of these leads to the vagus nerve trunk. Once implanted, the
device is programmed externally to deliver regular stimulation to the
nerve, and it may be activated by the patient using a magnet. Although
complete remissions are unusual, many patients with severe inoperable
focal and generalized epilepsy experience significant improvement, with
minimal surgical risks at the time of implantation and few adverse effects
apart from transient hoarseness during activation.

WOMEN AND EPILEPSY

Women and epilepsy
Contraception
• Anticonvulsants that induce hepatic enzymes (carbamazepine,
oxcarbazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone, and topiramate)
all reduce estrogen/progesterone levels and increase the risk of OCP
failure. Valproic acid and levetiracetam do not appreciably alter serum
estrogen/progesterone.
• Reduced OCP efficacy may be addressed by high estrogen (at least
50 µg) preparations, conversion to depo provera, or another method
of contraception.
• OCPs induce the metabolism of lamotrigine, potentially indicating an
increase in dosage.

Fertility
• Women with epilepsy have lower fertility rates due to multiple factors,
e.g., sexual dysfunction in those with TLE.
• Valproic acid is associated with polycystic ovarian syndrome.

Pregnancy
• Preconception counseling is essential.
• There is a 4%–6% probability of fetal malformation with anti-epileptic
drugs (AEDs) taken in the first trimester; highest risk with valproic acid
and anticonvulsant polytherapy.
• Every effort should be made, where possible, to use anticonvulsant
monotherapy at the lowest effective dose.
• Folic acid (4 mg/day) should be taken by all women of childbearing age
who are on anticonvulsant therapy, in order to minimize risk of fetal
malformation.
• Patients who become pregnant on AEDs should have increased
obstetrical surveillance (ultrasound, alpha fetoprotein levels) for fetal
malformation.
Epilepsy during pregnancy
• Thirty percent of women will experience significant improvement
in their epilepsy during pregnancy, with some patients becoming
transiently seizure free. Thirty percent of patients will have increased
seizure frequency during pregnancy, with the most exacerbation seen
in the late first and early second trimesters.
• Clearance of hepatically metabolized AEDs (phenytoin, carbamazepine,
valproic acid, lamotrigine, topiramate) is increased during pregnancy,
sometimes necessitating dosage increases. Free (unbound) levels of
highly protein-bound drugs (phenytoin, carbamazepine, valproate)
should be measured due to increased volume of distribution. Clearance
of renally eliminated drugs (levetiracetam) is also often increased.
Following delivery, readjustment of AED dosages is often needed.
• New onset seizures during pregnancy demand investigation. Potential
serious etiologies include:
• Eclampsia
• Neoplasms, especially meningioma

193

194

CHAPTER 6

Epilepsy

• Subarachnoid hemorrhage
• Arteriovenous malformation
• Arterial/venous thrombosis
Patients taking enzyme inducing AEDs (phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital) during pregnancy should be treated with vitamin K, 20 mg/day
beginning in the 36th week of pregnancy to prevent hemorrhagic disease
of the newborn.
The risks of breast feeding during AED therapy remain unknown for
most agents. The exceptions are phenobarbital, primidone, and benzodiazepines, which are present in high concentrations in breast milk and which
can produce significant neonatal lethargy and irritability. In all instances, the
potential benefits of breast feeding (bonding between mother and infant,
transfer of passive immunity) must be weighed against the potential risks
of nursing with maternal anticonvulsants.

Psychogenic seizures
Often referred to as “nonepileptic seizures” or “pseudoseizures,” these
events are often confused with epilepsy, usually to the detriment of the
patient. Individuals with psychogenic seizures frequently undergo unnecessary therapy with anticonvulsant drugs with the attendant short-term
and long-term adverse events, and they are also occasionally intubated
and monitored in the intensive care unit (“pseudostatus”). This problem
is complicated by the fact that 50% of patients with psychogenic seizures
may have epilepsy as well.
Clinical features of psychogenic seizures
• May be found in 10%–30% of patients referred to tertiary care centers
for evaluation of refractory epilepsy
• History of childhood physical and/or sexual abuse.
• Triggered by stress
• Not responsive to multiple trials of AEDs
• Frequent admissions to hospital
• Certain characteristics of the attacks may suggest the diagnosis
(Table 6.3), although inpatient video EEG monitoring is usually definitive.
Management
• Establish diagnosis with certainty.
• Explain that the attacks are an unconscious response to some form of
stress.
• Relaxation techniques and cognitive-behavioral therapy are the most
appropriate treatments, although other psychiatric comorbidity
(e.g., depression) often has to be addressed.
• Response to therapy is optimal when the history of psychogenic
attacks is relatively brief.
• Consider gradual withdrawal of AEDs if there is low suspicion of
coexistent epilepsy.

Status epilepticus
Status epilepticus occurs in the United States at a rate of 50 per 100,000
persons per year. It is defined as consecutive seizures without complete
interictal recovery, or as a single prolonged seizure lasting longer than 5
minutes. It is a neurological emergency with an overall mortality of over 20%.

Clinical presentations
Approximately 80% of cases present as generalized tonic clonic status
epilepticus. Other subtypes are important; complex partial status epilepticus and absence status epilepticus may present as prolonged confusional
states.

195

196

CHAPTER 6

Epilepsy

Twelve percent of cases of status epilepticus are new presentations of
epilepsy in patients with no prior history of seizures.
Generalized tonic clonic status epilepticus exhibits two stages of evolution: a prodromal phase, in which discrete seizures occur with increasing
frequency and duration; and a second phase, in which clinical seizure activity becomes less conspicuous despite continuous electrographic seizure
activity (electromechanical dissociation).

Management of prodromal phase
• Maintenance of airway, oxygenation, and blood pressure. Consider
intubation for airway protection.
• Establish IV access.
• Obtain blood for CBC, serum glucose, electrolytes, toxicology screen,
and AED levels.
• Monitor vital signs closely.
• If serum glucose is not immediately available, administer 100 mg IV
thiamine, followed by 50 mL of D50 IV.
• Administer 0.1 mg/kg of lorazepam IV to a maximum of 8 mg or
0.2 mg/kg of diazepam IV (may be repeated once after 5 minutes).

Management of established generalized tonic/clonic status
epilepticus
• Administer 20 mg/kg phenytoin equivalent of fosphenytoin; deliver
no more rapidly than 150 mg/min; monitor EKG and blood pressure
throughout the infusion.
• If overt convulsive activity is no longer present, begin continuous EEG
monitoring, if available.
• When status continues beyond first IV fosphenytoin infusion,
administer additional doses of fosphenytoin at 5 mg to a total
maximum dose of 30 mg/kg.
• If status persists, intubate patient and initiate mechanical ventilation if
this has not already been done.
• Administer 20 mg/kg of phenobarbital IV at 100 mg/min.
• Consider investigations to reveal etiology of status epilepticus:
• CT scan or MRI
• CSF examination
• Reinstate any withdrawn AED.

Management of refractory status epilepticus
• The patient should by now be intubated, mechanically ventilated,
and transferred to an intensive care environment where invasive
hemodynamic monitoring can be instituted.
• Administer midazolam at a loading dose of 0.2 mg/kg, followed by a
maintenance dose of 0.75–10 µg/kg/min. Alternatively, propofol can
be given at a loading dose of 1–2 mg/kg IV, followed by a maintenance
infusion of 2–10 mg/kg/hr. In both instances, the dosage of anesthetic
agent should be titrated to a burst suppression pattern on the EEG
if the agent is well tolerated hemodynamically, or to suppression
of electrographic seizure activity if hemodynamic instability is
encountered.

STATUS EPILEPTICUS

• Anesthesia may be cautiously withdrawn after an interval of 12–24 hr;
if seizures recur, further 12–24-hour intervals should be administered
until remission is obtained.
• Treat medical complications (infection, acidosis, electrolyte
derangements, uremia, hypoglycemia) aggressively, as they will tend to
make status epilepticus highly resistant to treatment.

CHAPTER 7

Migraine

Migraine: introduction and
clinical features
Epidemiology
• Migraine is a common episodic neurological condition. It occurs in up
to 11% of the adult population, usually with onset in late adolescence
or the early third decade. Approximately 70% of migraine sufferers are
females.
• There is a tendency for migraine to become less severe or even remit
in the fifth and sixth decades.
• Forty-six percent of patients have a family history of migraine. The risk
of a child developing migraine is about 70% if both parents are affected,
and 45% when one parent is affected.

Pathophysiology
Migraine is most accurately thought of as a primary disorder of the brain
produced by dysfunctional brainstem regulation of craniovascular afferents.
In a genetically predisposed individual, activation of the trigeminovascular
network in the dorsal midbrain and dorsolateral pons presumably causes:
(a) impaired regional blood flow to the brain, (b) perimengeal vasodilatation and neurogenic inflammation, and (c) cortical spreading depression,
thought to be responsible for the migraine aura. The importance of genetics is underscored by the discovery of a mutation on chromosome 19 that
codes for a subunit of the voltage-gated calcium channel in familial hemiplegic migraine, an unusual migraine variant. It has been hypothesized (but
not proven) that other forms of migraine may be channelopathies as well.

Clinical features
• A migraine attack can be divided into four components: prodrome,
aura, headache, and resolution.
• The occurrence of an aura distinguishes two major types of migraine
episode: Migraine with aura (“classic migraine”) and Migraine without
aura (“common migraine”).
• Attacks may last from 4 to 72 hours and are recurrent, supporting the
concept of migraine as a chronic episodic disorder.
• Prodromal symptoms may include somnolence, heightened alertness,
anxiety or hunger.
Migraine aura
• The aura is variable in presentation, but most often is characterized by
visual phenomena such as fortification spectra, scotomata, scintillating
scotomata, as well as visual or auditory hallucinations. Less commonly,
visual distortions such as macropsia and micropsia may be described.
Somatosensory phenomena, usually paresthesias, are also commonly
encountered. Hemiparesis, sometimes with a “march,” olfactory and
gustatory hallucinations, and distortions of body image are unusual but
sometimes reported.
• The aura may occur without evolution into a headache; this is referred
to as “migraine equivalent.”

MIGRAINE: INTRODUCTION AND CLINICAL FEATURES

Headache phase
• Headache may be unilateral, bilateral, or shift sides during the course
of an attack. It is often throbbing in character, although it may be more
continuous and felt in a periorbital or retroorbital distribution. There is
often a “referred tension” component, with occipital and cervical pain
being prominent.
• Most important associated features include exacerbation by routine
physical activity, nausea, vomiting, photophobia, and phonophobia.
Migraine triggers
• Stress and relaxation after stress
• Sleep: sleep deprivation, “sleeping in,” interruption of usual sleep
pattern
• Trauma and mild closed head injury
• Sensory stimulation: glare, flickering lights, smells (e.g., certain
perfumes)
• Irregular eating habits: missing a meal (hypoglycemia)
• Foods: red wine, cheese, chocolate, caffeine
• Food additives: monosodium glutamate
• Exercise
• Excessive heat and dehydration
• Drugs: vasodilators such as nitroglycerin
• Changes in barometric pressure such as those preceding a
thunderstorm

Migraine variants
Basilar migraine: Usually characterized by a visual prodrome, followed by
ataxia, vertigo, diplopia, tinnitus, and nausea/vomiting. Objectively, nystagmus,
dysarthria and altered level of consciousness may be present. Sometimes
may present as an acute confusional episode, often in children.
Hemiplegic migraine: Usually begins in childhood and remits in adulthood;
may be sporadic or familial. Hemiplegia may last less than 1 hour, or it can
persist for days to weeks. Attacks are often precipitated by minor head
injury, and changes in consciousness may be present. Many cases of familial
hemiplegic migraine have been mapped to chromosome 19p13 (see earlier
section, “Pathophysiology”).
Status migrainosus: Attacks of migraine lasting longer than 72 hours, usually with prolonged nausea and vomiting.
Ophthalmoplegic migraine: Migrainous headache with 3rd or 6th nerve
paresis, which may persist for days to weeks, sometimes requiring exclusion of intracranial hypertension or aneurysm.

Other disorders presenting as migraine
CADASIL (Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy); mapped to chromosome 19
MELAS (Mitochondrial encephalopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke-like
episodes)

CHAPTER 7

Migraine

Migraine: differential diagnosis,
investigations, and International
Headache Society (IHS) criteria
Differential diagnosis
• Acute headache occurs in 15% of patients with TIA, 25% with acute
ischemic stroke, 50% with acute intracerebral hemorrhage.
• Clinical differentiation of migraine headache from other, potentially
malignant causes of headache is essential.
• Most patients presenting with initial onset of severe headache not
clinically typical of migraine, or with focal neurological symptoms or
signs will require further investigation, including neuroimaging studies
and possibly lumbar puncture.
• Patients with established migraine developing headache departing in
character from previous attacks also may need investigation.
• Other causes of headache with focal neurological disturbance:
• SAH
• Cerebral infarction, hemorrhage, venous thrombosis
• Dissection of the carotid and vertebral arteries
• Neoplasm, abscess
• Meningoencephalitis (a mild lymphocytic pleocytosis may be seen
during an acute migraine attack)

Investigations
Imaging studies detect a significant abnormality in <0.5% patients with
migraine and a normal neurological examination, and are not usually indicated. MRI scans in migraine patients, with and without auras, may reveal
small nonspecific white matter lesions in 30% of individuals under the age
of 40 years. Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) and magnetic resonance venography (MRV) are useful in identifying acute arterial occlusion,
aneurysm, and venous sinus thrombosis.

CHAPTER 7

Migraine

Migraine therapy
Choice of therapy is governed by frequency and severity of attacks, associated symptoms, responses to prior treatment, coexistent disorders, and
adverse events.

Acute (abortive) migraine therapy
Simple analgesia with antiemetics
Useful only if nausea and vomiting are not major symptoms during a
migraine attack; effect may be limited by reduced gastric motility.
Acetaminophen, 500–1000 mg or an NSAID (ibuprofen, naproxen,
diclofenac) + metoclopramide, 10 mg.
Triptans (selective 5-HT1 antagonists)
• All drugs of this class (sumatriptan, zolmitriptan, naratriptan, rizatriptan,
eletriptan, almotriptan, frovatriptan; see Table 7.1) have a high efficacy
with up to 70% having a response within 2 hours and 40% being pain
free at 2 hours.
• Zolmitriptan and rizatriptan are available as wafers but do not have a
more rapid onset of therapeutic effect.
• Sumatriptan is available as nasal spray and injection.
• Early therapy will optimize therapeutic response.
• Headache recurrence within 12–24 hours occurs in 30% of patients;
a second dose of triptan may be attempted. If this is ineffective,
administration of a “rescue medication” such as a narcotic analgesic,
NSAID, corticosteroid, or neuroleptic may be considered (Table 7.2).
• If two trials of a particular triptan at high therapeutic doses are
unsuccessful, a trial of another triptan should be considered.
• Overuse may result in rebound headaches in 10% of patients.
• Contraindications include coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular
disease, uncontrolled hypertension, peripheral vascular disease,
significant hepatic impairment, and pregnancy.
• Common adverse effects include chest discomfort or heaviness; jaw,
shoulder, and neck tightness; paraesthesias, fatigue, and dizziness.
• Concurrent MAOI administration is contraindicated. Serotonin
syndrome is an occasional adverse event.
Ergotamine preparations
• Ergotamine tartrate is still sometimes useful in patients who do not
respond to triptans and who do not have any contraindications to
treatment with vasoactive medications. A dosage of 1–2 mg alone or in
combination with caffeine may be given orally at onset. It may also be
administered by inhaler or suppository.
• Overdosage results in nausea, rebound headache, and peripheral
vasoconstriction. The recommended maximum dose per week is 10 mg.
• Dihydroergotamine (DHE) is used intravenously in patients with
intractable migraine or status migrainosus at doses of 0.3–1.0 mg every
8 hours up to a total dose of 10 mg.

CHAPTER 7

Migraine

Migraine prophylaxis
• Prophylactic therapy should be considered if more than two attacks
per month are reported, or if attacks become markedly debilitating.
• A headache diary is useful to monitor frequency and patterns, including
relationship to menses, sleep patterns, and other triggers. It is critical
to determine if analgesic or triptan overuse is ongoing; these problems
will render prophylaxis ineffective.
• Prophylactic drug therapy includes (see Table 7.3):
• Beta-blockers
• Tricyclic antidepressants
• Anticonvulsants
• Calcium channel antagonists (less effective than other prophylactic
regimens but useful when other agents are contraindicated)

Migraine and women
Menstrual migraine
• Sixty percent of women report an increase in migraine frequency
around menstruation; 14% have migraine exclusively related to the
menstrual period.
• IHS criteria identify menstrual migraine as attacks without aura,
occurring on days –2 to +3 of the cycle in two-thirds of cycles.
• The hormonal stimulus is thought to be exposure to high estrogen
levels, followed by the sharp decline in estrogen immediately
prior to ovulation. Estrogen may increase the sensitivity of some
5-HT receptors. Release of uterine prostaglandins at the time of
menstruation may also play a role in the development of migraine.
Management of menstruation-related migraine
• Acute (abortive) therapy of attacks is identical to abortive therapy
of acute nonmenstrual migraine (Tables 7.1 and 7.2). Because of the
episodic and relatively predictable occurrence of these headaches in
many patients, perimenstrual prophylaxis is often recommended.

207

208

CHAPTER 7

Migraine

Nonhormonal prophylaxis
• NSAIDS:
• Naproxen 550 mg daily beginning 2 days prior to predicted
menstruation and continuing for 3 days into period.
• Triptans:
• Frovatriptan 2.5 mg bid for 6 days starting 2 days prior to
anticipated onset of menstruation.
• Naratriptan 1 mg bid for 6 days, starting 2 days prior to onset of
menses.
Hormonal prophylaxis
• Continuous hormone treatment has been recommended by many
experts in place of 21/7 day regimens because of the tendency
of estrogen withdrawal after several weeks to provoke relapse.
Unfortunately, there are presently no clinical trials or guidelines
documenting the safety or efficacy of this approach.
• The most common agent used for hormonal prophylaxis is
perimenstrual estrogen, given as estradiol gel at a dose of 1.5 mg,
or transermal estrogen 100 µg, to be given 3 days prior to onset of
menses and then continued for 1 week.
• Combination oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) may also be given; if a
1-week hormone-free interval after a 3-week cycle is consistently
associated with recurrent headache, three consecutive hormonal cycles
can be attempted, followed by 1 week of hormone withdrawal.

Migraine, contraception, and stroke
• Migraine can worsen, improve, or remain unchanged when patients are
prescribed the OCP.
• Migraine may begin de novo when a woman starts OCPs. It is not
essential to stop the pill at the first migraine attack, since headaches
may improve over a number of cycles. OCPs should, however, be
stopped if a new headache type develops, or if a new onset migraine
aura is encountered. They should also be stopped if typical headaches
become unusually intense and/or prolonged.
• The risk of ischemic stroke in young women under age 45 years rises
from 5–10 per 100,000 to 17–19 per 100,000 in migraineurs. The risk
is further elevated in patients who have migraine with aura. OCPs are
contraindicated in patients having migraine with aura, and in individuals
having migraine and other independent risk factors for ischemic stroke
(hyperlipidemia, hypertension, prothrombotic states, smoking, and right
to left cardiac shunts).

Migraine, the menopause, and hormone replacement
therapy (HRT)
• At menopause, migraine improves in 65%, worsens in 10%, and is
unchanged in 25% of afflicted patients.
• Migraine worsens in most patients subjected to surgical menopause,
suggesting estrogen withdrawal exacerbates migraine.
• Hormone replacement therapy, when indicated for menopausal
symptoms, may either improve or exacerbate migraine.

PRIMARY SHORT-LASTING HEADACHES

• Exacerbation of migraine with HRT may be relieved by reducing the
dosage of estrogen, changing to a continuous regimen in patients
developing symptoms during the withdrawal phase, or eliminating
progesterone, although this will mandate surveillance for endometrial
carcinoma.

Migraine and pregnancy
• Eighty percent of patients with migraine experience a reduction in
attack frequency during pregnancy.
• Migraine without aura patients may experience auras for the first
time in pregnancy; if this occurs, or if there is a change in attack
characteristics, it is prudent to evaluate the patient for the possibilities
of venous sinus thrombosis, arteriovenous malformation, or incipient
eclampsia.
Management of migraine in pregnancy
Nonpharmacologic management
• Avoid pregnancy-related nausea and vomiting resulting in hypoglycemia
and dehydration.
• Eat small, frequent carbohydrate snacks
• Maintain adequate fluid intake and regular sleep patterns
• Acupuncture and relaxation techniques may be helpful.
Pharmacologic management
• Prophylactic drugs should be discontinued in women planning to
conceive.
• Acute treatment:
• Acetaminophen: safe in all trimesters and during lactation
• ASA should be avoided due to risk of hemorrhage, premature
closure of ductus arteriosus, and Reye syndrome if used during
lactation. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents should be avoided
for similar reasons, and ergotamine preparations are specifically
contraindicated in pregnancy. 5-HT1 antagonists (triptans) have not
yet been demonstrated to be safe in pregnancy.
• The safest abortive therapy during pregnancy is probably a
low-dose narcotic analgesic in combination with an antiemetic;
prochlorperazine appears to be relatively safe and effective.

Primary short-lasting headaches
Paroxysmal hemicrania
• Rare disorder with a female/male ratio of 7:1; manifested by severe
unilateral headache with nasal congestion, lacrimation, ptosis, and
eyelid edema. Episodes average 13 minutes in duration and may occur
10–20 times a day. They may be precipitated by head movement, as
well as rotation of the head or neck flexion.
• Important differential diagnosis for cluster headache; chronic
paroxysmal hemicrania occurs much less frequently and attacks are
shorter and more frequent.

209

210

CHAPTER 7

Migraine

• Patients prefer to sit quietly, behavior that is rare in cluster headache.
• The diagnosis may be supported by a rapid and dramatic response to
indomethacin at an initial dose of 25 mg tid; this may be increased to
a maximum of 75 mg tid as needed. A proton pump inhibitor may be
required to control GI side effects.
• Imaging studies and other investigations are mandated to exclude
causes of symptomatic illness such as frontal lobe tumors, idiopathic
intracranial hypertension, and collagen vascular disease.

Cluster headache
Epidemiology
Prevalence is lower than for migraine, with an incidence of 0.01%, and
higher frequency in Caucasian males. The male to female ratio is approximately 2.1:1. Onset is usually seen in the late twenties, with only 10% of
cases developing in the seventh decade. It is rare in childhood. There is not
usually a family history of the disorder.
Clinical features
• Episodic cluster: The most common cluster variant; periods lasting 7
days to 1 year separated by pain-free remissions lasting 1–12 months.
• Chronic cluster: Unusual; attacks lasting more than 1 year without
remission or remission lasting less than 4 weeks.
Headache features
• Excruciatingly severe unilateral orbital, supraorbital, temporal pain
lasting 15 minutes–3 hours but usually 45–90 minutes.
• Attacks begin and end abruptly, have a tendency to occur at the same
time of day, and may awaken the patient from sleep.
• Frequency may range from one every other day to eight per day.
• Associated autonomic features are conspicuous and include
lacrimation, nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, facial/forehead sweating,
miosis, ptosis, eyelid edema, and conjunctival injection. Concomitant
gastrointestinal symptoms are unusual.
• Restlessness or agitation may occur during the headache, in contrast to
paroxysmal hemicrania.
• A minority of patients have typical migrainous auras.
• The most common precipitants are alcohol, nitroglycerin, and exercise.
Differential diagnosis
• Causes such as tumors need exclusion by MRI; occasionally secondary
cluster headache is seen in association with lesions of the cavernous
sinus.
• Features helpful in differentiating cluster headache from migraine
include the following:
• Relatively short headache duration
• Rapid onset and cessation
• Periodicity (daily and annually)
• Alcohol precipitates attack within 1 hour rather than hours as in
migraine.

TRIGEMINAL NEURALGIA

• Paroxysmal hemicrania is similar but more common in females, with
briefer and more frequent attacks. It is exquisitely responsive to
indomethacin.
• Other differential diagnoses include temporal arteritis, Tolosa-Hunt
syndrome, sinusitis, and glaucoma.
Management
• Acute attacks
• Abortive medication often unsuccessful because of acuity and short
duration of attacks.
• Subcutaneous sumatriptan 6 mg has a rapid effect and a high
response rate. This may be used twice daily. Alternatives include
sumatriptan 20 mg intranasally and zolmitriptan 5 mg orally.
• 100% oxygen, 7–12 L/min should be used for 20 minutes via a nonrebreathing mask.
• Topical lidocaine (20–60 mg) as a 4%–6% solution instilled
intranasally may be a useful adjunct.
Preventive treatments
• Prophylactic therapy may include calcium channel blockers, valproic
acid, topirimate, melatonin, corticosteroids, lithium, and capsaicin (Table
7.4). Methysergide may be useful in patients with clusters lasting a few
weeks. Start at 1 mg/day, increasing the dose by 1 mg every 3 days to a
tid regimen, with further dosage increases every 5 days to a maxiumum
of 4 mg tid. Prolonged treatment is associated with retroperitoneal,
cardiac, and pleural fibrosis. Therefore, a drug holiday for 1 month is
required every 6 months.
• Ergotamine 1–2 mg po or rectally can be taken 1 hour prior to an
attack or at bedtime if they occur predictably. Concomitant use of
sumatriptan is contraindicated.
Nonmedical therapy
• If medical therapy fails, unilateral chronic cluster may be treated with
ablation of the sensory input of the ipsilateral trigeminal nerve and
autonomic pathways, with an overall success rate of approximately
75%. Gamma knife radiosurgery and deep brain (hypothalamic)
stimulation are other surgical modalities that are under study.

Trigeminal neuralgia
This disorder is manifested by abrupt severe and repetitive lancinating pain
within one or more divisions of the trigeminal nerve (most often the first
and second divisions).

Epidemiology
• Annual prevalence is approximately 6/100,000; females are more often
afflicted than males, and onset tends to be later in life, with onset in
the sixth or seventh decade in >50% of cases.

CHAPTER 7

Migraine

Clinical features
• The neurological examination including facial sensation is normal,
although frequent successive attacks may produce lingering pain.
During some attacks, facial contortion may be seen: “tic doloreux”
• There tends to be a refractory period after an attack.
• Triggers include cutaneous sensory stimuli such as light touch, shaving,
eating, talking, and drafts of cold air.
• Attacks during sleep are rare.
• Secondary weight loss, dehydration, and depression may occur.
• Secondary causes include the following:
• Neoplasms of the 5th root entry zone such as schwannomas,
meningiomas, and epidermoid cysts
• Syringomyelia
• Basilar ectasia/impression
• Malignant/inflammatory infiltration of the skull base
• Multiple sclerosis, particularly in younger patients with bilateral
symptoms
A significant proportion of “idiopathic” cases are due to arterial or venous
compression of the posterior 5th nerve root.

Differential diagnosis
•
•
•
•
•

Temporomandibular joint disorder (TMJ) dysfunction
Atypical migraine
Atypical facial pain
Pterygopalatine neuralgia
Trigeminal autonomic cephalgias, e.g., cluster headche

Investigation
• MRI of the brain is usually indicated to exclude secondary causes. In
younger patients it is particularly important to consider MS; 2%–8%
of patients presenting with trigeminal neuralgia are also thought to
have MS.

Management
Drug treatment
Medications should be initiated at low daily dosages and gradually titrated
upward to clinical effect; see Table 7.4.
• Occasionally, combinations of drugs (e.g., baclofen and carbamazepine)
may be used at lower dosages to avoid side effects associated with high
doses of single agents
• In crises, consider intravenous phenytoin (as fosphenytoin 250 mg).
Surgical treatment
In cases refractory to medical therapy or those in whom there are intolerable side effects, surgical options (Table 7.5) need to be considered.

Idiopathic intracranial
hypertension (IIH)
IIH is a syndrome of increased intracranial pressure without evidence
of hydrocephalus or mass lesion. The composition of the CSF remains
normal. This entity has previously been referred to as benign intracranial
hypertension (BIH) or pseudotumor cerebri.

Epidemiology
• Occurs at a frequency of 1 case/100,000/year in the general population.
• There is a marked female preponderance.
• Age range: 15–44 years.

213

214

CHAPTER 7

Migraine

• Major risk factors:
• Female sex
• Obesity
• Recent weight gain
• Hypertension
• Menstrual irregularity
• In any patient without risk factors, special care should be taken to
exclude intracranial hypertension secondary to other causes.

Pathophysiology
The pathophysiology is not well understood. Possible mechanisms include
the following:
• Obstruction to CSF outflow at the level of the arachnoid villi or in
the draining veins, with some recent neuroimaging studies suggesting
partial venous outflow obstructions in patients with IIH
• Excess CSF production
• Cerebral edema of unknown cause

Clinical presentation
Usual symptoms reflect increased ICP or papilledema:
• Daily headache (throbbing) associated with nausea and vomiting
• Visual symptoms: transient visual obscurations lasting a few seconds,
visual blurring, and/or visual field loss
• No localizing neurological signs except uni- or bilateral VI nerve palsies
causing diplopia
• Cases are reported with 3rd and 4th nerve palsies, internuclear
ophthalmoplegia, and skew deviation. There are very atypical and other
causes such as venous sinus thrombosis need to be excluded.
• Papilledema may occasionally be unilateral.
• Papilledema may be absent in patients with optic atrophy.
• Central visual loss occurring early should raise concern about some
other cause of optic disc edema such as optic neuritis or anterior
ischemic optic neuropathy.
• Central visual loss may occur in IIH if severe disc edema is associated
with retinal edema, hemorhages, exudates, or choroidal folds in the
papillomacular bundle or the macula.
Diagnosis of papilledema may be difficult. Clues that an apparently swollen
disc is not due to papilledema:
• Blind spot is not enlarged
• Spontaneous venous pulsation may be present or venous pulsation will
appear on minimal orbital pressure
• The absence of an optic cup in a mild to moderately swollen disc
• Abnormal vessels at the disc
An ophthalmological consultation will be helpful in cases where the diagnosis of papilledema is challenging.

IDIOPATHIC INTRACRANIAL HYPERTENSION (IIH)

Conditions that may produce intracranial hypertension and
mimic IIH
Medical disorders
• Addison disease
• Hypoparathyroidism.
• Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
• Right heart failure with pulmonary hypertension
• Sleep apnea
• Renal failure
• Severe iron deficiency
Medications
• Tetracyclines
• Vitamin A and related compounds
• Anabolic steroids
• Withdrawal of corticosteroids
• Growth hormone administration
• Nalidixic acid
• Lithium
• Norplant levonorgestrel implant system
Obstruction to venous drainage
• Cerebral venous thrombosis
• Jugular vein thrombosis

Imaging studies
• MRI and MR venography should be performed to exclude
hydrocephalus, mass lesions, or meningeal infiltration. Isodense tumors
and subdural collections may be missed by CT. MR venography will
detect most venous sinus obstructions. If MRI is unavailable or not
possible because of the patient’s size, a CT with contrast should be
performed.
• Radiographic signs of raised intracranial pressure in IIH include
flattening of the posterior globe (80%) and an empty sella (70%).
Slit-like ventricles are not a sign of IIH.

Lumbar puncture
• The lumbar puncture (LP) is done with the patient in the lateral
decubitus position.
• Obesity may make it difficult to perform LPs on this group of patients.
LPs can be done under fluoroscopic guidance, although the radiologist
needs to be informed that an opening pressure is required with the
patient positioned accordingly. Normal CSF pressure is less than 200
mm of water. The pressure increases with increasing weight.
• To diagnose IIH, CSF pressure >250 mm water. Levels between 200 and
250 mm CSF are nondiagnostic and need to be repeated. Occasionally,
a transducer monitor via a lumbar drain may be needed to clarify the
diagnosis.

215

216

CHAPTER 7

Migraine

Management
No evidence of visual loss
Conservative management with:
• Weight loss
• Diuretics: Acetazolamide is the drug of choice as it reduces the rate
of CSF production by the choroid plexus. The starting dose is 125
mg bid, increasing to 250 mg tid, and then as tolerated to 250 mg
qid. Limiting side effects can include paresthesias, altered taste, and
depression. Furosemide can sometimes be used as an alternative.
Headache can be treated symptomatically with amitriptyline.
• Close follow-up is required with assessment of visual acuity, visual
fields (automated or Goldmann), initially at 1 month, then every 3
months. Subsequent follow-up is dependent on the clinical course.
Evidence of visual loss
Surgical intervention needs to be considered. The options are as follows:
• Ventriculoperitoneal shunting. Side effects include infection, shunt
obstruction, and low-pressure headache.
• Optic nerve sheath fenestration
• There are no data comparing the efficacy or morbidity of these two
procedures.
Repeated LP
• May be unpleasant for the patient
• Can result in low-pressure headache, which complicates the clinical
picture
• Helpful in some patients with severe headache and also in
the management of IIH in pregnancy when acetazolamide and
nortryptylline are relatively contraindicated.

Low-pressure headache
Epidemiology and causes
This disorder is most commonly the result of lumbar puncture, craniotomy,
CSF shunt placement, or trauma. Occasionally it is the product of a spontaneous dural tear, and it can also be seen in the setting of dehydration,
uremia, meningitis, or hypertonic saline administration. The true overall
incidence of this condition is unknown; the risk of post-lumbar puncture
headache is highest in younger, female patients.

Clinical features
• Onset following lumbar puncture varies from 15 minutes to 12 days.
If untreated, the headache most commonly lasts 4 to 8 days and then
resolves, although it may persist for months.

LOW-PRESSURE HEADACHE

• Low-pressure headache is worst with the patient standing erect
and consistently relieved by lying down. It may be exacerbated by
movement of the head, coughing, and straining. Dizziness, nausea,
vomiting, and tinnitus are associated symptoms, which tend to
correlate with the severity of the headache.
• Neurological examination is usually unremarkable, although mild neck
stiffness may be elicited.

Investigation
• Further investigation is usually unnecessary if the cause is known
(i.e., recent lumbar puncture or shunt placement).
• If the cause is not apparent, a CT or MRI should be performed
prior to lumbar puncture and cisternography. The MRI often reveals
diffuse pachymeningeal enhancement, diminished ventricular size, and
sometimes subdural collections and descent of the cerebellar tonsils.
• The CSF opening pressure may vary from 0 to 70 mmH2O, although it
is sometimes normal if the patient has been lying down prior to the LP.
• Radioisotope cisternography is used to identify occult CSF leaks, often
the product of mild spinal or cranial nerve root avulsion.

Treatment
• Noninvasive therapy is often effective, and it includes oral or
intravenous caffeine therapy, followed by a brief trial of corticosteroids
if the headache is refractory.
• If noninvasive therapy is unsuccessful, placement of an epidural blood
patch should be attempted. Recurrences can be treated with repeat
blood patch placement or epidural saline infusion.

CHAPTER 8

Dementias

Dementia: introduction
Dementia is defined as a syndrome of progressive impairment—in the
absence of delirium—in two or more areas of cognition sufficient to interfere with work, social function, or relationships. The areas of cognition
included in the definition are as follows:
• Memory
• Language
• Abstract thinking
• Praxis
• Visuospatial or perceptual skills
• Personality
• Social behavior

Epidemiology
At 60 years of age, 1% of the population is affected; 40% of those >85 years.
High levels of education may be protective against early cognitive decline
in setting of typical pathology but not against development of pathology
itself.

Etiology
Common
• Alzheimer disease (60%–80%)
• Dementia with Lewy bodies/Parkinson disease with dementia
(10%–20%)
• Frontotemporal dementia (5%–10%)
• Cerebrovascular disease (10%–20%)
Rarer causes
• Corticobasal degeneration
• CJD
• CADASIL (cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical
infarcts and leukoencephalopathy)
Treatable causes (<1% of dementias)
• Depressive pseudodementia
• Normal pressure hydrocephalus
• B12 deficiency
• Hypothyroidism
• Infection, e.g., syphilis, HIV
• Benign tumors, e.g., subfrontal meningioma
• Subdural hematoma
• Subclinical seizures impacting memory, attention, and concentration
• Sleep disorders (e.g., obstructive sleep apnea) leading to
pseudodementia

ALZHEIMER DISEASE (AD)

Investigations
First line
• CBC-PD
• Comprehensive metabolic panel
• Thyroid studies (TSH and free T4)
• B12
• CT or (preferred) MRI
• Dementia screening examination such as mini-mental status
examination (MMSE; see Appendix).
Second line (directed by clinical suspicion)
• ESR
• CSF examination
• HIV, RPR, VDRL
• ANA
• Lab screening for inherited metabolic deficiencies
• Formal neuropsychological assessment
• Genetic testing
• EEG
• PSG
• Volumetric MRI
• SPECT
• Brain biopsy

Alzheimer disease (AD)
Epidemiology
• Incidence: 1.2 per 1000 person years among 65–69-years olds,
increasing to 53.5 in those >90 years.
• Prevalence 4.4% in those >65 years
• Affects females more than males
• Most common >65 years
• Sporadic (common) and familial (rare) forms—no specific features to
distinguish sporadic from familial apart from early onset

Pathology
Deposits of amyloid protein in cortex with neuritic plaques (Fig. 8.1).
Neurofibrillary tangles contain tau and ubiquitin proteins. In cases of amyloid angiopathy, amyloid is found in vessel walls.

221

222

CHAPTER 8

Dementias

Figure 8.1 Temporal lobe pathology from patient with AD. Neurofibrillary tangles
(black arrow) represent degenerating neurons with abnormal tau and ubiquitin
deposition. Amyloid plaques (black arrowhead) represent sites of extracellular
amyloid deposition and often contain dystrophic neurites. Mature plaques have a
dense core and surrounding “halo.” (Photo courtesy of Mila Blaivas, University of
Michigan Pathology Department.)

Genetics
Familial cases (<5% of AD) tend to present at a younger age. Familial autosomal dominant cases associated with mutations in three known genes:
• APP gene (amyloid precursor protein) on chromosome 21
• Presenilin 1 (~50% of early-onset AD) on chromosome 14
• Presenilin 2 on chromosome 1
Other familial cases without characterized mutations as yet.

Risk factors
• Increasing age
• Apolipoprotein E ∈4 allele
• Having 1 ∈4 allele confers risk and having 2 ∈4 alleles confers even
greater risk.
• About 50% of subjects in the sporadic AD population have an ∈4
mutation.
• History of AD in one or two first-degree relatives
• Head injury with loss of consciousness >30 minutes

ALZHEIMER DISEASE (AD)

Clinical features
• Memory impairment. Episodic (personal experiences) and semantic
(store of conceptual and factual knowledge) are affected. Complaints
of forgetting day-to-day events, learning new information. Impairment
for recent past > distant past.
• Visuospatial impairment, e.g., getting lost when driving
• Constructional and dressing apraxia
• Language impairment, e.g., word-finding difficulties. Alexia, agraphia,
acalculia
• Mini-mental state examination (MMSE). A practical screening
examination. See Appendix
• Physical signs:
• Mild akinetic rigid syndrome
• Myoclonus

Investigations
• EEG: mild slowing in moderate disease; nonspecific
• MRI to exclude treatable causes, e.g., hydrocephalus. See Figure 8.2.
• Hippocampal volume measurements show correlation with histology.
Can be used to monitor disease progression:
• Bilateral hippocampal/entorhinal cortex volume loss
disproportionate to atrophy
• Volume loss with posteroanterior gradient
• Small-vessel white matter hyperintensities on T2W common
• SPECT: bilateral temporal/parietal perfusion/metabolism defects

Management
• Multidisciplinary team with nurse, counselor, and psychiatrist.
• Ten to fifteen percent risk per year of progression to AD. Treatment
with acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChI) provides mild symptomatic
benefit but does not modify disease progression rate.
• AChI and memantine (NMDA receptor antagonist) may improve
cognition and neuropsychiatric symptoms for up to several years.
Response is variable on an individual basis. If no benefit from one drug,
switch. Stop if MMSE <12; however, restart if significant worsening of
behaviors/abilities on discontinuation
• Donepezil, 5–10 mg daily
• Rivastigmine, 1.5–6 mg bid
• Galantamine, 4–12 mg bid
• Memantine, 5–10 mg bid
• Behavioral and psychiatric disorders are common. Consider (initial
doses):
• Quetiapine, 25 mg daily
• Olanzapine, 2.5 mg daily
• Risperidone, 0.5 mg daily

volume loss in the biparietal regions in a patient with clinical evidence and
concordant PET imaging of AD.

Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB)
Dementia with Lewy bodies is a combination of dementia and parkinsonism. Dementia precedes parkinsonian features by >1 year. See Box 8.1.

Epidemiology
• Usually sporadic, but familial cases occur (with younger presentation of
disease). Most commonly elderly patients (mean age of presentation:
75 years). Males outnumber females.

PARKINSON DISEASE WITH DEMENTIA (PDD)

Box 8.1 PDD vs DLB: continuum or discrete diseases?
PDD and DLB may be variant presentations of the same disease. The
symptoms and pathology are essentially the same; the definitions may
be arbitrary:
• DLB: dementia is prominent initially with mild symptoms of or later
development (>1 yr) of dopa-responsive Parkinsonism.
• PDD: Dopa-responsive parkinsonism develops at least 1 year prior
to symptoms of dementia. Incidence of dementia in a patient with PD
is 7% per year; cumulative risk of dementia by age 85 is 65%.
Alternatively, PDD and DLB may represent separate neurodegenerative
diseases
• DLB: prominent and early cortical involvement with Lewy body
pathology; rapid cognitive decline, lesser response to L-dopa
• PDD: Predictable spread of Lewy body pathology starting in
brainstem and olfactory tracts—cortical involvement a late
development; slower progression of dementia, ongoing clear
response to L-dopa.
Note: Sleep disorders, particularly REM behavior disorder (RBD) are common in both disorders
and often present many years prior to symptoms of Parkinsonism or dementia.

Pathology
• Generalized brain atrophy, depigmentation (loss of dopamineproducing cells) of substantia nigra. Lewy body inclusions in cortical
neurons. Lewy neurites are degenerating neurons that stain for alphasynuclein and ubiquitin. Forty percent of cases have amyloid deposits.
Neurofibrillary tangles are rare or absent.

Clinical features
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

L-dopa responsive parkinsonism
Cortical symptoms—aphasia, apraxia
Fluctuating mental state
Visual hallucinations and illusions
Neuroleptic sensitivity
Dysautonomia
Sleep disorders

Investigations
• MRI: generalized atrophy
• Absence of significant temporal atrophy in a demented patient
suggests DLB.

Parkinson disease with dementia (PDD)
PDD is a combination of parkinsonism and dementia. Parkinsonian features
precede onset of dementia by >1 year. See Box 8.1.

225

226

CHAPTER 8

Dementias

Epidemiology

midbrain (right).

VASCULAR DEMENTIA

Parkinsonian syndromes associated
with dementia
Patients have parkinsonian features of bradykinesia, bradyphrenia, and postural instability. They may be atypical in symmetrical presentation of symptoms, lack or tremor, or variation in posture (e.g., retroflexed neck instead
of stooped posture). The diagnostic clues are the features not seen in PD.

Progressive supranuclear palsy With gaze palsy, usually upgaze or
downgaze, corrected or improved with the oculocephalic maneuver,
retroflexed neck, backward falls, mild dementia.
Corticobasal ganglionic degeneration “Alien” limb phenomenon:
progressive clumsiness and inability to control a limb.
Multiple system atrophy Autonomic dysfunction with or without

preceding cerebellar ataxia, variable atrophy of olives, pons, or cerebellum.
Dementia is mild or absent in most patients.

Vascular dementia
Epidemiology
• Usually >40 years. Risk factors include hypertension, smoking, and
vascular disease.

Pathology
• Multiple infarcts in cortical and subcortical areas or fibrous and hyaline
degeneration of small arteries leading to white matter infarction.

Clinical features
•
•
•
•

Recurrent stepwise deterioration
Pyramidal signs
Pseudobulbar palsy
When mainly subcortical disease slowly progressive syndrome
with dysarthria, parkinsonism, gait disorder (marche á petits pas) =
subcortical arteriosclerotic dementia.

Investigations

Frontotemporal dementia
Epidemiology
• Usual onset 45–65 years
• M=F

Pathology

230

CHAPTER 8

Dementias

Bilateral atrophy of the temporal lobes is found in semantic dementia form.
Variable histopathology—cortical loss of pyramidal cells, sometimes with
inclusion of (Pick) bodies and swollen (Pick) neurons (Fig. 8.6).

Genetics
Fifty percent autosomal dominant inheritance. Some with parkinsonian
features have tau mutations on chromosome 17q21. Associated cases with
motor neuron disease link to chromosome 9.

Clinical features
Frontotemporal dementia
• Change in personality, social and personal behavior
• Apathetic, emotionally blunted
• Overactive, disinhibited
• Stereotypic movements, e.g., hand rubbing
• Perseveration
• Loss of insight
• Memory intact
Investigations
• EEG: normal
• MRI: frontal and anterior temporal lobe atrophy
Progressive nonfluent aphasia
• Pure language deficit
• Nonfluent, effortful speech
• Loss of prosody
• Repetition impaired
• Impairment of well-rehearsed series, e.g., days of the week
• Anomia
• Writing affected
• Comprehension intact
Note: Alzheimer patients may develop a similar language disorder in association with abnormalities in other domains.
Semantic dementia
• Loss of meaning of words
• Inability to recognize objects and faces
• Speech is fluent, effortless, but lacks content
• Semantic paraphasias, e.g., dog for cat
• Anomia
• Impaired comprehension
Note: May be confused with AD but memory for day-to-day events and
autobiographical details is intact.
Frontotemporal dementia with MND
Development of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis form of MND after onset
of dementia.

Other dementias
CADASIL
Clinical features
• Stroke-like episodes
• Cognitive impairment in variable cognitive domains
• Strongly associated with migraine
Investigations
• MRI: extensive white matter T2W signal change involving the temporal
lobes especially anteriorly, and the subinsular region
• Genetics: Notch 3 mutation on chromosome 19

Huntington disease
• Autosomal dominant, highly penetrant, chr. 4, huntingtin protein
(function unknown)
• Trinucleotide (CAG) repeat disorder: number of repeats correlated
with age of onset of symptoms

per year)
• No specific mutation in PrP gene; however, most individuals are
homozygous at codon 129 for methionine or valine
• Rapidly progressive dementia over weeks to months
• Myoclonus
• Atypical symptoms may include cerebellar ataxia, cortical blindness, or
amyotrophy
• 14–3-3 protein present in CSF
• EEG: periodic sharp waves

CHAPTER 9

Movement disorders and ataxia

Movement disorders: introduction
Movement disorders are broadly categorized by either an excess or a
paucity of movement—on a nonvolitional basis—into hyperkinetic and
hypokinetic movement disorders, respectively. Regardless of the genetic or
environmental influences underlying the movement disorder, the common
underlying etiology is usually an abnormality of the basal ganglia and their
connections.
The basal ganglia consist of deep nuclei with input from the cerebral
cortex through the thalamus and output to the thalamus/cerebral cortex
and pyramidal system. Within the basal ganglia are complex inhibitory and
excitatory connections allowing precise control over initiation and fine
control of movements. (See Fig. 9.1.)

PARKINSONISM AND PARKINSON DISEASE (PD): INTRODUCTION

Hypokinetic movement disorders
Hypokinetic movement disorders are characterized by rigidity and bradykinesia or akinesia. Postural instability and gait disorder may be present.
Parkinson disease is the most common hypokinetic disorder; parkinsonism
may be seen in a smaller number of other hereditary, sporadic, and acquired
disorders. Parkinson disease is the prototypical hypokinetic movement
disorder.

Parkinsonism and Parkinson disease
(PD): introduction
Causes of parkinsonism
• Idiopathic PD
• Familial (hereditary) PD
• Parkinsonian syndromes:
• PSP
• MSA
• Corticobasal degeneration (CBD)
• Secondary parkinsonism:
• Vascular
• Drug induced
• Postencephalitic
• Hydrocephalus
• Degenerative disorders with associated parkinsonism:
• Alzheimer disease (AD)
• Parkinson—dementia—motor neuron disease complex
• Genetic disorders with associated parkinsonism:
• Wilson disease (consider in all cases <50 years)
• Huntington disease (HD)(akinetic rigid [Westphal] variant)
• Dopa-responsive dystonia

Epidemiology of PD
•
•
•
•
•

Prevalence: 100–200/100,000
In United States, 1,000,000 cases at any one time
M:F ratio: 1.35:1
Uncommon in persons under 40 years
Increases in population after age 60; mean age at diagnosis 70.5 years

Etiology of PD
Idiopathic PD
• Increased risk of PD:
• Pesticides
• Exposure to manganese

237

238

CHAPTER 9

Movement disorders and ataxia

• Rural residence, farming
• MPTP (1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine)—initially
synthesized and used as an illegal street drug
• Decreased risk has been associated with cigarette smoking and caffeine
intake.
Familial PD
• Rare (often one family per mutation); multiple genotypes impacting
different proteins (or unknown products) with widely different function
resulting in similar phenotypes
• Ten or more mutations identified (e.g., PARK 1–10) on 5 or more
chromosomes
• Autosomal dominant and recessive forms
• Parkinsonian features at young age, though may present late
occasionally

Pathophysiology of PD
• Hallmarks of PD are the presence of Lewy bodies + neuronal cell
death in the pars compacta of the substantia nigra.
• PD does not develop until striatal dopamine (DA) levels drop to 20%
and substantia nigra (SN) cell loss exceeds 50%.
• Functional anatomy involved in PD includes:
• Primary motor cortex
• Supplementary motor area
• Striatum (putamen and caudate)
• Globus pallidus
• Substantia nigra (SN)
• Subthalamic nucleus (STN)
• Thalamus
• SN acts like an accelerator on the basal ganglia and damage results in
slowing.
• STN is a brake and damage therefore causes excessive movement.

Clinical features of parkinsonism
and PD
Diagnosis of a parkinsonian syndrome
Bradykinesia: slowness of initiation of voluntary movement with progressive reduction in speed and amplitude with repetition, e.g., thumb and
index finger tapping. Plus at least one of the following:
• Rigidity: increased tone; cogwheeling (a “catching” or ratcheting felt by
examiner when joints passively manipulated)
• Rest tremor:
• May be the first symptom in 75% of cases of PD.
• Twenty percent of patients never develop tremor.
• Some patients may in addition have a postural element to the
tremor—this is delayed in onset (“reemergent”), comes on a short
period after the posture is adopted.

CLINICAL FEATURES OF PARKINSONISM AND PD

• Postural instability is not caused by primary visual, vestibular, cerebellar,
or proprioceptive dysfunction.

•

Unilateral onset
Rest tremor
Progressive
Persistent asymmetry affecting the side of onset most
Good response to L-dopa
Severe L-dopa-induced chorea
L-dopa response for >25 years
Clinical course >10 years

Exclusion criteria for PD
• History of repeated strokes with stepwise progression of parkinsonian
features (vascular PD)
• History of repeated head injury
• History of definite encephalitis
• Oculogyric crises
• Neuroleptic treatment at onset of symptoms
• Sustained remission
• Strictly unilateral features after 3 years
• Supranuclear gaze palsy (PSP)
• Cerebellar signs (MSA).
• Early severe autonomic involvement (MSA)
• Early severe dementia (Lewy body dementia)
• Babinski sign (but note striatal toe may mimic)
• Negative response to L-dopa (if malabsorption excluded)
• MPTP exposure

Other features of PD
• Constipation: often the earliest symptom, beginning 1–2 decades in
advance of other symptoms
• Anosmia: 80% PD patients have decreased sense of smell. If normal
consider PSP, CBD, or MSA.
• Dystonia:
• Unusual in early disease—consider MSA
• More common after L-dopa therapy
• Bladder and bowel symptoms:
• Mild urinary symptoms. Frequency, urgency, but rarely incontinence
may occur due to detrusor hyperreflexia.
• In MSA these occur earlier and are more severe.
• Constipation is common.
• Postural hypotension: mild but may be exacerbated by levodopa and
dopamine agonists.
• Speech disorder:
• Hypophonia (monotonous and low volume)
• Tendency to repeat the first syllable (pallilalia)

239

240

CHAPTER 9

Movement disorders and ataxia

• Sleep disorders:
• Restless legs syndrome
• REM sleep behavior disorder where patients act out their dreams—
may precede other symptoms and diagnosis by a decade or more
• Dementia. In the late stage, 20% of patients may have dementia:
• With memory impairment
• Fluctuating confusion
• Visual hallucinations
• Dopaminergic medication may compound the problem.

Differential diagnosis of PD and
investigation
Differential diagnosis
• Parkinsonian syndromes
• For differential diagnoses, see Table 9.1.
• Essential tremor (ET) versus PD
• ET 10 times more prevalent than PD.
• ET is a postural ± action tremor. A severe postural tremor may be
present at rest but is not “pill rolling.”
• Patients with ET may also have vocal tremor; head tremor (“no–no”
or “yes–yes”).
• In PD there may be jaw tremor; leg rest tremor.

Investigations
• No diagnostic test for PD. Diagnosis is made on clinical grounds.
• 123I-FP-CIT SPECT scan (DaTscan). Ligand binds to the dopamine
reuptake transporter protein in the presynaptic terminals. Decrease
indicates loss of striatonigral neurons. Useful in differentiating ET from
PD, but not PD from MSA and PSP.
• Exclude Wilson disease if onset <50 years:
• Serum copper, ceruloplasmin
• 24-hour urinary copper
• Slit lamp examination for Kaiser–Fleischer rings
• MSA patients may have degeneration of Onuf nucleus—detected as
polyphasic potentials with increased latency on urethral or sphincter
EMG. Not routinely done for diagnosis.
• False positives occur in patients who have had prostatic surgery and
in occasional patients with PSP.
• Sphincter EMG has a sensitivity of 0.74 and a specificity of 0.89.
• Autonomic function tests, if MSA is in differential. Similarly, a cognitive
assessment: dementia is unusual in MSA.
• MRI (see Table 9.2).

CHAPTER 9

Movement disorders and ataxia

Drug-induced parkinsonism
• Depletion of presynaptic dopamine stores:
• Reserpine
• Tetrabenazine
• Dopaminergic blockers:
• Neuroleptic drugs: phenothiazines (chlorpromazine),
butyrophenones (haloperidol), thioxanthines (flupenthixol), and
substituted benzamides (sulpiride)
• Prochlorperazine prescribed for labyrinthine symptoms and nausea
• Metoclopramide for GI symptoms

Clinical features
• Tremor and asymmetry as in PD
• Patients may have a mixed movement disorder with untreated
parkinsonism coexisting with:
• Orofacial dyskinesia
• Stereotypies
• Akathisia
• Parkinsonism may resolve within days of drug being stopped but may
take years, especially if depot preparations have been used.
• Elderly patients may be left with residual signs.

Medical management of PD
Levodopa
Levodopa therapy remains the gold standard of treatment.
• Starting dose is Sinemet® (levodopa/carbidopa) 25/100 with meals tid.
• Side effects: nausea, vomiting, anorexia—often resolve spontaneously.
Consider domperidone, 10–30 mg tid, to treat GI symptoms.
• Modified release preparations (Sinemet® CR) have no beneficial effect
in the prevention of motor complications; however, they are especially
useful for nocturnal hypokinesia and rigidity.
• Bioavailablity of the CR preparation is 70% that of the immediate
release preparations.
• Dispersible levodopa preparation useful adjunct in kick-starting
immediately on wakening or in the case of sudden “offs” or during
episodes of nonresponsiveness.
• Motor complications develop in 50% of all PD patients after 6 years of
levodopa therapy.
• Monotherapy with DA drugs is not associated with these
complications; hence the rationale for delaying the use of levodopa
therapies in younger patients if possible.

MEDICAL MANAGEMENT OF PD

Long-term complications of levodopa therapy
• Involuntary movements or dyskinesias:
• Peak dose choreathetoid dyskinesia
• Diphasic dyskinesia
• Dystonia (painful cramp)
• Response fluctuations:
• End of dose deterioration (wearing off)
• Unpredictable on/off switching
• Psychiatric:
• Confusion
• Visual hallucinations
• Delusions
• Illusions

Dopamine agonists (DAs)
• DA drugs (Table 9.3) act directly on postsynaptic dopamine receptors
without the need for conversion to dopamine.
• DAs have a role as an alternative to levodopa as monotherapy,
particularly in younger patients, to delay the use of levodopa and its
long-term motor complications.
• In patients already on levodopa who have developed motor
complications, DAs may be used with a consequent lowering of
levodopa dosage.
Adverse effects
• All DAs: nausea, vomiting, postural hypotension, confusion,
hallucinations, somnolence
• Domperidone, 10–20 mg tid is useful for the GI side effects and
postural hypotension (peripheral effects).
• Ergot-derived DAs: ankle edema, erythromelalgia, Raynaud,
retroperitoneal fibrosis, pleural effusions, cardiac valvular disease

Apomorphine
• Apomorphine, a potent D1 and D2 agonist, has poor oral
bioavailability.
• Given by subcutaneous (SC) injection or continuous infusion.

CHAPTER 9

Movement disorders and ataxia

Indications
• SC injection of apomorphine may be used in assessing the
dopaminergic response, pattern, and distribution of dyskinesias in
patients on long-term levodopa therapy.
• Intermittent injections are used as rescue for severe “off ” periods
in patients already on maximal levodopa and DA therapy. Helpful
in painful “off ” period dystonias as well “off” period sphincter and
swallowing difficulty.
• Continuous infusion: consider in all patients with refractory motor
fluctuations that cannot be managed on oral therapy and require
>6 apomorphine SC injections. This form of treatment should be
considered prior to surgery.
• Temporary apomorphine therapy can be considered in PD patients
undergoing abdominal surgery.
Apomorphine challenge test to assess effect
• Start domperidone 30 mg tid 36 hours prior to test.
• No oral anti-parkinsonian drugs for 4–6 hours before challenge
• Normal breakfast
• Assess baseline motor function with motor examination subscale
(Section III) of the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS).
See Appendix.
• Time to rise from a chair and walk 12 meters is measured.
• Apomorphine 1.5 mg SC administered and motor response observed
for 30 minutes.
• Yawning may precede motor response.
• If no significant response, 3 mg is administered.
• Dose increased every 30 minutes up to 7–10 mg.
• Positive response is if there is an improvement in UPDRS score of
15%–20% or 25% increase in walking time

Other therapies
Anticholinergic agents
• Limited role and should only be prescribed in young patients with
severe tremor and dystonia
• Trihexyphenidyl (benzhexol) (2–5 mg tid) is most commonly used.
• Side effects are a major drawback especially in elderly patients—
confusion, cognitive impairment, nausea, dry mouth, precipitation of
closed angle glaucoma, and urinary retention.
Amantadine
• Previously used in early PD to delay the use of levodopa; with the
advent of DA drugs there is little use for this indication.
• New role in the management of drug-related dyskinesias due to
glutamate antagonistic properties.
• Dose 100–300 mg/day.
• Side effects: confusion, hallucinations, ankle edema, livedo reticularis,
insomnia (second dose at midday)

SURGICAL TREATMENT OF PD

Selegiline
• MAOI drug has a mild symptomatic effect.
• Used as adjunct therapy to levodopa
• Dose of 5 mg bd
• Side effects: confusion, hallucinations, insomnia (second dose at midday)
• New melt preparation a given at a lower dose of 1.25–2.5 mg/day
COMT inhibitors
• Increase the amount of levodopa reaching CNS
• Entacapone (200 mg) prescribed with each dose of levodopa (dose
range 400–1200 mg/day).
• Side effects: excess dopaminergic effects, dyskinesias managed by
decreased levodopa, diarrhea

Surgical treatment of PD
New surgical procedures have developed as a result of a better understanding of the pathophysiology of PD (Table 9.4).

CHAPTER 9

Movement disorders and ataxia

Management of other problems in PD
Depression
• Affects the quality of life in 40%
• Although SSRIs (e.g., citalopram and sertraline) are first choice, there is
a concern this class of drugs may cause a deterioration of parkinsonian
symptoms.
• Mirtazapine (presynaptic A2 antagonist)
• Alternative drugs are the tricyclic antidepressants.
• In severe cases electroconvulsive therapy may be an option.

Psychosis
• Occurs in 10%–15%
• Symptoms: mild illusions, visual hallucinations, and paranoid delusions
• Underlying pathophysiology is combination of development of cortical
Lewy body dementia and medication effects.
Management
• Treat any infection (urinary tract infections, bed sores, etc.).
• Correct any metabolic derangement, e.g., dehydration.
• Reduce and withdraw anticholinergics, selegiline, amantadine, DAs, and,
lastly, levodopa.
• If necessary, balance between “mad and mobile” and “stiff but sane.”
• Consider addition of a newer generation of antipsychotic drugs, e.g.,
quetiapine 25–50 mg daily to bid. Low-dose clozapine (6.25–50 mg,
mean 25 mg) has been shown to be effective. Agranulocytosis occurs in
1.2% of patients using clozapine.

Dementia
• Features of Lewy body dementia include visual hallucinations, a
fluctuating course with lucid intervals, and an exquisite sensitivity to
neuroleptic drugs.
• Benefit with the use of cholinesterase inhibitor drugs used in the
treatment of AD, such as donepezil and rivastigmine.

Sleep disturbance
Common problem due to combination of factors:
• Stiffness and rigidity, making it difficult to turn in bed. Consider CR
levodopa preparations or cabergoline.
• Bladder disturbance due to detrusor hyperreflexia resulting in nocturia.
Oxybutynin and tolterodine may help.
• Restless legs: CR levodopa or cabergoline at night
• Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD) where
purposeful nocturnal motor activity occurs during REM sleep phase.
Clonazepam 0.5–2 mg is effective.

MULTIPLE SYSTEM ATROPHY (MSA)

Excess saliva due to an inability to swallow
• Can be treated with anticholinergic drugs but will have significant side
effects
• Hyoscine patches behind the ear
• Instillation of atropine drops 0.5% on the tongue two or three times
a day
• Botulinum toxin injection or radiation therapy into the parotid glands if
unresponsive and problematical
“Freezing”:
• especially in doorways: visual, patterned cues across doorway help. Use
of “laser cane” to step over beam.

Falls and postural instability
• Occur late in the course of the disease and are unresponsive to
medication
• Multidisciplinary assessment with a physiotherapist and occupational
therapist to acquire walking aids and make appropriate adaptations

Multiple system atrophy (MSA)
Within the spectrum of MSA:
• Parkinsonism poorly responsive to levodopa
• Striatonigral degeneration
• Olivopontocerebellar atrophy
• Autonomic failure with urinary incontinence and orthostatic
hypotension
Overlap occurs with disease progression.

Epidemiology
• Presentation usually in sixth decade
• Life expectancy is around 6 years from onset.
• There are no familial cases reported.

Pathophysiology
• Targeted areas are the striatum, substantia nigra, brainstem nuclei,
dentate nuclei of the cerebellum, anteromedial columns of the spinal
cord, and Onuf spinal nucleus, which innervates urethral and anal
sphincters.
• Pathological specimens reveal argyrophilic neuronal and glial
cytoplasmic inclusions positive for alpha synuclein.

Clinical features
• Parkinsonian form (MSA-P) presents with an akinetic rigid syndrome.
Tremor is less frequent than in PD.
• Olivopontocerebellar variant (MSA–C) presents with ataxia.

247

248

CHAPTER 9

Movement disorders and ataxia

• Autonomic involvement with impotence in men, anorgasmia in
women; orthostatic hypotension not due to drugs; urinary urgency and
incontinence early in the disease may be a pointer to MSA.
• Bulbar involvement can lead to laryngeal stridor and sleep apnea.
• Pyramidal involvement not severe: brisk reflexes, extensor plantar
responses that in a patient with PD could be due to vascular disease or
cervical spondylosis
• Other clinical signs:
• Dusky blue hands due to autonomic involvement
• Marked antecollis
• Painful dystonias
• Low-amplitude myoclonic jerks of the outstretched fingers
(polyminimyoclonus)
• Cognitive problems rare

Investigations
• Autonomic function tests may confirm the clinical findings.
• Sphincter EMG may show denervation of the external anal sphincter
(but denervation can also be found in PSP).
MRI
• MSA-P:
• Atrophy of stratum/putamen > caudate
• Putaminal hypointensity (posterolateral margin) + thin rim of
hyperintense signal
• Decreased width of pars compacta
• MSA-C (see Fig. 9.2)
• Pontine atrophy
• Atrophy of middle cerebellar peduncles, cerebellum + inferior
olives
• T2W hyperintensity (“hot cross bun sign”)

Management
• Fifty percent of MSA cases are L-dopa responsive.
• If no response or significant side effects, try amantadine (100 mg bid).
• Orthostatic hypotension:
• Reduce dopaminergic drugs
• TED stockings
• Head up tilt at night
• High salt intake
• Fludrocortisone (0.1–0.2 mg at night): side effect, supine
hypertension, fluid retention
• Midodrine (2.5 mg, increase to 10 mg tid): side effect, supine
hypertension
• Bladder urgency: oxybutynin 2.5 mg bid, maximum 5 mg tid
• Nocturia: intranasal DDAVP 20–40 µg at night; Side effect, hyponatremia

CHAPTER 9

Movement disorders and ataxia

Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP)
Also called Steele–Richardson–Olszewski syndrome.

Incidence Usual onset in the sixth and seventh decades. The median
survival is 7 years from onset.
Pathophysiology
• Tau-positive neurofibrillary tangles found in the pallidum, substantia
nigra, periaqueductal grey matter, and superior colliculi
• Frontal cortical involvement

Clinical features
• Presentation with a symmetrical akinetic rigid syndrome with the axial
trunk and neck muscles being more affected than the limbs. It can also
present with ataxic features.
• Tremor is uncommon.
• Falls backward early in the course of disease.
• Supranuclear gaze palsy affecting downgaze more than upgaze is the
most distinctive feature with symptoms of difficulty scanning the
printed page and walking downstairs.
• Other features:
• “Stair case” up gaze
• Square wave jerks of eyes at rest
• Inability to converge eyes
• Surprised look due to frontalis overactivity
• Growling dysarthria with pallilalia
• Dysphagia
• Apraxia of eyelid opening
• Impairment of frontal lobe executive function with a frontal lobe
dementia later in the disease with personality change and emotional
lability
• Bladder symptoms are unusual and occur late.

Investigations
MRI
• Midbrain atrophy (“Mickey Mouse ears”) due to enlargement of 3rd
ventricle + interpeduncular fossa + decreased AP diameter of midbrain
+ depression of superior midbrain on sagittal images (“hummingbird
sign”).
• T2W hyperintense signal periaqueductal grey matter + globus pallidus
• Frontotemporal atrophy

Management
•
•
•
•

Response to levodopa is usually poor.
Amantadine should be tried.
PEG tube feeding necessary in severe dysphagia.
Pneumonia is the most common cause of death.

CHOREA, ATHETOSIS, AND BALLISM

Corticobasal degeneration (CBD)
Incidence Presents in the sixth and seventh decades.
Pathophysiology
• Degeneration of posterior frontal, inferior parietal, and superior
temporal cortices, thalami, substantia nigra, and cerebellar dentate
nuclei
• Tau deposition in swollen achromatic neurons

Clinical features
• Striking asymmetry at onset and throughout the disease course usually
involving one limb.
• Combination of akinetic rigidity and cortical features. The latter are:
• Apraxia;
• Cortical sensory loss (simultagnosia and dysgraphesthesia)
• “Alien limb phenomenon”: hand may interfere with activities of the
other arm or grasp onto doors and handles
• Other features:
• Stimulus-sensitive myoclonus
• Painful limb dystonia
• Bulbar problems with dysphagia and dysarthria

Investigations
MRI shows asymmetric cortical atrophy in clinically affected areas.

Management
• Poor response to levodopa
• Clonazepam and sodium valproate may be used for troublesome
myoclonus.
• PEG tube feeding may be necessary in severe dysphagia.

Hyperkinetic movement disorders
Hyperkinetic movement disorders are characterized by involuntary movements that are sometimes suppressible for a period of time. The prototypical hyperkinetic movement disorder is HD.

Chorea, athetosis, and ballism
Chorea, athetosis, and ballism represent a continuum of movements of
increasing amplitude and explosiveness (see Table 9.5).
• Chorea: rapid, jerky movements of irregular timing
• Athetosis: writhing of limbs, most prominent distally
• Ballism: large amplitude “flinging” of a limb; proximal activation of
muscles

Sydenham chorea is one of the major clinical manifestations of acute rheumatic fever (caused by Group A Streptococcus) and the most common
form of acquired chorea in children. Incidence has dramatically decreased
in developed countries due to availability of antibiotic treatment for
Streptococcal infection.

Clinical features
• Chorea: onset 1–8 months after untreated Streptococcal infection
• Recurrence in 20%–30% of patients 3–10 years after acute event
• Emotional lability may precede chorea.
• Hypotonia, poor fine motor control, weakness

253

254

CHAPTER 9

Movement disorders and ataxia

Pathophysiology
• Through the mechanism of molecular mimicry, antibodies produced
in response to antigen from Streptococcal infection target neuronal
structures in basal ganglia and cortex.

Diagnosis
• Clinical diagnosis based on history and presentation
• Anti-streptolysin O titer may be helpful
• Present in 80%
• Positive at low titer with other infections

Differential diagnosis
See Table 9.5.

Treatment
• Prednisone (1 mg/kg daily x 2 weeks, then taper over 2–3 weeks)
• Valproate or carbamazepine as alternative to steroids
• Neuroleptic medications for refractory or severe cases
• Penicillin daily x 10 days or as depot injection
• Erythromycin an alternative if allergies to penicillin

Tremor
Tremor is the involuntary rhythmic oscillation of a body part caused by synchronous or alternating contraction of antagonist muscle groups. Tremor
may be classified on basis of frequency of oscillation and by the setting in
which it occurs (e.g., at rest, with intentional movement). A high-frequency
physiologic tremor (10–12 Hz) is present in all persons but not usually
appreciated unless enhanced by anxiety, fatigue, or metabolic dysregulation
(e.g., thyrotoxicosis).

Diagnosis (see Table 9.6)
• Assess setting
• Rest tremor—occurring at rest
• Postural-action tremor—present with certain postures or actions
without variation
• Intention tremor—action tremor that increases in amplitude as goal
neared or with specific activity
• Assess frequency
• Consider symmetry, limbs involved, associated symptoms

either used alone.
• For nonresponders to propranolol and/or primidone:
• Atenolol
• Gabapentin

256

CHAPTER 9

Movement disorders and ataxia

• Topiramate
• Botox A
• Surgical intervention in failed medical therapy and with severe disability
• Unilateral thalamotomy
• Thalamic deep brain stimulation (DBS)
Though ET will respond to alcohol and to benzodiazepines such as alprazolam, it is best to avoid these due to potential for addiction.

Dystonias
Dystonias represent the most common movement disorder after PD.
Dystonia is characterized by sustained agonist/antagonist muscle contractions, which may involve any muscles—limb, axial, or cranial. Dystonias may
be hereditary (multiple genes have been identified and more are being
elucidated) or acquired; may occur at rest or with action; may be sustained,
intermittently triggered, or rhythmic.
• Action dystonia—worsened during voluntary movements of affected
body part or segment
• Overflow dystonia—worsened during voluntary action of any body
part or segment, unrelated to the affected body part or segment.
Talking is most common trigger of overflow dystonia.
• Task-specific dystonia—worsened with specific voluntary action
• Torsion dystonia—muscle contractions cause a twisting movement
• Dystonic tremor—rapid spasms of muscles in repetitive pattern
• Dystonic storm = status dystonicus: sudden increase of established
dystonia, which may result in rhabdomyolysis and renal failure; a rare
phenomenon usually seen only in children or adolescents
Dystonic movements can be more severe with fatigue, stress, and strong
emotion. They are relieved by rest and during sleep unless quite severe.
Dystonias may be classified by age of onset (0–12 years, 13–20 years, >21
years), by anatomic distribution (focal, segmental, multifocal, generalized,
or hemi-body), or by etiology (primary/idiopathic, dystonia plus, secondary,
associated with heredodegenerative diseases)

Etiology
Primary dystonias
A diverse group of familial and sporadic dystonias of which dystonic postures or movement are the only neurological abnormalities. At least four
gene loci have been identified (DYT1, DYT6, DYT7, and DYT13). The
best-characterized and most representative of the primary dystonias is
Oppenheim dystonia.
Primary (Oppenheim) dystonia
• Prevalence 1:3000. Common in Ashkenazi Jews but seen in other ethnic
groups also
• AD:
• DYT I gene on chromosome 9 (coding for torsin A protein)
• Low penetrance (30%)
• Variable expression

DYSTONIAS

Clinical features
• Childhood onset
• Initially focal (foot); variable spread to segmental or generalized. In
advanced cases, body parts may remain in fixed postures.
• Craniocervical muscles are usually spared.
Adult-onset primary dystonias
• Prevalence in United States ~30/100,000
• Increased rates of dystonia among family members suggests underlying
genetic contribution.
• Usually localized to specific muscles or body segments
• Cervical dystonia—most common of localized dystonias
• Facial dystonia—blepharospasm or oromandibular dystonia
• Hand/arm—writer’s or musician’s cramp
• Vocal cords—spastic dysphonia (vocalis muscle contraction) or
breathy dysphonia (posterior cricoarytenoid contractions)
• Botulinum toxin may provide relief of localized dystonias.
Dystonia plus syndromes
• Dystonia coexists with Parkinsonism or myoclonus. The most
important (treatable) of all the dystonic syndromes is dopa-responsive
dystonia.
Dopa-responsive dystonia (DRD)—Segawa disease
• AD:
• Mutation in gene for GTP cyclohydrolase 1
• AR form due to mutation in tyrosine hydroxylase gene.
Clinical features
• Childhood lower limb onset progressing to generalized dystonia
• Diurnal variation in symptoms
• Mild parkinsonism
• Paraparesis presentation
• Also cases described similar to cerebral palsy
• Exquisite response to L-dopa
Management
• Therapeutic trial of L-dopa in all cases of dystonia <30 years: Sinemet
275 tid for 3 months
In equivocal cases, perform phenylalanine loading test, checking phenylalanine and tyrosine blood levels at several time points. An elevated phenylalanine/tyrosine ratio at 4 hours is highly sensitive and specific for DRD.
Secondary dystonias
Result of insult or injury to the central or peripheral nervous system or as
a drug-induced phenomenon. Causes are myriad and include trauma, vascular insults, infection, tumors, rheumatological disorders, toxic/metabolic
insults, and psychogenic disorders. A careful clinical history is essential to
identify or exclude a secondary dystonia and should direct the following
workup:
• Laboratory studies (complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic
studies, PTH, HIV, ANA, antiphospholipids, suspected toxins)

257

258

CHAPTER 9

Movement disorders and ataxia

• Lumbar puncture (CJD, MS, infectious)
• Imaging of the neuraxis
• NCS/EMG if peripheral nerve injury suspected
Dystonia and heredodegenerative diseases
Dystonia may be part of a number of inherited degenerative or metabolic
diseases. Dystonia is late developing or part of a complex of symptoms.
The associated nondystonic symptoms lead to diagnosis and are clues that
the syndrome is not primarily a dystonic syndrome.

Treatment of dystonia
• Always consider trial of L-dopa therapy
• Botulinum toxin trial if possible
• Pharmacological therapy:
• Anticholinergic (trihexyphenidyl)
• Baclofen (up to 80–120 mg/day in divided doses)
• Benzodiazepines (clonazepam, diazepam)
• Antidopaminergics
• Surgical interventions
• Intrathecal baclofen
• DBS of the internal globus pallidus has replaced cervical rhizotomy,
thalamotomy and pallidotomy as surgical treatment of choice when
symptoms otherwise uncontrolled and disabling.

Myoclonus
Myoclonus is characterized by rapid (<100 msec in duration) discrete simple jerks of a body part through involuntary activation (or inactivation)
of muscle.
• Positive myoclonus: brief activation of muscle (myoclonus)
• Negative myoclonus: inactivation of muscle (asterixis)

Clinical manifestations
• Single or repetitive muscle jerks elicited by excessive discharge from a
group of neurons
• Irregular and unpredictable usually but can occur rarely in bursts or
rhythmically
• Can be stimulus sensitive
• Essential or physiological myoclonus not uncommon at interface
of sleep and wake (hypnic jerks) or during sleep (periodic limb
movements of sleep)

Classification
• Clinical
• At rest, with action, or with intention
• Focal, segmental, multifocal, or generalized
• Irregular, oscillatory, rhythmic

MYOCLONUS

• Generator
• Cortical—with EEG correlates
• Thalamic
• Brainstem
• Spinal
• Peripheral (through ephaptic transmission of nerve impulses—
usually secondary to demyelination—rare)
• Etiology
• Essential (physiological, periodic limb movements of sleep, occurring
at interface of sleep/wake, hiccoughs)
• Epileptic (epilepsia partialis continuans, myoclonic epilepsies)
• Symptomatic (see Table 9.7)

Investigations
• Guided by type of myoclonus and associated features
• MRI may be indicated if central lesions suspected
• EEG to assess for spike correlates of cortical myoclonus—though may
be false negative (normal)
• Review of drug and toxin exposure
• General metabolic workup (liver/kidney function, electrolytes,
complete blood count)
• Infectious or paraneoplastic workup if indicated
• Review of family history

Treatment
•
•
•
•
•

Valproate
Clonazepam

Myoclonic syndromes of note
Palatal myoclonus: primary or secondary
• 2 Hz rhythmic tremor
• Secondary form due to lesion in Guillain-Mollaret triangle of brainstem
(defined by dentate nucleus of cerebellum, olivary, and red nuclei of
brainstem)
• The only movement disorder that persists during sleep (if secondary
in etiology)
• May be associated with ocular myoclonus
• Patients may note clicking sound in ears
Lance-Adams syndrome
• Acquired syndrome after hypoxia, most commonly seen after
cardiopulmonary resuscitation
• Myoclonic jerks with action; also cerebellar ataxia
• Myoclonus can develop days or weeks after acute hypoxic event
• Myoclonus worst with actions requiring greatest fine motor control

Often associated with ataxia

Opsoclonus-myoclonus syndrome
• “Dancing eyes, dancing feet”: rare autoimmune disorder
• Polyminimyoclonus—muscle jerks are of small amplitude
• Involuntary chaotic saccades of eyes
• Pathognomonic for neuroblastoma in children, but it can also be seen
in postviral and paraneoplastic syndromes in children and adults

Myoclonic startle syndromes
Hyperekplexia
Startle stimulus may provoke an exaggerated and complex involuntary
motor response, leading to a fall.

Tics
Involuntary simple or complex movement or vocalization that may be suppressed for brief periods of time but “bursts through” as inner urge or
unpleasant sensation increases—and then is relieved as tic occurs.
• Common in childhood with transient tic disorders (symptoms
persisting less than 1 year) seen in up to 25% of children
• Most common presentation is with eye blinking, facial grimace, or head
shaking; more severe cases may involve limbs.

TICS

• Simple tics require no treatment and often resolve spontaneously.
• Simple tics difficult to distinguish from other movement disorders.
Distinguishing characteristics of a tic are as follows:
• Building premonitory sensation
• Intermittency
• Suppressibility
• Consider secondary causes of tic when onset (in children or adults) is
sudden or tics are severe:
• Neuroacanthocytosis
• Medication use (e.g., neuroleptics, dopamine agonists)
• Infection (e.g., PANDAS or encephalitis)
• CJD
• Head trauma, stroke

Tourette syndrome
Tourette syndrome is the most common of the persistent (>1 year duration) tic disorders and is characterized by multiple motor and vocal tics,
with onset at about 5 years of age (though has been noted as early as 2
years of age), worsening of tics with peak at about 10–11 years of age, and
decline in severity with 50% of patients having resolution of symptoms
by age 18. Recurrence in adulthood can occur. Common comorbidities
include ADHD, OCD, and behavioral issues (e.g., impulse control). More
common in boys than girls (4.3:1 in one large registry).
Diagnostic criteria
• Multiple motor tics and one or more vocal tics must be present at
some time, though not necessarily concurrently
• Tics must occur multiple times daily or intermittently for >1 year.
• Anatomical location, frequency, type, complexity, or severity of tics
must change over time
• Onset of tics before age 21
• Motor and vocal tics must be substantiated by reliable observer.
• No other alternative explanation for tics can be found.
Pathophysiology
• Thought to be inherited dysregulation in the striatal-thalamic-cortical
spinal system resulting in disinhibition in the motor and limbic systems
• PET studies demonstrate increased dopamine storage and release in
the striatum.
Treatment
• None required if patient not troubled physically or socially by
symptoms. Reassurance given; tics may remit.
• Pharmacological management
• Dopamine antagonists (e.g., fluphenazine, pimozide, and
tetrabenazine)
• Dopamine agonist (e.g., ropinirole)
• Alpha adrenergic agonists (e.g., clonidine, guanfacine)
• SSRIs

261

262

CHAPTER 9

Movement disorders and ataxia

• Botulinum toxin—for focal motor or vocal tics
• Treatment of ADHD (common in patients with Tourette syndrome)
with stimulants may worsen tics.
• Consider comorbidities in choosing treatment options:
• Tourette + ADHD: methylphenidate or dextroamphetamine
• Tourette + OCD: SSRIs
• Tourette + impulsive behavior: clonidine or guanfacine

Ataxia
Ataxia (“without control”) refers to loss of coordination of voluntary
movements; cerebellar ataxia represents damage or dysfunction of the
cerebellum and/or its afferent or efferent pathways. Incoordination may
affect voluntary muscular function of limbs, trunk, vocal cords, and eye
muscles resulting in:
• Postural and/or gait instability
• Dysmetria: undershoot or overshoot of intended movement to a
target
• Dysdiadokinesia: inability to perform rhythmic movements
Ataxia also results if the sensory organs feeding information to the cerebellar afferent pathways are damaged:
• Vestibular ataxia: damage to the vestibular system. Key features are
nausea, vomiting, vertigo, and disequilibrium.
• Sensory ataxia: severe loss of peripheral sensory nerves responsible for
proprioception. The cerebellum is hindered in its function as it receives
no feedback on where a body part is in space at any given time. Severe
sensory ataxia may result in inability to stand, to maintain a sitting
posture, or to manipulate objects in the environment.
Cerebellar ataxias may be classified into hereditary, sporadic, and acquired
forms. Hereditary forms may be classified by young onset (<21 years) versus older onset (>21 years) or by type of inheritance (autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, X-linked, and sporadic). In general, autosomal
dominant cerebellar ataxias are of late onset; autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxias are of young onset; however, exceptions occur.
Mitochondrial disorders (e.g., Leigh syndrome, MELAS, MERFF) and
many hereditary metabolic disorders (e.g., storage disorders, urea cycle
disorders, aminoacidurias, disorders of lactate/pyruvate metabolism, sialidosis, myoclonic epilepsies) may have associated intermittent or progressive ataxia; however, this is often not the most prominent or defining
feature of the disorder.

HEREDITARY ATAXIAS

Hereditary ataxias
The hereditary ataxias are often recognized and classified by their manner
of inheritance and their associated symptoms and signs, which help direct
genetic testing to elucidate underlying defect.

Autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias (SCA 1–8, 9–22, 25,
DRPLA, and the episodic ataxias EA 1–7)
Common characteristics
• Onset of ataxia in young adult or mid-adult years (though wide
variation)
• Gait ataxia and falls, prominent early in course
• Limb ataxia and dysarthria
• Hyperreflexia early in course with later hypo- or areflexia
• Loss of vibratory perception and proprioception late in course
• Nystagmus, slow saccades, abnormal pursuit with eye movements
• Anticipation (earlier onset and more severe disease seen in succeeding
generations) related to unstable trinucleotide repeat abnormality
(CAG–glutamine) in many of the dominant ataxias.
Each of the autosomal dominant SCAs has distinguishing clinical features
and an underlying genetic abnormality that aid in identification (Table 9.8).
They also may be thought of in more general terms and grouped accordingly (see Table 9.9).
Episodic ataxias
• Intermittent self-resolving episodes of cerebellar ataxia
• Seven identified; EA-1 and EA-2 most common (both are
channelopathies). See Table 9.10
• Different mutations in the CACNA1A gene associated with EA2 are
responsible for SCA6 and hemiplegic migraine.

Movement disorders and ataxia

Box 9.1 Highlight on Friedrich Ataxia
Trinucleotide (GAA) mutation in frataxin gene. Ninety-six percent have
an expansion in both alleles. Others have a point mutation in one allele
and expansion in other. Diagnosis excluded if two normal sized alleles.
Clinical features
• Gait ataxia, usual onset in children or teens, but can begin in later
adult life
• Pyramidal weakness and signs, extensor plantars
• Axonal peripheral neuropathy (absent ankle jerks)
• Optic atrophy leading to mildly decreased visual acuity
• Abnormal eye movements: nystagmus (25%), broken pursuit,
hypometric saccades, macrosaccadic square wave jerks
• Deafness (10%)
• Skeletal abnormalities: pes cavus (50%) and scoliosis (75%)
• ECG abnormalities: widespread T wave inversion. Screen for
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (25%)
• Diabetes or glucose intolerance (20%)
• Mean age of death: mid-30s through infection or cardiac arrhythmias
or heart failure
Late-onset forms occur with retained reflexes and lower limb spasticity
and are without ataxia and/or cardiomyopathy.
Pathophysiology
Lack of or abnormal frataxin (a mitochondrial protein whose function is
not fully elucidated but felt to be an antioxidant through its involvement
in iron metabolism)
Studies
• MRI: dorsal column and cerebellar atrophy
• NCS/EMG: demyelinating peripheral neuropathy
• ECG abnormalities
• Genetic testing is confirmatory.
• Always check vitamin E levels because vitamin E deficiency is a
treatable mimic.

X-linked cerebellar ataxias
• Rare except for Fragile X–tremor ataxia syndrome (CCG trinucleotide
expansion)
• Heterogeneous
• Fragile X–tremor ataxia syndrome (presentation in adult males).
(See Box 9.2.)
• Pure ataxia of early onset (childhood or adolescent onset)
• Ataxia and spastic paraplegia (childhood or adolescent onset)
• Ataxia, deafness, optic atrophy, hypotonia (infantile onset)
• X-linked sideroblastic anemia with (nonprogressive) cerebellar
ataxia

(FRXTAS)
Trinucleotide (CCG) expansion in the FMR1 gene responsible for Fragile
X syndrome (common cause of mental retardation in males)
• <55 repeats: normal
• 55–200 repeats: FRXTAS
• >200 repeats: Fragile X syndrome
Clinical features
• Presentation in older males with carrier prevalence as high as 1:800
• Presentation in women through inactivation of normal X
• Ataxia and postural tremor
• Other features can include cognitive deficits, parkinsonism, proximal
lower limb weakness, and peripheral neuropathy.
• MRI imaging with generalized brain atrophy and high T2 signal in
middle cerebellar peduncles
Genetic testing recommended for:
• Men >50 years old with unexplained ataxia
• Men >50 years old with action tremor, cognitive decline or
parkinsonism in setting of family history or persons with premature
ovarian failure, mental retardation, autism, or developmental delay
• Men >50 years old with middle cerebellar peduncle sign on MRI

Sporadic ataxias
• Often present late in adulthood: after age 40, commonly in seventh
decade
• Sporadic mutation of known ADCA sometimes identified
• Can have rapidly progression of ataxia
• Less likely (than in autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias) to have
associated noncerebellar degenerative symptoms
• Parkinsonism and upper motor neuron signs common
• Associated autonomic dysfunction may lead to classification as MSA

Acquired ataxias
Any insult within the cerebellum or its pathways may result in ataxia.
Acquired causes are diverse and include the following:
• Vascular issues: stroke or vascular malformation
• Neoplasm or paraneoplastic disorder (see Table 9.11)
• Autoimmune or inflammatory disease (MS, sarcoid, SLE)
• Toxic/metabolic: Vitamin (E, B12) deficiency, copper deficiency,
hypothyroidism, alcohol abuse
A careful history and examination guides diagnostic procedures.

CHAPTER 10

Sleep disorders

Approach to the patient with a
sleep disorder
• As sleep disorders and sleep-related complaints occur commonly,
the clinician should use a systematic approach to consider currently
described diagnostic categories and develop appropriate treatment
options.
• Patients with sleep complaints usually present with one or more of
three types of problems:
• Insomnia
• Abnormal movements, behaviors, or sensations during sleep or
nocturnal awakenings
• Excessive daytime sleepiness
• As in any other diagnostic evaluations, begin with a full history of the
sleep-related complaint.
• Ideally, the evaluation includes a history from the patient’s bed partner
for comments on intensity of snoring and presence of apneas and
abnormal behaviors.
• Questions about the sleep–wake schedule are important.
• Sleep schedule: time to bed, time to sleep onset, number and times
of awakenings, time of final awakening
• Waking schedule: naps, meals, alcohol, times and doses of
medications, times and amounts of alcohol, caffeine, nicotine

Sleep physiology
• Sleep is an active process that includes alterations in the physiology of
most organs and systems.
• Sleep stages are classified based on three measures:
electroencephalogram (EEG), eye movements obtained by
electrooculography (EOG), and muscle tone as assessed by
electromyography (EMG) of the mentalis muscle.
• There are two major states: non-rapid eye-movement sleep (NREM)
and rapid eye movement sleep (REM)
• These alternate cyclically across sleep episodes.
• State characteristics:
NREM sleep: synchronous EEG; low muscle tone; four stages
REM sleep: desynchronized EEG, muscles are atonic, dreaming is
typical; one stage

NREM sleep
• Stage 1—also known as drowsiness; low-voltage, mixed-frequency EEG,
slowly rolling eye movements
• Stage 2—moderate low-voltage EEG; hallmark is sleep spindles (bursts
of 12–15 Hz activity, lasting 0.5–2 seconds); K complexes (brief highvoltage discharges with an initial negative deflection followed by a
positive component)

CLASSIFICATION OF SLEEP DISORDERS

• Stage 3—high amplitude delta (2 to 3 Hz) activity occupying 20%–50%
of the background
• Stage 4— similar to stage 3 except that delta activity comprises more
than 50% of the EEG record
• Expressed when a network of neurons in the anterior and posterior
hypothalamus, midbrain, and brainstem create conditions that favor
decreased metabolic rate and promote neuronal synchrony through
the thalamus

REM sleep
• EEG is of lowest voltage mixed frequency activity; intermittent bursts
of rapid conjugate eye movements (REM) occur; tonic chin EMG
activity is absent or markedly reduced (reflection of muscle paralysis
resulting from active inhibition of muscle activity), phasic muscle
discharges occur in irregular bursts
• Activation of cholinergic neurons occurs in the pontine dorsal
tegmentum, causing activation of reticular neurons in the medulla
with subsequent loss of muscular movements, but with rapid eye
movements.
• REM sleep is inhibited by activation of the dorsal raphe and locus
ceruleus.

Diagnostic procedures
Clinical polysomnography (PSG)
• Simultaneous recording of sleep and multiple variables
• Variables include: EEG, EOG, mentalis EMG, surface EMG of the
anterior tibialis muscle (for detection of leg movements in sleep),
electrocardiogram (ECG), measurement of nasal and oral airflow,
respiratory effort, oxygen saturation

Multiple sleep latency test (MSLT)
• A series of four to five nap opportunities with sleep recordings at
2-hour intervals throughout the day
• Typically done after one night of PSG recording to evaluate for
underlying sleep disorders such as narcolepsy
• Nap is terminated 15 minutes after sleep onset.
• If no sleep occurs, session is terminated after 20 minutes.

Classification of sleep disorders
International Classification of Sleep Disorders, version 2 (ICSD-2), published in 2005, combines a symptomatic presentation (e.g., insomnia) with
one organized in part on pathophysiology (e.g., circadian rhythms) and in
part on body systems (e.g., breathing disorders).

271

272

CHAPTER 10

Sleep disorders

ICSD-2 has eight major categories:
• Insomnias
• Sleep-related breathing disorders
• Hypersomnias not due to a breathing disorder
• Parasomnias
• Circadian rhythm sleep disorders
• Sleep-related movement disorders
• Isolated symptoms, apparently normal variants, and unresolved issues
(not included here)
• Other sleep disorders (not included here)

Insomnias
Definition Difficulty falling asleep, maintaining sleep (frequent awaken-

ings with inability or difficulty returning to sleep), or early awakening, combined with impaired daytime functioning (fatigue, irritability, inattention).

Classification
Primary insomnias
• Psychophysiological: acute (adjustment sleep disorder)
• Chronic
• Idiopathic
• Sleep state misperception
Secondary insomnias
• Sleep disorders (sleep apnea, periodic leg movement disorder, restless
leg syndrome)
• Psychiatric disorders (depression, anxiety, panic attacks)
• Inadequate sleep hygiene
• Environmental sleep disorders
• Drugs (nicotine, ethanol, caffeine)
• Medical conditions/medications
• Fibromyalgia and chronic pain syndromes
• COPD and other respiratory disorders
• Medications (beta-blockers, theophylline)
• Circadian disorders
• Delayed sleep-phase syndrome
• Advanced sleep-phase syndrome
• Shift work or jet lag syndrome
Epidemiology
• Overall, 10%–20% of adults report chronic insomnia.
• More prevalent in women than men (3:2)
• Higher rates in elderly (over 65 years of age), unemployed people, low
educational levels
Clinical features
• Common complaints
• Difficulty falling asleep (sleep-onset insomnia)
• Frequent nighttime awakenings with inability to return to sleep

SLEEP-RELATED BREATHING DISORDERS

• Early morning awakenings
• Daytime symptoms
• Sense of nonrestorative sleep
• Irritability
• Mood changes
• Anxiety
• Poor concentration and attention
• Decline in work performance
Diagnosis
• Careful history and clinical interview
• Review of patient sleep diary (ideally completed for 2 weeks prior to
initial evaluation)
• Polysomnography (PSG)—minor role, generally not indicated in
evaluation of insomnia (except to rule out periodic leg movements of
sleep, sleep apnea, or if insomnia is severe and does not respond to
conventional therapy)
Differential diagnosis
• Psychiatric illnesses (depression, anxiety disorders)
• Primary sleep disorders: periodic limb movement disorder (PLMD),
restless leg syndrome (RLS), sleep-related breathing disorders
• Circadian rhythm disorders
• Parasomnias
Treatment
• Should target the underlying cause; therefore, often a single approach
may not be sufficient
• Education about better sleep hygiene
• Treatment of any underlying psychiatric disorder
• Proper timing of medications used to treat a medical disorder
• Behavioral therapy—relaxation therapy, stimulus control, sleep hygiene,
potentially sleep restriction
• Hypnotic medications—most helpful in acute insomnia; should be
limited to a 2–4 week course if possible, to avoid dependence
• Commonly prescribed hypnotics
• Benzodiazepines: Flurazepam (Dalmane), Clonazepam (Klonopin),
Temazepam (Restoril), Triazolam (Halcion)
• Nonbenzodiazepines: Zolpidem (Ambien), Zaleplon (Sonata)

Sleep-related breathing disorders
Breathing during sleep
• Respiratory patterns change according to sleep stage
• NREM sleep
Occasional pauses in breathing near sleep onset
Some breathing periodicity during lighter stages of sleep
Regular breathing during stage 3–4 (delta wave or slow wave sleep)
• REM sleep

273

274

CHAPTER 10

Sleep disorders

Inspiratory time decreases and breathing becomes more irregular.
• Regulation of breathing is unique, under both voluntary and automatic
control.
• Control of breathing pattern becomes entirely involuntary with sleep
onset, with increased regularity in respiration during NREM sleep.
• Response to high CO2 levels and low oxygen levels is blunted during
both slow-wave sleep (stage 3,4) and REM sleep.

Snoring
• Produced by the vibration of soft tissues of the upper airways
• Can occur during inspiration or expiration
• Loudest and most frequent during slow wave sleep, softest during REM
sleep
• A cardinal symptom of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), but its absence
does not exclude the diagnosis
• Simple snoring: patients with snoring and no symptoms and signs of
OSA
• May increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases and eventual
development of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)

Sleep apnea
• Apnea: absence of ventilation, with absence of airflow, for at least 10
seconds
• Hypopnea: partial reduction of airflow from the preceding baseline, for
10 seconds or longer
• Both respiratory events are associated with oxygen desaturations and
arousals and tend to be more frequent during lighter stages of NREM
and REM sleep.

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)
OSA-hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS) is one of the most common sleep
disorders and the most common form of sleep apnea.
Epidemiology
• General population or community-based cohort studies of patients
between 30 and 60 years of age estimate that 2%–5% of the population
have OSAHS.
• Higher incidence in men (2.5 times more common) than in women
• Prevalence tends to be higher in African Americans, independent of the
effects related to obesity
Clinical presentation
• Snoring
• Excessive daytime sleepiness or fatigue
• Witnessed apneas
• Dry mouth, sore throat
• Excessive nighttime sweating

SLEEP-RELATED BREATHING DISORDERS

•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Insomnia
Impaired daytime efficiency
Diminished intellectual performance
Morning or nocturnal headache, irritability, or personality change
Depression
Decreased libido or impotence
Predisposing factors: obesity, narrow nasal passage, long soft palate,
enlarged tonsils, retroflexed mandible

Systemic effects
• Systemic hypertension
• Pulmonary hypertension
• Diabetes mellitus
• Cardiac enlargement, myocardial infarction
• Hypoxemia
• Stroke
• Poor memory or impaired attention
• Increased risk of sudden death during sleep
Complications
• Life-threatening vehicular and occupational accidents
• Failure to gain weight and growth in infants and children
Diagnostic evaluation
• Clinical history of snoring and observed apneas/hypopneas, excessive
daytime sleepiness
• Standard polysomnography
• Monitoring of intraesophageal pressure (measures respiratory effort)
or end-tidal CO2
Treatment
• Goal is to keep the airway open during sleep
• Determine severity of illness to select the appropriate treatment
• Apnea-hypopnea index (AHI)—an overall index of the frequency of
respiratory disturbance
• Mild: 5–14 events/hr
• Moderate: 15–30 events/hr
• Severe: >30 events/hr
• Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP):
• Most common and effective treatment
• Constant air pressure is generated by a small pump and delivered
via tubing to a nasal mask.
• Upper airway surgery on posterior soft palate and uvula
• Oral appliances—used during sleep to advance the lower jaw
• Weight loss
• Supplemental oxygen

275

276

CHAPTER 10

Sleep disorders

Central sleep apnea (CSA)
Characteristics
• Pauses in breathing without ventilatory effort or cessation in airflow of
at least 10 seconds associated with absence of respiratory effort
• Occasional central apneas may be seen in patients with OSA.
• Central apnea syndrome: the majority of apneic events are central in
origin (50%–80%)
Clinical features
• Insomnia with difficulty falling asleep and frequent awakenings
• Restless unrefreshing sleep
• Two major groups
• With hypoventilation during the day (hypercapnic): includes patients
with a defect in ventilatory control and with neuromuscular
disorders
• Without hypoventilation during the day (nonhypercapnic): patients
with Cheyne-Stokes breathing and patients in whom no obvious
cause for the CSA exists
• Cheyne-Stokes breathing—crescendo-decrescendo periodic pattern
of breathing seen in patients with congestive heart failure, most
prominent during lighter stages of NREM sleep, associated with central
apneas or central hypopneas at the nadir; arousals tend to occur at the
maximum point of respiratory effort
• Cardiac and neurological work-ups are recommended in patients with
CSA.
Treatment
• Nasal CPAP may be useful in CSA associated with upper airway
obstruction and congestive heart failure.
• BiPAP often shows greater benefit, as it produces higher pressure
during inspiration than expiration; thus, the pressure difference may
stimulate inspiratory efforts and improve the response.
• Supplemental oxygen
• Acetazolamide (Diamox) reduces the respiratory alkalosis and
hypocapnia that can trigger central apneas by inhibiting carbonic
anhydrase, thereby facilitating bicarbonate diuresis.

Hypersomnias not due to breathing
disorders
Narcolepsy
Narcolepsy is a neurological disorder characterized by excessive daytime
sleepiness, cataplexy (loss of muscle strength, often with falling, during
periods of high emotion such as laughter), hypnagogic hallucinations (vivid
dreams at sleep onset), sleep paralysis (loss of muscle strength at sleep
onset or upon awakening).

HYPERSOMNIAS NOT DUE TO BREATHING DISORDERS

Epidemiology
• Prevalence is estimated between 2 and 10 per 10,000 in the white
populations of North America and Europe.
• Most common age of onset is between 12 and 30 years, with a second
peak around 40 years; in 70%–80% of cases symptoms begin before age
25 years.
• Men and women equally affected
Genetics and pathophysiology
• HLA DQB1*0602 and HLA DQA1*0102 are narcolepsy susceptibility
genes.
• Most cases are sporadic.
• Loss of hypocretin-orexin (secreted by the lateral hypothalamus,
important in maintaining wakefulness) with consequent stimulation
of the locus ceruleus may be important for the manifestations of
narcolepsy; absence of hypocretin-orexin-secreting neurons has been
demonstrated in brains from patients with narcolepsy.
Clinical features
• Excessive daytime sleepiness—usually the first symptom and most
troublesome; inability to obtain relief with any amount of sleep
• Sleep attacks—sudden periods of irresistible daytime sleepiness;
episodes occur during daytime, without warning; usually brief
• Cataplexy—brief episodes of bilateral weakness brought on by high
emotions (laughter, anger, excitement, surprise, shock); a symptom
specific for narcolepsy, but only occurs in about 70% of cases; no
associated altered consciousness
• Sleep paralysis—inability to move while still awake at sleep onset
(hypnagogic) or on awakening (hypnopompic)
• Hypnagogic and hypnopompic hallucinations—frightening illusions or
hallucinations; may include visual imagery or auditory hallucinations
• Nocturnal sleep disruption—sleep fragmentation
• Primary narcolepsy—normal neurologic examination
• Secondary narcolepsy—may occur in patients with multiple sclerosis,
stroke, head trauma, brain tumors, CNS infections

Diagnostic evaluation
• History of daytime sleepiness (daily lapses into sleep for at least
3 months) and unequivocal cataplexy
• Nocturnal sleep study (polysomnography, PSG) and multiple sleep
latency test (MSLT), to rule out other sleep disorders and demonstrate
either short nocturnal REM latency (<20 minutes) on PSG or a mean
sleep latency less than 5 minutes and two or more naps with sleeponset REM periods (SOREMPs) on the MSLT
Treatment
• Symptom oriented
• Sleepiness—pharmacologic-stimulant drugs: Modafinil (Provigil),
Methylphenidate (Ritalin), amphetamines

277

278

CHAPTER 10

Sleep disorders

• Nonpharmacologic—good sleep hygiene, adequate sleep, daytime naps
• Cataplexy—serotonin reuptake blockers (Fluoxetine), tricyclic
antidepressants (Imipramine, Clomipramine), Carbamazepine
(Tegretol), Gamma-hydroxybutyrate (Sodium Oxybate, Xyren)

Recurrent hypersomnia (Kleine-Levin Syndrome)
A rare syndrome characterized by the following:
• Recurrent episodes of prolonged sleep associated with hyperphagia
• Episodes may last up to several weeks and recur at irregular intervals
of approximately several months.
• Disorientation, automatic behavior, sexual disinhibition, depression,
hallucinations (visual or auditory), irritability, aggression often
accompany the episodes of hypersomnia
• More common in boys than girls (ratio 4:1)
• Onset is typically during adolescence.
• Episodes improve in frequency and severity with age.
Treatment
• Symptomatic treatment with stimulants may offer limited benefit.
• Lithium or carbamazepine may reduce the frequency of subsequent
episodes.

Idiopathic hypersomnia
Clinical features
• Excessive daytime sleepiness despite adequate sleep and excluding
disorders that cause daytime sleepiness (narcolepsy, obstructive sleep
apnea, periodic limb movement disorder)
• No associated REM abnormalities or cataplexy
• Often begins in adolescence
• Some patients report difficulty waking with/without disorientation
(“sleep drunkenness”).
• Naps are not refreshing.
• PSG shows normal or increased amount of sleep; however, REM
latency is not decreased.
• MSLT reveals excessive daytime sleepiness, with a mean sleep latency
of 10 minutes, but less than two SOREMPs in five naps.
Treatment
Stimulant medications offer limited benefit; patients are encouraged to
maintain a regular sleep–wake schedule and avoid reductions in sleep
time.

Parasomnias
Parasomnias are a group of disorders characterized by undesirable physical
and mental phenomena that occur mainly or exclusively during sleep.

Classification
• Disorders of arousal: confusional arousals, sleepwalking, sleep terrors
• Sleep–wake transition disorders: sleep talking, rhythmic movement
disorder, nocturnal leg cramps

PARASOMNIAS

• Parasomnias usually associated with REM sleep: REM sleep behavior
disorder, nightmares, sleep paralysis
• Other parasomnias, with no clear relationship to a particular stage of
sleep: sleep bruxism, nocturnal paroxysmal dystonia

Arousal disorders
Clinical features
• More common in children
• Events occur as partial arousals from slow-wave sleep (deeper stages
of NREM sleep).
• Patients have no recollection of the events.
• Tend to improve with age
Treatment
• Sleep hygiene with maintaining regular sleep habits; avoiding sleep
deprivation is recommended for confusional arousals
• Short course, up to 6 months, of a low dose of benzodiazepine, is
beneficial for patients with sleepwalking and excessively disruptive
behavior.

Confusional arousals
• Sudden arousal from sleep associated with disorientation and complex
behaviors but low levels of motor, emotional, autonomic activation
• Episodes last seconds to minutes, occasionally up to 10 minutes or
more
• Most common during first third of the night
Sleepwalking
• Complex automatisms during sleep classically associated with getting
out of bed and walking, leave or attempt to leave home, opening and
closing doors, climbing stairs, preparing food
• More complex motor activity but little autonomic or emotional
activation
• Episodes may last a few minutes up to 30 minutes.
• Injury during the episode is the most serious complication.
• Occasionally violent behaviors may accompany the complex activity,
sometimes directed at the person trying to awaken the sleepwalker.
Sleep terrors
• Pronounced autonomic and emotional activation and varying degrees
of motor activity
• Episodes arise abruptly from sleep with agitation and apparent fear
or terror; patient is unresponsive or only partially responsive and
inconsolable.
• Prototypical episodes start with screaming and agitated behavior.
• Events are common among children aged 4 to 10 years; occur out of
slow-wave sleep during first third of the night.
Sleep–wake transition disorders
• Occur during transitions between sleep and wakefulness
• Usually occur in otherwise healthy persons; are considered normal
events unless their frequency or severity leads to anxiety, injuries

279

280

CHAPTER 10

Sleep disorders

• Rhythmic movement disorder—also called head banging, head rolling,
body rocking, is most common in infants and less common by age 4
years; tends to be more common in patients with mental retardation
• Sleeptalking—vast majority of episodes occur during arousals from
NREM sleep; is common with REM behavior disorder
• Leg cramps are common in elderly and consist of a painful muscle
contraction that involves the calf or foot and associated with bulging
and palpable tightness of the muscle.
• Predisposing factors include prior exercise, fluid and electrolyte
disturbances, pregnancy, diabetes mellitus, nicotine and caffeine use
• If treatment is indicated, quinine, vitamin E, verapamil ,or
procainamide may be effective

Parasomnias usually associated with REM sleep
REM sleep behavior disorder
• Clinical features
• Loss of the normal muscle REM sleep atonia associated with dream
enacting behavior
• Limb and body movements are often violent
• Since episodes occur during REM sleep they are more frequent
during the latter half of the night and usually last from a few
seconds to 20 to 30 minutes
• Serious injury to the patient or the bed partner has been described
• Primarily a disorder of older persons, often with onset of symptoms
after age 50 years
• Some patients with RBD later develop Parkinson disease
• PSG with video recording is useful in confirming the diagnosis
Treatment
• Clonazepam is effective in nearly 90% of cases
• Other options include imipramine, melatonin, diazepam, donepezil

Circadian rhythm sleep disorders
Clinical features
• Defined as disturbances in the natural rhythm of circadian functions
• The suprachiasmatic (SCN) nucleus of the hypothalamus is the major
source of circadian rhythmicity; it synchronizes body functions with the
environmental light–dark cycle.
• Melatonin, secreted by the pineal gland only during darkness,
synchronizes the SCN to the environment.
• Circadian cycles are approximately 1 day in duration.
• Numerous human physiologic functions have circadian rhythmicity,
including body temperature, sleep and wakefulness, plasma and urine
hormones, rest and activity.
• The rhythm of sleep and wakefulness is coupled to endogenous
pacemaker, such as the temperature rhythm; sleepiness is greatest
during early morning hours, when the core body temperature is at a

CIRCADIAN RHYTHM SLEEP DISORDERS

minimum and during the afternoon hours, when body temperature is
high.
• Disorders of the circadian sleep–wake cycle may be transient or
persistent.

Transient disorders
Jet lag syndrome
• Clinical features
• Arises from discordance between patient’s internal circadian
pacemaker and external clock time secondary to rapid travel across
several time zones
• Symptoms include difficulty falling asleep, difficulty maintaining sleep,
and excessive sleepiness during the new daytime.
• Symptoms tend to be more severe with eastbound flights, as
patients find it easier to delay the time of sleep onset.
• Tends to worsen with increasing age
• Treatment
• Options include behavioral and scheduling changes, timed daylight
exposure, short-acting hypnotics, melatonin
Shift-work sleep disorder
• Clinical features
• Night-shift and rotating-shift work often lead to sleep problems.
• Symptoms include daytime insomnia with short or disrupted
daytime sleep, sleepiness at work, and excessive sleepiness
commuting to and from work and while at work.
• Treatment
• A sleep schedule that allows patient to obtain restful sleep 7 days
or nights per week
• Melatonin may be helpful.
• Change to a permanent day shift may be required

Persistent disorders
Delayed-sleep-phase syndrome
• Timing of sleep onset is delayed relative to clock time, resulting in
waking up late in the morning
• Difficulty awakening and getting up in the morning is the usual
presenting complaint.
• Patients tend to fall asleep late, anytime between 1 am and 6 am.
• When sleep is undisturbed, the sleep period is of normal length.
• Chronotherapy (progressive delay in time of sleep onset) is the
traditional treatment.
• Bright light therapy and exercise in the morning may help.
Advanced-sleep-phase syndrome
• Characterized by early sleep onset (6 to 8 pm) and early morning wake
time (1 and 3 am)
• More frequent in the elderly
• Exacerbated by naps during the day and early morning walks
• Exposure to bright light and mild activity in the evening may delay the
bedtime

281

282

CHAPTER 10

Sleep disorders

Irregular sleep–wake pattern disorder
• Complaints of insomnia or excessive daytime sleepiness
• One or more sleep episodes in a 24-hour period
• Pattern must have been present for 3 months
• Personality disorder or blindness may be predisposing factors; often
patients have congenital, developmental, or degenerative brain
dysfunction
Non-24-hour sleep–wake disorder
• Internal pacemaker is not entrained to the 24-hour day–night cycle and
runs based on a shorter or longer period.
• Progressive delays in sleep and wake times
• Most individuals are blind, with loss of retinal input to the SCN as a
cause of the syndrome; absence of light input runs with a rhythm that is
longer than 24 hours (up to 27 hours).
• Management is difficult; strict 24-hour scheduling of sleep and awake
activities may have some benefit.

Sleep-related movement disorders
Restless legs syndrome (RLS)
Clinical features
• Paresthesias (abnormal sensations) and dysesthesias (uncomfortable
sensations) in the legs and sometimes the arms, worse at rest, in
the evening or at night, and associated with an urge to move (motor
restlessness)
• Mean age of onset is in the middle age
• Sleep disturbances: difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep, excessive
daytime sleepiness (less often)
• Involuntary movements during wake or sleep (periodic leg movements
in sleep, PLMS) in up to 80%–90% of patients
• Primary RLS: normal neurologic examination; possible abnormality
in iron transport into the CNS or in use of iron as it relates to
dopaminergic neurons
• Secondary RLS: end-stage renal failure, pregnancy, iron deficiency,
certain drugs
• Some familial cases are related to deficiencies in iron transporter
proteins.
Diagnostic evaluation
• Diagnosis is usually made on clinical grounds.
• Complete blood count, serum iron, total iron-binding capacity, serum
ferritin levels, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine should be checked to
rule out treatable causes

SLEEP-RELATED MOVEMENT DISORDERS

• PSG has limited value, as PLMs are common in persons without RLS,
and about 10%–20% of persons with RLS do not have PLMs.
Treatment
• Dopamine agonists: Ropinirole, Pramipexole, Pergolide, at smaller
doses than used for Parkinson disease
• Gabapentin—useful to treat the discomfort and movement at night
• Other anticonvulsant medications, such as Carbamazepine, Zonisamide,
Topiramate, and Benzodiazepines
• For patients with low serum iron, iron supplementation should be
considered.

Periodic limb movements of sleep (PLMS)
Clinical features
• Characterized as repetitive stereotyped dorsiflexions of the big toe
with fanning of the small toes, accompanied by flexion of the ankles,
knees and thighs that typically recur at intervals of 5–90 seconds with a
duration of 0.5–5 seconds
• Four movements must be counted per episode to meet the
polysomnographic criteria of PLMS
• Most common in NREM sleep, stages 1 and 2
• Periodic leg movement disorder (PLMD)
• Characterized by the syndrome of leg movements and insomnia or
excessive daytime sleepiness
• Severity of symptoms is related to the frequency of limb
movements and associated arousals or awakenings
• Associated with uremia, peripheral vascular disease, anemia,
arthritis, peripheral neuropathy, spinal cord lesions, caffeine use,
antidepressants
• Many patients with PLMS do not have RLS.
Diagnostic evaluation
• PLM index is the number of leg movements per hour.
• PLM index must be >5/hr; for a leg movement to be counted as a PLM,
it must occur in a sequence of at least four leg movements separated
by 5–90 seconds.
• PLMD consists of PLMS and symptoms of insomnia or daytime
sleepiness
• PLMS may be seen in association with narcolepsy, OSA, CPAP titration
Treatment
• Should be considered only if the PLMS and associated sleep
disturbance appear to be responsible
• Most helpful treatments for PLMs are those used for RLS

CHAPTER 11

Infectious and inflammatory conditions

Infectious disease: bacterial meningitis
Incidence and microbiology Annual incidence around 2–3/100,000 with
peaks in infants and adolescents. Vaccination against Haemophilus influenzae type b and group C meningococcus has had significant impact.

Common meningitides by age
• Newborns: Group B Streptococcus, Listeria monocytogenes, E. coli
• Infants (<6 months): Listeria, S. pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis,
Haemophilus influenzae type b
• Adolescence through middle age: S. pneumoniae, Neisseria, Haemophilus
• Elderly: S. pneumoniae, Neisseria, Listeria

Acquired risk factors
• Splenic dysfunction or splenectomy (Streptococcus pneumoniae)
• T lymphocyte defects due to chemotherapy, malignancy, HIV (Listeria
monocytogenes)
• Sickle cell disease (Staphylococcus)
• Skull fracture, middle and inner ear fistulas (S. pneumoniae)
• Penetrating skull trauma, CSF shunts (Staphylococcus)
• Mucosal epithelial damage, e.g., smoking, recent viral illness
• Consider tuberculous meningitis in those from endemic areas
• In the immunosuppressed, e.g., HIV—cryptococcal meningitis and
tuberculous meningitis
• Crowded living conditions, e.g., college dorms, military barracks
(Neisseria)

Clinical features
Presenting features typically with some combination of headache, fever,
photophobia, and neck stiffness. In addition:
• Cranial nerve palsies (III, IV, VI, VII)
• Focal neurological deficits
• Seizures (20%–30%). Usually in S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae
meningitis
• Increased ICP (altered consciousness level, hypertension, bradycardia,
abnormal respiratory pattern, papilledema [late])
• Purpura or petechial hemorrhages (nonblanching with glass test):
Neisseria meningitidis
• Septic shock: N. meningitidis
• Tuberculous meningitis may be more insidious with gradual
development of fever, weight loss, headache with progression to focal
deficit, altered consciousness
• Look for evidence of immunosuppression as may be the first
presentation of HIV or lymphoproliferative disorder, e.g., oral
candidiasis, lymphadenopathy

INFECTIOUS DISEASE: BACTERIAL MENINGITIS

Investigations
1. Blood culture as latex agglutination bacterial antigen tests or PCR can
be performed and may remain positive even after antibiotics.
2. CXR for evidence of TB
3. CT scan does not exclude raised ICP. Often normal in appearance.
Occasionally with mild ventricular dilatation or widening of
subarachnoid space
4. Lumbar puncture (best obtained prior to or within 4 hours of starting
antibiotic therapy) is contraindicated if
• Signs of increased ICP
• Decreased Glasgow Coma Scale
• Coagulopathy (increased PT/INR or PTT, platelets<50,000)
• Focal symptoms, signs or seizures (unless CT scan normal)
• Cardiovascular compromise (medical instability)
• Infection of skin at LP site
5. See Table 11.1 for lumbar puncture and blood findings in different
forms of meningitis
6. MRI findings commonly include meningeal enhancement and enhancing
subarachnoid exudates deep in sulci (see Fig. 11.1).

Management
Choice of antibiotic
Choice of antibiotic depends on age of patient and any other associated
features, e.g., immunocompromised. CT or LP should not delay first dose of
antibiotic.
In adults likely organisms are as follows:
• Streptococcus pneumoniae
• Neisseria meningitides
• If >60 years, Listeria monocytogenes

CHAPTER 11

Infectious and inflammatory conditions

Therapy after identification by class of bacteria or specific organism from CSF
or blood. (See Table 11.2 for dosage recommendation.)
• Gram or AFB stain
• Gram-positive cocci: ceftriaxone (or cefotaxime) PLUS vancomycin
• Gram-negative cocci: Penicillin G or if H. influenzae suspected (small
pleomorphic rods), ceftriaxone (or cefotaxime)
• Gram-positive bacilli: ampicillin PLUS gentamicin
• Gram-negative bacilli: ceftriaxone (or cefotaxime) PLUS gentamicin
(Note: ceftazidime is preferred in place of ceftriaxone if recent
neurosurgical procedure or head trauma)
• AFB-positive: Start 4 drug regimen for tuberculosis. Place patient in
negative pressure respiratory isolation room. Assess for pulmonary
and/or disseminated disease
• Cultured organism
• N. meningitidis
• Ceftriaxone (or cefotaxime)
• S. pneumoniae
• Ceftriaxone (or cefotaxime)
• Add vancomycin if patient from area of cephalosporin/penicillin
resistance
• H. influenzae: ceftriaxone (or cefotaxime) if beta-lactamase positive;
ampicillin if beta-lactamase negative
• L. monocytogenes: ampicillin + gentamicin
• Group B Streptococcus: Penicillin G
• E. coli and Enterobacteriaceae in general: ceftriaxone (or cefotaxime)
PLUS gentamicin
• Enterococcus: ampicillin PLUS gentamicin; if ampicillin resistant, then
vancomycin PLUS gentamicin; if vancomycin and ampicillin resistant,
then linezolid
• Staph aureus: if methicillin sensitive, then nafcillin or oxacillin; if
methicillin resistant, then vancomycin
• Staph epidermidis: vancomycin
• Pseudomonas or Acetinobacter: ceftazidime PLUS gentamicin
• Tuberculosis meningitis: 4-drug therapy (isoniazid, rifampin,
pyrazinamide, ethambutol). Note: Pyridoxine given prophylactically
(25–100 mg daily) can minimize risk of peripheral neuropathy due to
isoniazid
Increased ICP
• A medical emergency. Patient should be managed in ICU. Interventions
may include elevation of head of bed to 30 degrees, neutral head
position, IV mannitol administration, sedation, intubation and
hyperventilation, placement of ventriculostomy, and controlled
hypothermia.
Seizures
• Should be treated initially with lorazepam 0.1 mg/kg IV (in divided
doses, usually starting with 2 mg), followed by IV phenytoin 20 mg/kg as
a loading dose under ECG monitoring followed by maintenance dose
IV of 5 mg/kg/day. If seizures continue, treat as for status epilepticus.

BACTERIAL INFECTIONS AND TOXINS

Corticosteroids (dexamethasone)
• Shown to reduce morbidity in adults specifically in S. pneumoniae and
tuberculous meningitis. Data do not include meningococcal meningitis,
but it is reasonable to consider at least until organism isolated—10 mg
dexamethasone 6-hourly IV for 4 days with first dose given prior to or
with first antibiotic dose
• Shown to reduce morbidity (hearing loss and focal neurological
deficits) in children, specifically in those with H. influenzae type b. Data
are unclear as to whether there may also be benefit in children with
pneumococcal meningitis. If used, the first dose of dexamethasone
(0.15 mg/kg q6hr over 2–4 days) must be given prior to or at the same
time as administration of first dose of antibiotics; delay by even 1 hour
results in lost benefit.

Bacterial infections and toxins
Subdural infections
• Relatively rare infection with collections of pus between dura and
arachnoid meningeal layers
• Direct extension of infection from meninges, sinuses, middle ear or as
complication of skull fracture
• Streptococcus is the most frequent organism.
• Symptoms include focal neurological deficits, meningismus, chills, fever,
headache, and confusion evolving over hours to days.
• Avoid lumbar puncture due to risk of herniation; if done, findings
include increased ICP, mild pleocytosis (polymorph or lymphocyte
predominant), increased protein, sterile CSF
• Treatment
• Surgical evacuation of empyema
• Antibiotics appropriate to suspected or cultured organism

Epidural infections
Intracranial epidural abscess
• Associated with infection in overlying cranial bones
• Extension of infection from sinuses, mastoid space, middle ear,
meninges, or as a result of septicemia
• Streptococcus most common pathogen (Staphylococcus and gramnegative bacteria also isolated frequently)
• Patient appears ill with headache and fever, but rarely has focal
neurological findings
• Diagnosis by CT or MRI
• Treatment
• Surgical evacuation of empyema
• Antibiotics appropriate to suspected or cultured organism
Spinal epidural abscess
• Three routes of infection:
• Direct extension of infection from adjacent tissues

and by PCR or electron microscopy to demonstrate presence of the
organism
• Treatment: ceftriaxone (2 gm IV bid) for 14–30 days, then Bactrim
DS (160/800 mg po bid) or cefixime (400 mg daily) for 1 year; other
agents. Tetracycline and penicillin have also been used with success.
Leprosy (Mycobacterium leprae)
• Common in tropical and subtropical areas
• Transmitted by direct contact
• Tuberculoid (paucibacillary) and lepromatous (multibacillary) forms
• Predilection for peripheral nerves resulting in thickened nerves with
overgrowth of connective tissue and axonal loss—most common with
tuberculoid form
• Attacks of neuropathic pain, weakness, or sensory loss
• Nerves closest to the skin surface (coolest nerves) are preferentially
affected
• Weakness and atrophy seen most commonly in hand
and foot intrinsic muscles; deep nerves and proximal
muscles spared
• Cutaneous sensory loss prominent with preservation of deeper
sensory structures
• Beware false-positive test for syphilis—seen in one third
• Treatment with dapsone (50–100 mg daily) and rifampin (600 mg
monthly) for tuberculoid form: dapsone and rifampin and clofazimine
(50 mg daily) for lepromatous form
Rickettsial infections: Rocky Mountain spotted fever, typhus (three types),
Ehrlichiosis

295

296

CHAPTER 11

Infectious and inflammatory conditions

Mycoplasma infection (Mycoplasma pneumoniae)
• Major cause of pneumonia
• Transmitted by inhalation
• Less often can be associated with meningitis, encephalitis, cerebellar
ataxia, transverse myelitis, radiculopathies, cranial nerve palsies
• Treatment: doxycycline or erythromycin
Legionella pneumophila
• Pneumonia most common
• Transmitted by inhalation
• Uncommon neurological symptoms may include encephalitis, cerebellar
ataxia, chorea, and peripheral neuropathy
• Treatment: azithromycin or erythromycin

Bacterial toxins
Diphtheria (Corynebacterium diphtheriae)
• Exotoxin has tropism for peripheral nerve with demyelinating
peripheral neuropathy manifested in 20% of patients
• Also tropism for cardiac muscle resulting in myocarditis
• Descending paralysis:
• Impaired visual accommodation, then
• Ocular and oropharyngeal muscle paresis, then
• Limb weakness that may progress to quadriparesis
Botulism (Clostridia botulinum)— botulinum toxin
• Ingestion of toxin-contaminated food (adults); ingestion of
bacteria (infants) with subsequent toxin production; wound
contamination
• Toxin absorbed from GI tract (or wound), then spread
hematogenously; symptoms occur 6–48 hours after ingestion—or later
in case of infants where bacteria grow in digestive tract and produce
toxin
• Toxin impairs release of acetylcholine at peripheral presynaptic nerve
ending through interference with fusion of presynaptic acetylcholinecontaining vesicles
• Descending weakness of striated and smooth muscles
• Autonomic dysfunction
• Typical presentation (with symptom progression):
• Possible nausea, vomiting, diarrhea (not always present)
• Loss of convergence of eyes
• Ptosis, ophthalmoplegia, dilated or unreactive pupils
• Dysphagia, dysarthria
• Weakness of limbs in descending pattern
• Constipation and urinary retention may be present
• If undiagnosed, convulsions and coma with cardiac or respiratory
failure may result (within 4–8 days, if large amount of toxin
ingested)

VIRAL MENINGOENCEPHALITIS

• Diagnosis
• History, clinical suspicion
• Testing of contaminated food or feces of patient for toxin
• Nerve conduction studies supportive
• Treatment
• Botulinum antitoxin
• Supportive care
Tetanus (Clostridia tetani)—tetanospasmin toxin
• Bacterial spores ubiquitous in environment and enter body through
disrupted skin barrier (puncture or wound)
• Necrotic tissue required for germination of spores and subsequent
production of toxin, which is spread hematogenously
• Toxin impairs release of acetylcholine at presynaptic nerve ending
through interference with fusion of presynaptic vesicles
• Tropism for inhibitory neurons in CNS, resulting in decreased
release of GABA and glycine l central hyperexcitability
• Can affect autonomic function
• Central effects predominate over peripheral effects
• Symptoms present from 3 days to 3 weeks after injection
• Generalized tetanus
• Facial muscle stiffness: trismus, risus sardonicus,
• Muscle stiffness and rigidity of back (opisthotonos)
• Paroxysmal muscle spasms with minimal or no trigger
• Localized tetanus
• Rare—seen in previously immunized persons
• Muscle stiffness and spasms limited to area of entry of spores
• Diagnosis
• Characteristic signs and history of wound
• Treatment
• Debride wound
• Antitoxin to neutralize toxin not yet bound to nerves
• Supportive care in ICU—may require respiratory support,
benzodiazepines, or neuromuscular blockade

Viral meningoencephalitis
Infection of the brain parenchyma is usually accompanied by a meningitis producing a meningoencephalitis. The organism is identified in only
30%–50% of cases.

Incidence
• Herpes simplex encephalitis (HSV-1), most frequent cause of
sporadic fatal encephalitis: 1 case per million per year probably
an underestimate. Currently the only pharmacologically treatable
encephalitide
• In the Far East, Japanese B encephalitis causes 15,000 deaths/year.

•

Borrelia burgdorferi
Brucellosis
Leptospirosis
Legionella
All causes of pyogenic meningitis
Fungal: cryptococcus, aspergillosis, candidiasis
Parasitic: human African trypanosomiasis, toxoplasmosis,
schistosomiasis
• Acute disseminated encephalitis (ADEM) May have a similar
presentation but clues include recent vaccination, spinal cord and optic
nerve involvement, and widespread white matter involvement on MRI.

Investigations
• Routine blood investigations may reveal a metabolic etiology
• CXR to exclude TB, legionella, mycoplasma, and neoplasia
• Baseline virology serology may later provide evidence of recent
infection
• CT/MRI: gyral swelling and signal abnormality/low attenuation, which is
typically bilateral but asymmetric with hemorrhage
EEG
• Emergency EEG may be necessary to make diagnosis. Look for
diffuse nonspecific abnormalities or periodic lateralizing epileptiform
discharges (PLEDS)
• In H. simplex encephalitis PLEDS may be bilateral and evolve with
differing periodicity over each lobe.
• If PLEDS occur away from the temporal lobe, interpret with caution.
• May improve spontaneously and rapidly
LP
• Lymphocytic pleocytosis 10–200/mm3
• Protein, 0.6–6 g/L
• Rarely, the CSF may be normal.
• CSF PCR to detect HSV-1 is 95% specific. Sensitivity if taken 2–10 days
after onset is 95%. False-negative results are most likely in the first 48
hours and after 10 days.

Management
• Acyclovir (10 mg/kg q8hr) immediately when diagnosis is suspected.
Continue for 14 days. It should only be discontinued if an alternative
definite diagnosis is made. In immunosuppressed patients, treat for 21
days. Note: Renal toxicity may occur and needs to be monitored. Five
percent of patients may relapse.
• Best predictors of outcome are treatment within 4 days of onset,
Glasgow Coma Scale >6 at presentation
• Steroids if there is evidence of raised ICP
• Anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) for seizures
• May need cardiac /ICU monitoring

HIGHLIGHT ON WEST NILE VIRUS

Highlight on West Nile virus
• An arbovirus widely distributed worldwide with recently increasing
outbreaks in the United States
• Peak disease incidence in late summer and fall with sporadic cases
throughout the year, especially in southern climates
• Transmission primarily by mosquito bites; amplification of virus in birds
• Transmission also reported through blood transfusion, organ donation,
transplacental, and through breast milk

Clinical manifestations
• Asymptomatic in up to 80%
• Self-limited febrile illness—West Nile fever
• Fatigue, fever, headache, myalgias, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea
• Maculopapular rash on back, chest, and arms in 50%
• 3–10-day course
• Neuroinvasive disease
• Meningoencephalitis—seizures common
• Flaccid paralysis resembling poliomyelitis (affecting anterior horn
cells)—can be asymmetric
• Acute peripheral demyelinating syndrome (rare)
• Tremor and myoclonus
• Parkinsonian symptoms
• Cranial nerve palsies and brachial plexopathy
• Ataxia
• Optic neuritis

Laboratory findings
• CBC: normal or elevated WBC
• LP: pleocytosis with lymphocytic predominance and elevated protein
• Imaging
• CT: usually normal
• MRI: may show enhancement of meninges and/or periventricular
areas; hyperintensities in deep gray matter, brainstem, or spinal cord
initially or developing within weeks
• EEG: generalized slowing, predominantly in frontotemporal region
• EMG (in acute flaccid paralysis): NCS with preserved sensory
responses, decreased amplitude motor responses

Diagnosis
• IgM antibody detection by enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay
(ELISA) – Serum or CSF
• IgM antibody may not be detected within first week of infection—
repeat ELISA if clinical suspicion high
• Beware of false positives in persons with recent vaccinations

Treatment
• Supportive

CHAPTER 11

Infectious and inflammatory conditions

Neurology of HIV/AIDS: introduction
• HIV infection can affect the whole neuraxis at all stages of the illness.
• Different pathological processes can be present simultaneously.

Basic principles
• Ten percent of patients may have a neurological disorder at
seroconversion
• Meningoencephalitis
• Myelitis
• Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS)
• Polymyositis
• Persistent CSF abnormalities, even during the asymptomatic phase,
include
• Mild pleocytosis
• Increased protein
• Oligoclonal bands
• To diagnose conditions such as cryptococcal meningitis, specific tests
such as the cryptococcal antigen test are required.
• Decreased inflammatory response: one-third of patients with
cryptococcal meningitis have meningismus
• Low threshold for brain imaging and lumbar puncture required
• Decreased antibody response: in toxoplasmosis, there is no rise in IgM
levels
• CD4 count is a useful guide to the underlying pathological process
• Toxoplasmosis, cryptococcal meningitis, progressive multifocal
leukoencephalopathy occur at CD4 counts < 200
• CMV disease occurs at CD4 counts < 50

Neurological disorders due to HIV
HIV-associated dementia (HAD)
• Usually occurs late in the disease
• Symptoms include impaired attention, memory loss, and apathy.
• Signs in the early stages include jerky eye movements, brisk reflexes,
and cerebellar abnormalities.
• Differential diagnoses include metabolic derangement, e.g., hypoxia,
recreational drug use, and depression.
Investigations to exclude other pathology
• MRI shows atrophy and diffuse white matter changes (see Fig. 11.3).
• CSF examination (nonspecific cytochemical abnormalities)
• CSF HIV RNA load cannot be used to diagnose HAD.
• Neuropsychological assessment useful—subcortical dementia with
abnormalities in the domains of information processing, psychomotor
speed, and recall memory

Vacuolar myelopathy (VM)
• Occurs in conjunction with HIV dementia

NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS DUE TO HIV

Figure 11.3 HIV encephalopathy (T2-weighted axial MRI) in young patient (20s).
Bilateral hyperintensity involving the cerebral white matter in association with
volume loss denoted by prominence of the cerebral sulci.

• Signs of a spastic paraparesis without a sensory level
• Resembles subacute combined degeneration due to vitamin B12
deficiency
• MRI usually normal
• Check B12 level and, if low normal, methylmalonic acid levels. If low,
treat with B12 as monthly intramuscular injection
• Consider checking indicated HTLV-1 serology as co-infection may
occur

Peripheral nerve syndromes
Distal sensory peripheral neuropathy (DSPN)
• Twenty-five percent of AIDS patients
• Occurs late in AIDS
• Symptoms of paresthesias, burning pain, dysesthesias
• Signs: little or no weakness, reduced or absent ankle reflexes. Impaired
sensation to pain and temperature (mainly a small-fiber neuropathy)
• Neuropathy due to antiretroviral drugs (e.g., ddC, ddI, d4T) is very
similar.
• Other drugs that may also cause neuropathy include isoniazid,
vincristine, thalidomide, and metronidazole.

lymphoma
Other peripheral nerve syndromes
• Mononeuritis multiplex due to HIV vasculitis and CMV
• Acute and chronic demyelinating polyneuropathy
• Diffuse inflammatory lymphocytosis syndrome (DILS) resembles

Fig. 11.4)
• Differential diagnoses: primary CNS lymphoma, tuberculoma, or
tuberculous abscesses
• Treatment: see Table 11.5

Figure 11.5 Algorithm for the management of mass lesions (CD4 count less than

200/mm3) as detected on CT/MRI (MRI is preferred as more sensitive). If increased
ICP, treat with dexamethasone 4 mg q6hr. Once improved, gradually taper. Benefit
may be due to decreased edema or response if lymphoma. At least 2 weeks may
be necessary to assess for a response to anti-toxoplasmosis therapy. In some cases,
providing there is no urgency, one may need to wait 1 month.

• Serum cryptococcal antigen measurement may be a useful screening
method in those with mild nonspecific symptoms
• Poor prognostic markers
• Altered mental state
• CSF OP >20 cmH2O
• CSF white cell count <10
• Hyponatremia
• Relapse episode
Treatment (See Table 11.5.)
• In mild cases where none of the poor prognostic markers are present,
fluconazole is an alternative drug to amphotericin.

FUNGAL INFECTIONS

• May require repeated LPs for raised ICP. Consider insertion of a
lumbar peritoneal shunt if frequent LPs required
• Acetazolamide may have an adjunctive role
• Acute phase Rx 4–6 weeks or until CSF culture negative

Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML)
• Caused by reactivation of JC virus, a polyoma virus
• Subacute presentation with focal signs with no evidence of increased
ICP
• Imaging
• MRI shows nonenhancing focal white matter lesions with little or no
mass effect on T2-weighted images
• T1-weighted images show discrete low signal changes
• CSF: JC virus detected by PCR in 75%. Specificity 99%
• Blood serology unhelpful since 80% of the general population
seropositive due to a childhood upper respiratory tract infection
Treatment
• HAART (highly active antiretroviral therapy) by improving immune
function
• Cidofovir has anti-JC viral activity. Mixed reports when combined with
HAART. Toxic side effects: nephrotoxicity, ocular hypotension
• Alpha interferon shown to have some benefit in one pre-HAART,
open-labeled study

CMV infection

•
•

May cause a meningoencephalitis
Lumbar polyradiculopathy
Retinitis
Diagnosis: neutrophil pleocytosis in the CSF; CMV isolation in the CSF

• Treatment with ganciclovir or foscarnet

Fungal infections
Life cycle
• Fungi live as soil-dwelling saprophytes, producing reproductive spores.
• Fungal spores may adapt to higher temperature of human body and
germinate.
• Pathogenic fungi can overwhelm or escape host defenses.
• Opportunistic fungi require impaired immune system for spores to
germinate.

Pathogenesis
• Pathogenic—can infect healthy person though more common in the
immunocompromised
• Histoplasma
• Blastomyces
• Coccidiodes

CHAPTER 11

Infectious and inflammatory conditions

• Paracoccidiodis
• Opportunistic—usually only seen in the immunocompromised patient
• Aspergillosis—up to 95% mortality with CNS invasion
• Candida
• Cryptococcus: common in AIDS population—can be fatal within
months
• Rhizopus (extension from nasal sinuses and eye to brain;
predisposition to infection in diabetic patients and leukemic
patients)
• Nocardia

Clinical features
• Meningitis or meningoencephalitis
• Abscess
• Arterial thrombosis

Diagnosis
•
•
•
•
•

Can be difficult
Clinical suspicion necessary
Characteristic imaging
Serum and CSF antigen and antibodies
Demonstration of organism in tissue

Treatment
• Amphotericin B for most CNS fungal infections, may also consider
flucytosine, -azoles, and caspofungin
• Specific treatments
• Actinomycosis: penicillin or tetracycline
• Nocardia: sulfa drugs

Parasitic infections
Parasitic infections have been uncommon in developed countries but are
increasing in prevalence with immigration of persons from less-developed
countries and with increased survival of immunocompromised patients.
• The two major categories of parasitic infections are represented by the
helminths (worms) and protozoans (single-celled organisms).
• Helminths—multi-celled organisms that elicit allergic reactions
(eosinophilia); focal lesional involvement of the CNS; a diffuse
meningitis may be present as well; seizures are common. Infections
acquired by ingestion or injection of immature forms of life cycle.
Animal hosts involved in life cycles
• Tapeworms: Taenia, Echinococcus
• Trematodes: Schistosoma, Strongyloides, Paragonimus
• Nematode: Angiostrongylus, Trichinella, Toxocara
• Protozoans—single-celled organisms; do not elicit allergic
reactions or eosinophilia; diffuse involvement of the CNS with
meningoencephalitis

PRION DISEASES

• Toxoplasma (toxoplasmosis): prevalent in AIDS patient population
• Plasmodium (cerebral malaria): most common human parasitic
disease; CNS involvement in 2%
• Trypanosoma (sleeping sickness and Chagas disease): African and
South American diseases, respectively; arthropod-borne diseases
• Amebic infection: Naegleria (encountered in fresh water—invades
CNS through olfactory epithelium—fatal) and Acanthamoeba
(opportunistic—invades through lungs—fatal)

Prion diseases
Prions are abnormal proteins that cause a progressive spongiform encephalopathy and are transmissible. A prion induces a conformational change
in normal proteins to an abnormal pathogenic form. The particular protein involved in disease in humans has been localized to the short arm of
chromosome 20 (codon 129). A normal cellular isoform of protein (PRPc)
exists; its function is unknown. The pathogenic form (PrPsc) occurs sporadically, as a genetic mutation, or is acquired (transmitted) from exposure
to the abnormal protein through ingestion, transplantation of infected tissue, and injection by contaminated surgical instruments. All forms of prion
disease are without treatment and uniformly fatal.

Kuru
• First human prion disease to be recognized
• Among natives of New Guinea who practice cannibalism
• Neuropathology—brain
• Neuronal vacuolization and loss
• Astrocytic vacuolization and proliferation
• Amyloid plaques throughout, prominent in cerebellum
• Clinical features
• Severe truncal and limb ataxia
• Involuntary movements
• Dementia
• Death within 4–24 months of symptoms

Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease
CJD is a human transmissible spongiform encephalopathy. Prion protein
(PrP) gene contains a polymorphic locus at codon 129 encoding methionine or valine. Important in determining susceptibility to sporadic and
acquired forms.
• Sporadic CJD, 85%–90% cases
• Familial forms, 10%–15% cases
• Familial CJD
• Gerstmann–Straussler–Scheinker
• Fatal familial insomnia
• Iatrogenic CJD (human pituitary derivatives, dura mater, and corneal
grafts), 1%
• Variant CJD: acquired by ingestion of contaminated meat

Differential diagnosis
• AD
• Cerebral vasculopathy—inflammatory, lymphoma
• Chronic encephalitis—Hashimoto encephalitis, SSPE
• Paraneoplastic encephalitis
• Demyelinating disorders

Variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD)
vCJD is the human form of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE).
Dietary transmission by ingestion of cow products is the most likely
source.
Epidemiology: Patients affected: typically 14–50 years though older patients
have been reported. All homozygous MM at codon 129.
Pathology: Florid amyloid plaques in cerebrum and cerebellum; spongiform
change in caudate and putamen; accumulation of abnormal PrP demonstrated by immunocytochemistry. There is widespread accumulation of
abnormal PrP in lymphoid tissue (tonsils and spleen).
Clinical features (early)
• Psychiatric symptoms
• Depression
• Withdrawal
• Aggression and irritability
• Anxiety, fear
• Hallucinations and delusions
• Sensory symptoms (thalamic)
• Limb pain
• Paresthesias and dysesthesias
• Numbness
• Cold or burning sensations
Later features
• Ataxia
• Movement disorders—myoclonus, choreiform movements, dystonia
• Cognitive impairment
Progression is less rapid than for sCJD—mean duration 14 months.
Differential diagnosis
• Wilson disease (copper, ceruloplasmin levels, 24 hour urinary copper,
and slit lamp exam for Kayser–Fleischer rings)
• AD
• Cerebral vasculitis
• Vitamin B12 deficiency
• Infective encephalitis
• Paraneoplastic syndrome
Investigations
• MRI: bilateral, symmetrical high signal in the posterior thalamus
(“pulvinar sign”; see Fig. 11.6B)
• EEG: normal or nonspecifically abnormal. Triphasic complexes not seen

MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS: INTRODUCTION AND CLINICAL FEATURES

• CSF: normal WCC; protein mild–moderate elevation. 14–3-3 increased
in 50%. Less sensitive than for sCJD
• PrP gene codon 129 status
• Tonsil biopsy may be considered but is not routine. A positive tonsillar
biopsy does not make a diagnosis of “definite vCJD.”
• Brain biopsy only if there is a possibility of a treatable disorder that
cannot be diagnosed by other methods, e.g., vasculitis
Management
• Supportive and palliative
• vCJD is not transmissible by ordinary contact or body fluids, but
invasive procedures require specific precautions.

Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker disease (GSS)
• Autosomal dominant familial prion disease
• Variable onset of symptoms (20s to 70s)
• Clinical course
• Ataxia followed by dementia over 2 to 10 years
• Brainstem involvement
• Degeneration of spinocerebellar and corticospinal tracts
• Widespread amyloid deposition
• Labs/imaging/neurophysiology
• CSF: normal (no 14–3-3 protein)
• MRI: generalized atrophy
• EEG: diffuse slowing

Fatal familial insomnia (FFI)
• Autosomal dominant familial prion disease
• Wide range of onset of symptoms (18–61 years)
• Clinical symptoms
• Progressive insomnia and dysautonomia
• Pyramidal and cerebellar signs
• Dementia
• Lab/imaging/neurophysiology
• MRI usually normal
• Labs usually normal
• On autopsy, neuronal loss and gliosis in thalamus with little or no
spongiform findings. With protracted course, neuronal loss also seen
on more widespread basis

Multiple sclerosis: introduction and
clinical features
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory demyelinating disorder of the
CNS defined by episodes of demyelination disseminated in time and neuroanatomical location.

Epidemiology
• In the US, 250,000 individuals affected

313

314

CHAPTER 11

Infectious and inflammatory conditions

• Prevalence 100/100,000 in United States
• Female:male ratio ~2:1; females with onset of disease 5 years earlier
than males on average
• Rare before puberty and after the age of 60 years
• Peak incidence in 20s and 30s
• Incidence higher with increasing latitude
• Geographic and racial variation in prevalence worldwide

Pathogenesis
• Not fully elucidated, but thought to be an autoimmune inflammatory
disorder with primary feature of T cells autoreactive to myelin in the
CNS
• Inflammation and blood–brain barrier disruption early in
demyelinating plaque formation
• TH1 activation
• Myelin reactive T cells
• Multiple pathways for tissue damage
• Primary axonal loss also occurs and is not clearly immune mediated
• Several histologically discrete types of plaques described
• An association with class II alleles of the major histocompatibiliity
complex (MHC) suggests genetic susceptibility triggered by an
environmental factor, e.g., chronic infection with EBV or HHV6

Disease patterns
• Relapsing-remitting—subacute evolution of symptoms over days;
symptoms reach a plateau and resolve completely or partially over
days or weeks; no progression of symptoms between relapses
• Relapsing progressive—characterized by episodes of new symptoms,
which may remit to some degree; however, there is slow progression of
symptoms between relapses
• Primary progressive—accumulation of deficits without remission from
onset of disease
• Secondary progressive—accumulation of deficits without remission
after a period (up to 9–10 years) of relapsing-remitting MS

Clinical features
• Transverse myelitis
• Weakness, sensory symptoms
• Urinary urgency and retention
• Flexor spasms
• Spastic quadri- or paraparesis
• Sensory level
• Brainstem
• Ataxia
• Diplopia
• Dysarthria
• Facial numbness
• Internuclear ophthalmoplegia
• Gaze palsy
• Rubral tremor

MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS: INTRODUCTION AND CLINICAL FEATURES

• Cerebellum
• Ataxia, dysarthria, nystagmus
• Optic neuritis: visual loss, painful eye movements, relative afferent
pupillary defect (RAPD), impaired color vision (tested with Ishihara
color plates), decreased acuity, disk edema and hyperemia acutely, optic
atrophy in chronic state. See Box 11.2
• Cerebral hemispheres: (subcortical white matter)
• Poor memory
• Disinhibition (late)
• Dementia (late)
• Cortical
• Epilepsy (10%)
• Characteristic symptoms/signs
• Lhermitte sign: neck flexion causes paresthesias or tingling down
the spine due to a cervical cord plaque. Other causes: B12 deficiency,
cervical spondylosis, or tumor
• Uhtoff phenomenon: worsening of symptoms, e.g., vision, when
body temperature is raised due to, e.g., exercise
• Internuclear ophthalmoplegia. Other causes: vascular, Wernicke
encephalopathy, pseudo-INO in MG

Course of disease
• Eighty-five percent present with relapsing/remitting disease (RRMS)
• Average age of onset is 24–29 years
• Females affected > males

Box 11.2 Optic neuritis and its association with MS
Optic neuritis—inflammatory demyelination of the optic nerve
• Presenting symptom in 30% of patients who developed MS within 5
years in Optic Neuritis Treatment Trial (ONTT)
• Fifty percent of MS patients will have optic neuritis at some time
• Thirty–five percent recurrence rate; recurrence associated with
increased risk of developing MS
Prognosis with regard to developing MS
• ON (single episode) and normal brain MRI: <10% probability to
progress to MS
• ON and three or more typical MRI lesions: >80% progress to MS
Treatment of ON
• There is no treatment that influences ultimate visual outcome.
• IV corticosteroids will hasten recovery of vision during a
demyelinating episode and may delay onset of MS.
• Oral corticosteroids are ineffective in treatment of ON and may lead
to worse visual outcome than with no treatment.
• Institution of chronic immune-modifying therapy, e.g., interferons,
in otherwise asymptomatic patients with ON and two or more
brain lesions consistent with those seen in MS reduces rate of
progression to clinically definite MS.

315

316

CHAPTER 11

Infectious and inflammatory conditions

• After 10–15 years, 50%–60% enter the secondary progressive phase
some with relapses (SPMS)
• Ten percent have primary progressive disease (PPMS) with gradual
accumulation of disability
• Average age of onset is 35–39 years
• Males affected > females
• Disability accrued throughout disease course is measured by the
Kurtzke Disability Status Scale (see Appendix, p. 452) and its extended
scale (EDSS)

Multiple sclerosis: investigations
and diagnosis
Investigations
MRI (see Figs. 11.7 and 11.8)
• T2W high signal changes seen in the corpus callosum, periventricular
white matter, brainstem
• In patients >50 years, white matter lesions are less specific as they are
found in normal individuals and those with cerebrovascular disease and
migraine.
Evoked responses
• Visual evoked responses (VER): delay is the most sensitive method
of demonstrating previous optic neuritis after clinical recovery or in
subclinical disease
• Somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEP) and brainstem evoked
potential (BSEP) less useful
CSF oligoclonal bands (OCB)
• Presence of OCB in the CSF not in the serum indicate inflammation
confined to the CNS
• Positive in 95% of clinically definite MS
• May be present in other disorders such as paraneoplastic syndromes,
vasculitis, autoimmune disorders, infections

Diagnosis of MS
See Box 11.3 for the McDonald criteria for diagnosis of MS.
• MS is a clinical diagnosis with a prerequisite of evidence of lesions
disseminated in time and space and to the exclusion of mimics.
• It is not possible to diagnose MS after a single monophasic episode
even if there are multiple lesions on MRI as there is no dissemination
in time.
• After an isolated episode of demyelination, an abnormal brain MRI
suggests that the likelihood of suffering a further attack and therefore
of making a diagnosis of MS is 90% compared to 15% if the brain MRI
is normal.

Differential diagnosis
ADEM. See p. 322.

320

CHAPTER 11

Infectious and inflammatory conditions

• Side effects (intravenous): flushing, psychiatric disturbance, insomnia,
hyperglycemia, hypertension. Exclude infection prior to treatment
(urinalysis). Rarely, aseptic bone necrosis reported

Disease-modifying treatments (DMT)
• Interferon beta is a natural cytokine with effects on the immune system.
• Three injectable preparations are available: IFN beta-1b (Betaseron© );
IFN beta-1a (Avonex© ); IFN beta-1a (Rebif © )
• Development of neutralizing antibodies may limit efficacy
• Side effects include injection site reactions, flu-like symptoms,
fatigue, and depression
• Glatiramer acetate (Copaxone) is a combination of amino acids.
• Neutralizing antibodies detected in some studies—unclear
significance
• Side effects include injection site reactions, chest pain, flushing,
dyspnea, and anxiety
• All drugs decrease frequency of relapse by one-third: i.e., from 3 to 2
relapses over 3 years.
• IFN beta reduces progression of disability compared to placebo. It is
not clear if this is sustained.
• The effect of IFN beta in secondary progressive disease is unclear. May
be effective in those with superimposed relapsing disease.
• IFN beta shows no effect in primary progressive disease.
In patients with aggressive disease unresponsive to IFN:
• Mitoxantrone. Limited by lifetime cumulative dose owing to cardiac
toxicity
• Monoclonal antibodies natalizumab and alemtuzumab (Campath-1H)
should be considered. Natalizumab (Tysabri) is in clinical use
and is highly effective but has induced progressive multifocal
leukoencephalopahthy in 5 patients thus far (of about 14,000 treated).
Alemtuzumab, rituximab, and other monoclonal antibodies are under
study.
Other DMT options
• Immunosuppressive therapy: cyclophosphamide (pulsed or daily),
azathioprine, mycophenolate, or MTX for rapidly progressive or
chronically progressing disability
• Plasma exchange for rapidly progressing disability
• IVIG reduces relapse rate; unclear if disease progression slowed
• Stem cell transplantation and total lymphoid irradiation considered in
severe progressive forms of disease

Symptomatic treatment
Spasticity
• Treat any infections, constipation, pain
• Physiotherapy essential
• Baclofen starting 5 mg/day increased to 40 mg q8hr. Limited by side
effects of sedation, muscle weakness
• Tizanidine starting 2 mg/day increased to 8 mg q8hr. LFTs need
monitoring

NEUROMYELITIS OPTICA (DEVIC DISEASE)

• Dantrolene starting 25 mg/day increased to 100 mg q8hr. Monitor LFTs
• Gabapentin starting at 100 mg increased to 800 mg q8hr helps tonic
spasms or phasic spasticity
• Focal spasticity, e.g., adductor spasm, use botulinum toxin
• In severe lower limb spasticity resistant to therapy, intrathecal baclofen
via a pump
Bladder dysfunction
There are three aspects of neurogenic bladder dysfunction:
• Detrusor hyperreflexia characterized by reduced capacity, urgency,
frequency, and incontinence
• Detrusor/sphincter dyssynergia associated with urgency, delayed
emptying, retention
• Bladder hyporeflexia characterized by incomplete emptying and
increased residual urine. All three may be present simultaneously.
Symptomatic treatment includes the following:
• Even distribution of fluid intake (2 L/day)
• Pelvic floor exercises help urgency and incontinence.
• Measure residual urine volume by catheter or bladder US. If >100 mL,
consider intermittent self-catheterization. May be limited by disability
• Detrusor hyperreflexia treated with
• Oxybutynin 2.5 mg bid–5 mg bid
• Oxybutynin XL 5 mg daily
• Tolterodine 2–4 mg/day
• Tolterodine XL 4 mg daily
• Nocturia managed by intranasal desmopressin 10–20 µg. Side effect
hyponatremia
Fatigue
Fatigue is common and worsened by heat.
• Exclude other causes, e.g., decreased Hb, increased T4
• Fatigue management classes with aerobic training
• Screen for depression and treat
• Amantadine, 100–200 mg daily
• Modafinil, 100–200 mg daily

Neuromyelitis optica (Devic disease)
Neuromyelitis optica is felt to be closely related to multiple sclerosis, but
specific diagnostic criteria set it apart as a separate entity. Key features
are as follows:
• Optic neuritis and myelitis occurring together or in succession
• Spinal cord lesion three or more segments in length or NMO-IgG
antibody positivity
Other CNS involvement is allowable as long as the above criteria are met.

Features
• Onset of disease can be fulminant with severe deficits—element of
necrosis in addition to demyelination can be demonstrated

321

322

CHAPTER 11

Infectious and inflammatory conditions

• Prognosis for recovery of vision and spinal cord function is guarded.
• Primary progressive or relapsing-remitting

Treatment
Treatment should be aggressive given the severity of disease. Consideration
should be given to long-term immunosuppression in relapsing-remitting
forms.
• Plasma exchange (seven exchanges on alternate days in acute phase),
plus IV methylprednisolone 1 g on alternate days x5)—alternating
plasma exchange and IV methylprednisolone treatments
• Long-term immunosuppression with steroid-sparing agents such as
azathioprine combined with oral prednisone has been used to decrease
relapse rates; observational studies suggest that mitoxantrone, IVIG, or
rituximab may be effective in this regard as well.

Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis
(ADEM)
ADEM is also known as postinfectious encephalomyelitis and postvaccinal
myelitis as it occurs during or following viral or bacterial infection or following vaccination.

Pathogenesis
•
•
•
•
•

An autoimmune reaction targeting central myelin
Can be triggered by many viruses and vaccines
No viral particles have been isolated from areas of demyelination
Any area of the brain or spinal cord can be affected
Numerous demyelinated plaques with sharp edges primarily in white
matter
• Perivenular lymphocytic and mononuclear cell infiltration

Clinical features
• Meningeal involvement is common, leading to meningismus and
headache
• Irritability, stupor, or coma
• Any (and many) portions of the brain parenchyma may be affected,
leading to focal symptoms and signs
• Aphasia
• Hemiplegia
• Bilateral optic neuritis
• Cranial nerve palsies
• Ataxia
• Spinal cord involvement is common: acute transverse myelitis
• Often at thoracic levels—affecting motor and sensory tracts
• Back pain
• Ascending sensory loss
• Paraparesis
• Bowel and bladder dysfunction

NEUROSARCOIDOSIS

Diagnosis
• Clinical history—neurologic signs occurring within 1 month of viral
infection (particularly exanthematous), upper respiratory infection, or
vaccination
• Supportive imaging of multiple, uniformly enhancing, large
demyelinating lesions of brain or spinal cord; gray matter may be
involved
• LP: increased protein, normal glucose, mildly increased MBP, mildly
increased WBC (lymphocytic predominance); OCB positive in 30% and
may disappear
• EEG: nonspecific generalized slowing; possible focal slowing related to
lesions
• “No other cause found”—differential includes all other inflammatory
demyelinating disorders

Treatment
ADEM is monophasic and self-limiting most commonly, but it may be recurrent. Treatment may be instituted to reduce or limit neurologic deficits.
• ACTH or corticosteroids
• IVIG
• Plasma exchange

Prognosis
• Related to preceding infection and severity, location, and extent of
lesions
• Mortality rate up to 30% in patients with severe cerebral involvement
• In survivors, 90% with complete recovery (except after ADEM
triggered by measles where deficits remain in up to 50% of patients
Acute hemorrhagic leukoencephalitis (AHL)
AHL represents a hyperacute and more severe form of ADEM. Lesions
often are large, with hemorrhage, and exhibit mass effect. Prognosis is
poorest for neurologic recovery in this form.

Neurosarcoidosis
Sarcoidosis is a granulomatous disease of unknown etiology that may affect
any organ system. Greater than 90% of cases have pulmonary involvement.
A pathognomonic feature of sarcoidosis is the noncaseating granuloma
containing multinucleated giant cells and epithelioid cells.

Epidemiology
• Worldwide occurrence with prevalence of 3–50 (average 10–20) per
100,000
• Geographic and racial variation in prevalence worldwide
• In United States, highest prevalence in African Americans (2.4% lifetime
risk vs. 0.85% in Caucasians)

infectious cause identified
• Susceptibility to and severity of disease associated with polymorphisms
of the MHC

Clinical features
• Sarcoidosis—common systemic signs and symptoms
• Fatigue, fever, anorexia
• Dyspnea, cough
• Rash—erythema nodosum
• Arthralgias
• Abnormal chest X-ray with hilar adenopathy
Lofgren syndrome
Hilar adenopathy, erythema nodosum, migratory polyarthralgias, and fever;
female predominance.
Neurological involvement in sarcoidosis is present in 5% of all cases.
Sarcoid granulomas can occur anywhere in the CNS or PNS, but they have a
predilection for occurrence in cranial nerves and at the base of the brain.
• Sarcoidosis—neurologic involvement
• Cranial neuropathy—present in >50% of cases of neurosarcoidosis:
(most frequently cranial nerve VII)
• Parenchymal granulomas—focal or widely dispersed
• Seizures
• Cognitive changes
• Infarction (rare)
• Neuroendocrine function affected (predilection for hypothalamus)
• Meningeal involvement
• Aseptic meningitis
• Hydrocephalus
• Peripheral neuropathy—single or multiple mononeuropathies or
polyneuropathy
• Myopathy—palpable nodules or diffuse infiltration—focal or diffuse
weakness
Heerfordt syndrome (uveoparotid fever)
Cranial nerve 7 palsy, uveitis, parotitis

Diagnosis
• Definitive diagnosis by tissue biopsy
• Supportive labs and imaging (if normal, diagnosis is not excluded)
• Labs: serum calcium, ACE, sodium, endocrinologic studies
• LP: CSF ACE, elevated protein, low glucose, elevated IgG index,
white blood cells in CSF (lymphocytic predominance and with
elevated CD4:CD8 ratio)
• Chest X-rays, CT: hilar adenopathy, fibronodular disease
• MRI (neuraxis): contrast enhancing nodules, meningeal and
occasionally vascular enhancement (see Fig. 11.9)
• Further testing and biopsy determined in individual cases by organ
system involved

CHAPTER 11

Infectious and inflammatory conditions

Treatment
• None—with mild and/improving symptoms—disease is monophasic
and spontaneously remitting in 67% of neurosarcoidosis
• Corticosteroids: 0.5–1.5 mg/kg/day orally (IV methylprednisolone at 20
mg/kg/day x 3 days may precede oral treatment with severe disease or
rapid neurological deterioration). Taper according to severity of disease
and response to treatment
• Steroid-sparing immunosuppressive medications for patients intolerant
to steroids and/or with severe disease
• Azathioprine, methotrexate, mycophenolate mofetil,
cyclophosphamide, cyclosporine, chlorambucil, cladribine, infliximab,
hydroxychloroquine, pentoxifylline, and thalidomide have all been used
with some degree of success

CHAPTER 12

Neoplastic and paraneoplastic disorders

Classification of intracranial tumors
Epidemiology
Intracranial tumors are the sixth most common neoplasm in adults and
the most common solid tumors in children. Incidence of all primary brain
tumors is 14–21/100,000/year.

Types of intracranial tumors
Primary brain tumors
• Pilocytic astrocytoma, grade I
• Astrocytoma, grade II
• Anaplastic astrocytoma, grade III
• Glioblastoma multiforme, grade IV (see Fig. 12.1)
• Oligodendroglioma
• Ependymoma
• Choroid plexus papilloma
• Neuronal tumors or mixed tumors (e.g., ganglioglioma)
• Embryonal tumors (medulloblastoma, PNET)
• Pineal parenchymal tumors
Other intracranial tumors
• Metastatic tumors (breast and lung most common)
• Meningeal tumors (meningioma)
• Vascular tumors (hemangioblastomas)
• Pituitary adenomas
• Germ cell tumors (germinoma, teratoma)
• Primary CNS lymphoma
• Nerve sheath tumors (vestibular schwannoma)
• Developmental tumors (epidermoid, craniopharyngioma, colloid cyst)
• Chondroid matrix tumors (chondrosarcoma, chordoma)

Etiology
•
•
•
•

Most are sporadic.
Cranial irradiation increases risk of meningioma.
Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome is associated with hemangioblastoma.
Neurofibromatosis I is associated with neurofibromas and optic nerve
gliomas.
• Neurofibromatosis II is associated with vestibular schwannoma and
meningioma.
• Tuberous sclerosis is associated with giant cell astrocytoma.

Clinical features
Symptoms from increased intracranial pressure
• Local mass effect
• Obstruction of CSF outflow (more common with posterior fossa
lesions)

CHAPTER 12

Neoplastic and paraneoplastic disorders

Other symptoms
• Headache (often worse in morning)
• Nausea/vomiting
• Ataxia
• Mental status changes
• Papilledema
• Diplopia (CNVI palsy due to increased intracranial pressure)
Progressive neurological deficits
• Supratentorial lesions present with cortical deficits
• Hemiparesis
• Hemibody neglect
• Visual field deficit
• Aphasia
• Cognitive or behavioral changes (frontal lesions)
• Posterior fossa lesions
• Appendicular and/or gait ataxia
• Cranial nerve palsies
• Diplopia
• Hydrocephalus
• New onset seizure
• Should prompt an investigation for neoplasm
• Seizures are presenting symptom in 25% of tumors

Imaging features
• MRI +/− gadolinium most sensitive for tumor evaluation
• Special high-resolution protocols necessary for some tumor
evaluations (e.g., pituitary protocol, CN VIII protocol for vestibular
schwannoma)
• CT a useful adjunct
• Calcification (e.g., oligodendroglioma)
• Calvarium remodeling (slowly growing neoplasms)
• Skull base involvement (meningioma, chondrosarcoma)
• Cerebral angiogram
• Useful for determination of tumor vascularity
• Some tumor resections are preceded by endovascular embolization
to decrease blood loss.

Other investigations
For metastatic workup
• Complete history and physical, including breast, GU, and rectal
examinations
• Chest X-ray
• Chest/abdomen/pelvic CT
• Mammogram
• Bone scan
• PET scan
• Lumbar puncture for cytology when meningeal spread suspected
(contraindicated for abscess or mass lesion)

GENERAL MANAGEMENT OF INTRACRANIAL TUMORS

For specific tumor types
• Ophthalmologic examination for CNS lymphoma to detect vitreous
involvement
• Serum and CSF alpha feto protein, beta HCG and CEA for pineal
region tumors (germ cell tumors)
• Total spine MRI for dropped metastases (ependymoma,
medulloblastoma)

Differential diagnosis
Infection
• Abscess, encephalitis may mimic high-grade glioma
• Parasite
• Cysticercosis, hydatid cyst
Vascular
• Cavernoma
• Arteriovenous malformation (AVM)
• Aneurysm
Inflammatory
• Acute MS plaque

General management of intracranial
tumors
Management of tumors requires consideration of the following:
• Need for tissue diagnosis
• Location of lesion and possible postoperative deficits
• Likelihood that aggressive resection will or will not prolong survival
• Adjunctive therapies for specific tumor types (radiation, chemotherapy)
• Patient age and medical comorbidities
• Quality of life

Preoperative management
• Corticosteroids reduce vasogenic edema, useful in symptomatic
patients
• Anticonvulsants are not routinely recommended in seizure-free
patients
• Frequent neurological checks
• Maintain serum Na in normal range
• Avoid hypotonic IV fluids
• Elevate head of bed more than 30 degrees

Neurosurgical procedures
Stereotactic biopsy: Precise placement of a biopsy needle into a brain
lesion to obtain a tissue diagnosis. Either frame-based or frameless using
neuronavigation. Two percent risk of symptomatic hemorrhage.

331

332

CHAPTER 12

Neoplastic and paraneoplastic disorders

Ommaya reservoir: Subcutaneous access device under scalp connected to
a ventricular catheter, used to facilitate intrathecal chemotherapy (Rickham
reservoir is a common alternative).
Neuronavigation: (e.g., Stealth, Brainlab) Computer-based device that
allows the surgeon to register the patient’s head and brain to preoperative
imaging to allow precise localization during surgery.
Craniotomy: A bone flap is removed to allow increased visualization and
room for tumor resection.

Management of specific tumor types
Astrocytoma
• Grade I (Pilocytic astrocytoma): may be cured surgically, excellent
prognosis (Fig. 12.2)
• Grade II (low-grade astrocytoma): mean survival 5 years
• Radiotherapy and aggressive resection may confer a survival
advantage if safe to do so
• May progress to glioblastoma (Fig. 12.1)
• Grade III (anaplastic astrocytoma): mean survival 2–3 years
• Treated similar to GBM
• Grade IV (glioblastoma, GBM): mean survival 12 months
• Treated with fractionated radiotherapy and concurrent
temozolomide, an oral chemotherapeutic agent
• Aggressive resection may confer a survival advantage

Meningioma
• WHO grade I: benign meningioma
• Make up 85% of meningiomas
• May have hormonal receptors (octreotide, progesterone)
• WHO grade II and III: anaplastic and malignant meningioma
• High recurrence rate
• Often treated with resection and radiotherapy
• May be fatal
Indication for surgical management
• Radiographic growth
• Symptomatic mass effect or cranial neuropathies
• Most can be followed radiographically without resection
Surgical management
• Complete tumor resection requires removal of all involved dura and
bone (hyperostosis).
• Subtotal resection has a high recurrence rate.
• Parasagittal tumors may involve the superior sagittal sinus.
• Skull base tumors (e.g., clivus, cavernous sinus) may be treated with
subtotal resection and radiotherapy.
• Radiotherapy (conventional or stereotactic) is effective in controlling
growth in up to 80% of tumors.

Diagnostic tests
• CT: iso- to hyperintense periventricular lesions
• MRI: periventricular enhancing lesions, dural enhancement if CSF
involved
• LP: pleocytosis, flow cytometry may demonstrate monoclonal B cell
population, frequently nondiagnostic
• Slit lamp exam: mandatory in all patients to rule out vitreous
involvement (a common site for relapse)
• Stereotactic brain biopsy: most common diagnostic test,
corticosteroids given preoperatively may decrease diagnostic yield by
shrinking tumor
Treatment
• Avoid corticosteroids if possible
• Intravenous methotrexate, mean survival 4 years
• Intrathecal methotrexate for leptomeningeal involvement
• Radiotherapy

Cerebral metastasis
Etiology

• Acute hemorrhage (renal cell carcinoma, melanoma)
Imaging features
• Ring or solid contrast enhancement (Fig. 12.3)
• Often at the corticomedullary junction
• Single or multiple
• Intraparenchymal mass with history of carcinoma = 90% chance of
metastasis
Treatment
• Corticosteroids if symptomatic mass effect
• If atypical presentation for metastasis, a tissue diagnosis should be
obtained via craniotomy or stereotactic biopsy
• Surgical excision of 1–3 metastasis with whole-brain radiation confers
greatest survival (9–12 months)

337

338

CHAPTER 12

Neoplastic and paraneoplastic disorders

• Ophthalmologic referral for visual field testing to ensure normal
chiasm
• Petrosal venous sinus sampling: hormonal testing directly from the
petrosal sinus can help localize a small adenoma not seen on MRI (esp.
Cushing microadenoma)
• Hormal testing necessary for all pituitary tumor patients
• TSH, Free T4, LH, FSH, GH, PRL, am cortisol. Somatomedin C (for
acromegaly)
• Note mild elevations of prolactin may be seen in macroadenomas
other than prolactinomas (stalk effect)
Treatment
• Hormone replacement: as needed based on endocrinologic workup
• Surveillance MRI: for asymptomatic nonsecretory adenomas, no
treatment necessary
• Prolactinomas
• For symptomatic prolactinomas, initial treatment is medical, not
surgical.
• Bromocriptine or other dopamine agonist will reduce and/or
control most prolactinomas.
• Surgery is used only for prolactinomas not responsive to medical
therapy or in the case of progressive visual deficit.
• ACTH-secreting tumors, Cushing disease
• Transphenoidal surgery is first-line treatment
• Often difficult to locate microadenoma
• Recurrences treated with repeat surgery or radiation
• Adrenelectomy reserved for cases that do not respond to pituitary
exploration
• GH-secreting tumors, acromegaly
• Transphenoidal surgery is first-line treatment

CHAPTER 13

Neurotrauma

Cranial trauma
Epidemiology
• Trauma is the leading cause of death under age 45.
• Fifty percent of these deaths are due to traumatic brain injury (TBI).
• Fifty-two thousand deaths/year in the United States occur because of
TBI.
• Fifty percent of TBIs are due to motor vehicle collisions.
• Alcohol is a factor in over 50% of TBI.
• Mortality for severe TBI (GCS <9) is 33%.
• Men are twice as likely as women to sustain TBI.

Pathophysiology
Primary injury
• Occurs at time of trauma
• Due to the following forces applied to the brain or surrounding
structures:
• Compressive: Tissue compression
• Tensile: tissue stretch
• Shear: tissues sliding past one another
Diffuse axonal injury
• Disruption of subcortical axons
• Mainly due to shear injury
• May be inferred from petechial hemorrhages in basal ganglia, corpus
callosum (a marker of shear injury)
Intracranial hemorrhages
• Subdural hematoma: tearing of bridging veins
• Epidural hematoma: injury to meningeal artery
• Traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage
• Contusions
Skull fractures
• Marker for point of impact
• Beware of underlying epidural hematoma
Penetrating brain injuries
• Gun shot wound
• Other penetrating missiles, e.g., shrapnel, nail gun injuries
Secondary injury
• Occurs hours to days after insult
• May be mediated by excitatory amino acids
• Increased intracranial pressure (ICP)
• Decreased cerebral perfusion pressure
• Hydrocephalus

CRANIAL TRAUMA

Figure 13.1 CT and MRI of parenchymal contusion and hemorrhage. Axial CT
demonstrates areas of low attenuation in the right thalamus consistent (arrow)
with parenchymal contusion. Subarachnoid hemorrhage is seen as high attenuation
in the sulci (A). Both deep gray and white injury are seen as high FLAIR signal
abnormalities in bilateral thalami, corpus callosum, and deep white matter (B).
Deep white matter lesions are indicative of axonal injury.

CHAPTER 13

Neurotrauma

Classificaton of TBI
• GCS 13–15: mild TBI
• GCS 9–12: moderate TBI
• GCS 3–8: severe TBI

Initial assessment
Advanced trauma life support protocol
• Secure airway
• Vigorous cardiovascular resuscitation
• Hypoxia and hypotension are poor prognostic factors.
Assess GCS (see Table 13.1)
• Emergent head CT if GCS <15 or focal neurologic abnormalities
Assess cervical spine
• Radiographs must be obtained if cervical pain is present or GCS <15.
Pertinent physical examination
• Hemotympanum
• Rhinorrhea
• Raccoon eye (periorbital bruising) and Battle sign (mastoid ecchymosis)
indicate skull base fracture
• Spine tenderness, kyphosis, or spinous process “step off” (anterior
or forward displacement of one spinous process relative to another,
suggesting spinal subluxation)

MANAGEMENT OF TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY (TBI)

Management of traumatic

Indication for head CT
•
•
•
•
•
•

Abnormal sensorium, GCS <15
Inebriated patient
Focal neurological deficit
Seizure
Rhinorrhea
Progression of symptoms

Hospitalization
• All patients with moderate and severe TBI (GCS <13) should be
hospitalized.
• Selected patients with mild TBI and normal head CT can be discharged
home with head injury instructions if a reliable adult can observe the
patient.
• Intubate for
• GCS <9
• Worsening GCS
• Insecure airway
• Severe maxillofacial trauma
• Maintain head of bed >30%
• Decreases ICP
• Frequent neurological checks by nursing and physicians
• Stat head CT if neurological change occurs
• Intravenous fluids: 0.9% normal saline
• Avoid hyponatremia and cerebral edema
• Control body temperature
• Increased temperature may increase ICP

Mannitol
There is no role for prophylactic administration of mannitol unless the
neurological examination is worsening or ICP is worsening.

Decadron
There is no role for steroids in TBI.

ICP monitoring
• Ventriculostomy is more accurate than intraparenchymal pressure
transducer.
• Ventriculostomy allows treatment of high ICP by draining CSF.

Bariturate coma
• May control ICP when other measures have been utilized to the
maximum
• Titrate to burst suppression on EEG

349

350

CHAPTER 13

Neurotrauma

Decompressive hemicraniectomy
• Aggressive treatment for high ICP unresponsive to other measures

Guidelines of the Brain Trauma Foundation
Hypoxia and blood pressure
• Maintain systolic blood pressure >90 mmHg
• Maintain O2 saturation >90%
ICP monitoring
• ICP monitoring is recommended for all patients with GCS <9 and an
abnormal head CT.
• Ventriculostomy is preferred.
• Maintain ICP <20 mmHg
Hyperosmolar agents
• Mannitol is effective in controlling increased ICP.
• Dose is 0.25 to 1.0 mg/kg
• Maintain euvolemia
Cerebral perfusion pressure
• Target range 50–70 mmHg
• Aggressive attempts to reach 70 mmHg associated with acute
respiratory distress syndrome and worse outcome
Anticonvulsants
• Anticonvulsants should be discontinued 1 week after trauma unless
late seizures develop.
• Prophylactic anticonvulsants do not decrease the development of late
seizures (>1 week post trauma); they do decrease the risk of early
seizures, but these are not correlated with worse outcome.
Hyperventilation
• Prophylactic hyperventilation worsens prognosis.
• There is a role for short-term hyperventilation as a bridge to definitive
therapy (e.g.,on the way to the OR for subdural evacuation).

Prognosis
• GCS
• GCS 3–5 = 80% dead or with severe disability
• GCS 6–8 = 30% dead or with severe disability
• GCS 9–13 = 15% dead or with severe disability
• Increasing age
• Worsens prognosis
• Pupillary reflex
• Bilaterally nonreactive pupils associated with death or vegetative
state in ~90% of cases
• Hemodynamic
• Hypotension and hypoxia worsen outcomes

Space-occupying lesions
• Expanding mass lesions require emergent attention.
• Initially, cerebral hemispheric compression causes contralateral focal
signs followed by mental status depression and finally ipsilateral 3rd
nerve palsy due to uncal herniation.
• This will progress to transtentorial herniation causing motor posturing
(decerebrate rigidity) and absent brainstem reflexes
• May result in Cushing response (bradycardia and hypertension)
• False localizing sign: hemiparesis ipsilateral to the lesion may occur due
to cerebral peduncle compression on edge of contralateral tentorium
(Kernohan notch)

Epidural hematoma (EDH)
• A coup injury (ipsilateral to direct trauma)
• Cause is tear of meningeal artery often due to fracture
• Classically associated with initial loss of consciousness, then normal
sensorium (lucid interval) followed by deteriorating mental status
• May rapidly deteriorate
Imaging
• CT: biconvex (“lentiform”) high-density extra-axial hemorrhage that
does not cross suture lines
• Often underlying a skull fracture
• Fifty percent associated with a contrecoup injury
Management
• True neurosurgical emergency
• Intubate and infuse mannitol prior to surgery if deteriorating before
neurosurgical care is available
• Emergency frontotemporal craniotomy
Prognosis
• Depends on preoperative GCS
• Excellent prognosis if patient is conscious prior to surgery

Acute subdural hematoma
• Typically occurs from high-energy trauma unless the patient has a
coagulopathy
• Highest mortality of posttraumatic mass lesions
• Immediate LOC with progressive neurological decline
• The underlying brain injury is often out of proportion to the size of the
subdural hematoma.
• The hemorrhage occurs from damage to cortical vessels or bridging
veins.
Imaging
• CT: hyperdense crescentric mass. May cross suture lines and extend
along falx cerebri and tentorium
• Hyperacute bleeding may cause low-density appearance on CT

Neurotrauma

Figure 13.2 Noncontrast head CT of right posterior fossa epidural hematoma
demonstrating lentiform shape and high-attenuation acute blood.
Management
• Indications for emergent surgical management include any of the
following:
• Progressive neurological deterioration
• Subdural thickness greater than 1 cm
• Midline shift greater than 5 mm
• Increased ICP
Procedure
• Large frontotemporoparietal craniotomy
• Bone flap left off if significant cerebral edema
• ICP monitoring often indicated

MANAGEMENT OF SPECIFIC HEAD INJURIES

Outcome
• In general worse than extradural hematoma
• Depends on presenting GCS and underlying brain injury
• Good outcome 30%
• Mortality 50%

Chronic subdural hematoma
• Late sequelae of mild to moderate head injury; up to 50% do not
remember an obvious head injury
• Risk factors are advanced age, alcoholism, and coagulopathy
• Clinical course often insidious and includes the following:
• Cognitive changes
• Gait dysfunction
• Focal neurological symptoms
• Transient neurological symptoms
• Headache
Imaging
• CT: low to iso-intense hemispheric extra-axial fluid collection
Management
• Small asymptomatic chronic SDH may be observed with serial head
CT to allow self-resolution.
Indications for surgery include
• Symptomatic SDH
• Midline shift
• Progressive increase in size on serial head CT
• Pressing need to restart anticoagulation
Procedure
• Most respond to burr hole drainage with subdural drain
• Recurrence rate 15%
• Complications include seizures, pneumocephalus, and subdural
empyema

Traumatic intracerebral hematoma (cerebral contusion)
• Small contusions may progress to significant ICH.
• Most do not require surgical evacuation
• Indications for surgical evacuation are progressive neurological deficit
or uncontrolled increase of ICP.
• May be result of coup or contrecoup injury
• ICH does not change the recommendation for 1 week of
anticonvulsant treatment.

Penetrating head injuries
• Mortality from gunshot wounds (GSW) higher than 50%
• Bihemispheric GSW usually fatal

CHAPTER 13

Neurotrauma

Figure 13.3 Noncontrast head CT of multiple subdural hematomas of varying
ages. Chronic subdural hematomas demonstrate CT attenuation below that of
brain (single white arrow, right frontal). Subacute hematomas are isointense to
brain (double white arrows left frontal), and acute subdurals demonstrate high
attenuation (black arrow, left occipital).

Significant risk of
• Infection/abscess
• CSF leak
• Vascular injury (especially if trajectory crosses Sylvian fissure or
interhemispheric fissure)
Management
• Begin anticonvulsants and antibiotics
• Angiogram should be performed on anyone with bullet trajectory near
vascular structures.
• Salvageable patients should undergo urgent craniotomy.

MANAGEMENT OF SPECIFIC HEAD INJURIES

Goals of surgery
• Debride and irrigate surface contaminants (bone, contaminants from
skin)
• Prevent CSF leak
• The bullet fragment is not retrieved unless it is found just at cortical
surface, then given to police officer following strict chain of evidence
guidelines
• Evacuation of large ICH
• Elevation of significantly depressed skull fractures
• Consider leaving off bone flap to treat high ICP

Diffuse axonal injury
•
•
•
•

Injury to subcortical axons due to shear injury
Usual cause of coma in patients with no mass lesion
May lead to persistent vegetative state if severe
May cause cerebral edema

Imaging
• CT: normal or petechial hemorrhages in deep cerebral structures
• MRI: multiple high FLAIR and T2 abnormalities in corpus callosum,
basal ganglia, and brainstem
Management
• ATLS protocol
• ICP monitoring and control

Basal skull fractures
Clinical features
• Raccoon eyes, Battle sign
• Rhinorrea
• Cranial neuropathies
• Carotid dissection
Management
• Most do not need surgical treatment.
• Most CSF leaks spontaneously heal in 1 week; if not, consider lumbar
drain and/or surgery.
• Avoid prophylactic antibiotics for CSF leak
• Orbital injuries may need surgical decompression.
• Severe maxillofacial trauma may need a combined neurosurgical
approach with otolaryngology, plastic surgery and/or ophthalmology.
• Nasal tubes are contraindicated with frontobasilar fractures.
Delayed complications
• Vascular
• Carotid/vertebral artery dissections
• Traumatic aneurysms
• Carotid cavernous fistulae
• Chronic SDH

355

356

CHAPTER 13

Neurotrauma

• Infections
• Cerebral abscess
• Subdural/epidural empyema
• Meningitis
• Epilepsy
• Occurs in 2.5% of all TBI patients
• Occurs in 10%–15% of severe TBI patients
• Incidence of posttraumatic epilepsy not affected by prophylactic
anticonvulsant use
• Cranial nerve deficit
• Loss of olfaction is the most common.
• Vesticulocochlear injury with posttraumatic vertigo
• Facial paresis
• Trigeminal injury
• Behavioral abnormalities, headaches, and depression

Spinal trauma
• Often associated with multiple injuries and head trauma
• Early immobilization in the field and early detection are critical.

Complete lesion refers to the complete lack of motor and/or sensory
function below the level of the lesion.
Incomplete lesion refers to some degree of motor and/or sensory
function below the lesion.
Spinal level is defined as the lowest level of normal motor and sensory
function.

Spinal shock refers to hemodynamic effects and motor flaccidity noted
early after some cervical spine injuries, may last 1–2 weeks.

Spinal stability
Instability is defined as loss of maintenance normal anatomical spinal alignment under normal physiologic loads.
Thoraclumbar stability is classified according to the Denis three-column
model:
• Anterior column: anterior one-half of the vertebral body plus annulus
fibrosis and anterior longitudinal ligament
• Middle column: posterior one-half of the vertebral body plus annulus
fibrosis and posterior longitudinal ligament
• Posterior column: pedicles plus laminae, spinous processes, and dorsal
ligaments
The spine is unstable if two or three columns are disrupted.

Acute cord injury
Management
• Resuscitation and airway protection
• Immobilization of the neck and log roll precautions during assessment

SPINAL TRAUMA

(hangman fracture). White arrow points to the pars interarticularis of C2, which
can be followed ventrally to identify the fracture. Please note the subluxation of C2
on C3.

• Treatment of life-threatening injuries and bleeding
• Full neurological examination to determine level and completeness of
lesion
• Palpate spine for step off
• Note any autonomic dysfunction, e.g., priapism, ileus

357

358

CHAPTER 13

Neurotrauma

• IV methylprednisolone may improve outcome of injury if given within
8 hours but increases risk of pneumonia and gastrointestinal complications.

Occipital cervical dislocation
• Often fatal
• Clinical signs include lower cranial neuropathies, motor dysfunction,
and basilar subarachnoid hemorrhage
• Sagittal CT of cervical spine will demonstrate widened or dislocated
C1-occipital condyle joint. MRI may show blood in this joint and
disruption of tectorial membrane

C1 fracture (Jefferson fracture)
• Axial loading injury resulting in multiple fractures of the ring of C1
• Nearly half are associated with a C2 fracture.
• Most patients are neurologically intact.
Imaging
• CT has the most diagnostic utility, will reveal fracture of ring of C1 in
up to four points
• MRI is useful to determine whether the transverse ligament is intact.
• Open-mouth X-rays suggest an intact transverse ligament if the overhang
of the sum of both lateral masses is 6 mm or less (rule of Spence).
Management
• “Stable” Jefferson fracture (transverse ligament intact) may be treated
in an external orthosis like the Miami J collar for 3 months.
• “Unstable” Jefferson fracture (transverse ligament disrupted) may be
treated in a halo orthosis for 3 months or internally fixated surgically.

C2 fracture (odontoid fracture)
Classification
• Type I: upper dens fracture (10%)
• Type II: base of neck and peg (60%)
• Type III: transverse fracture through C2 vertebral body (30%)
Clinical features
• Neck pain usually present
• Neurological injury is found in 20% of type II injuries
Imaging
• Cervical CT: most diagnostic
• MRI: useful for analysis of ligaments and spinal cord
• Open-mouth and lateral X-rays may be difficult to interpret
Management
• Type III: external orthosis
• Type II: halo or internal fixation (odontoid screw or C1, 2 fixation)
• Surgical intervention indicated when
• Peg displacement is >4 mm
• Persistent movement occurs when patient is immobilized in halo
• Symptomatic fibrous nonunion
• Comminuted C2 fracture

of the pars interarticularis
Clinical features
• Most patients are neurologically intact
• Neck pain
Imaging
• Usually evident on lateral c-spine X-ray
• CT is most sensitive
Management
• Most are treated with immobilization in a halo.
• Indications for surgical fixation
• Misalignment despite gentle traction and manipulation in awake
intact patient
• Movement in halo
• Nonunion after 3 months of immobilization in halo

Subaxial fractures (C3–C7)
Commonly associated with head injuries and severe neurological deficit
Clinical features
• Neck pain
• Radiculopathy
• Brown Séquard syndrome
• Quadriplegia
• Central cord syndrome (arm > leg weakness)
Imaging
• AP/lateral c-spine X-rays reveal most significant injuries, may need
swimmer’s view for lower c-spine
• CT more sensitive
• Flexion-extension films are only done on neurologically intact awake
patients with no skeletal injury to investigate ligamentous injury.
• MRI useful to evaluate ligamentous injury and spinal cord

Cervical facet dislocation
• Flexion injury resulting in superior facet on one or both sides moving
forward and “locking” on inferior facet
• High-energy injury
• Associated with significant dorsal ligamentous injury
Clinical features
• Usually associated with a severe spinal cord injury, especially if bilateral
• Spinal shock
• Unilateral facet dislocation: 25% intact neurologically/65% partial spinal
cord injury/10% complete spinal cord injury
Imaging
• Lateral c-spine will show facet dislocation

362

CHAPTER 13

Neurotrauma

• Subluxation of ~25% vertebral body is associated with unilateral facet
dislocation
• Subluxation of ~50% is associated with bilateral facet dislocation
• AP films show rotatory subluxation in unilateral facet dislocation
• MRI useful to identify traumatic disc rupture or spinal epidural
hematoma
Management
• Subluxation can be reduced with cervical traction in skull tongs if
patient is awake and can be examined, maximum of 5 lb per vertebral
body level of fracture
• Open reduction in the operating room if this fails
• The majority require surgical internal fixation once the spine is
realigned

Thoracolumbar fractures
• Caused by high force
• Associated with other visceral injuries, e.g.,aortic tear, sternal fracture
Classification
• Wedge: anterior column
• Burst: anterior and middle column
• Fracture dislocation: all columns
Clinical features
• Back pain
• Neurological deficit common
Imaging
• CT most sensitive for skeletal injury
• MRI for cord compression
Management
• Complete neurological deficit: proceed to internal fixation early to
mobilize patient and reduce complications
• Incomplete neurological deficit: emergent decompression and internal
fixation
• Unstable injury with no deficit: early internal fixation

CHAPTER 14

Neurosurgery

Degenerative spinal conditions: cervical
spine
Cervical degenerative disease is common, but care needs to be taken to
distinguish pathological conditions from changes due to aging.
• More than 95% of individuals >65 years will have MRI scan
abnormalities

Cervical spondylosis
Nonspecific degenerative process resulting in stenosis of the spinal canal
and or root canals. Factors include the following:
• Degenerate disc
• Osteophytes
• Hypertrophy of lamina, articular facets, ligamentum flavum, and
posterior longitudinal ligament
• Congenitally narrow canal
Most common levels affected are C5/C6 and C6/C7.
Mechanical/musculoskeletal neck pain
No root symptoms or signs. Management involves the following:
• Lifestyle and posture changes (occupational therapy)
• Anti-inflammatory drugs
• Physiotherapy
• Judicious use of a collar
• Facet joint or epidural injection of LA/steroids
• Surgery rarely indicated
Radiculopathy
Clinical features
• Referred pain in the arm due to root irritation (brachalgia)
• Initial symptom may be sensory (tingling, burning) in a dermatomal
distribution followed by radicular pain (which is in a myotomal pattern)
• Weakness
• Reflex abnormalities
• See Table 14.1.

Degenerative spinal conditions: thoracic
and lumbar spine
Thoracic disc prolapse
Symptomatic disc prolapses are rare, <1% of all protruded discs. Most
common level T11/T12.
Clinical features
• Pain localized to the spine or radicular. Nocturnal recumbent pain
typical
• Sensory symptoms and signs with a sensory level
• Spastic paraparesis or rarely a monoparesis
• Sphincter disturbance
• Rarely, a Brown–Sequard syndrome
Imaging
MRI for location, severity of cord compression, and associated myelomalacia
Management
• Radicular pain managed with analgesics and/or local nerve root block.
Surgery if intractable
• Progressive or significant myelopathy or sphincter dysfunction an
indication for surgery. If disc is heavily calcified or located midline
anterior, transthoracic approach is used. Posterior approach used for
lateral and soft anterolateral discs—usually a fusion procedure carried
out to ensure spinal stability

365

366

CHAPTER 14

Neurosurgery

Lumbar intervertebral disc prolapse
• Acute back pain is common but accompanied by sciatica in only 2%.
• L5/S1 disc and L4/5 disc prolapses account for >95%
Clinical features
• Acute or gradual onset pain in the back radiating through buttock,
thigh, leg to foot. L2 radiculopathy (unusual) causes anterior thigh
pain. Triggered by lifting, flexion, or rotation. Dull ache with shooting
exacerbations. Increased with coughing, sneezing, bending, or
prolonged sitting
• Weakness of ankle dorsiflexion and EHL (L5); plantar flexion (S1); knee
extension (L3, L4)
• Depressed or absent knee jerk (L3, L4); ankle jerk (S1)
• Straight leg raising (Lasegue sign) causes dermatomal pain.
• Positive femoral stretch test (hip extension with maximal knee flexion)
indicates L2, L3, or L4 root pathology. Other causes: psoas abscess or
hematoma
• Cauda equina syndrome (neurosurgical emergency)
• Bilateral leg pain or sensory disturbance
• Perianal, perineal, and saddle anaesthesia
• Urinary and/or faecal incontinence
• Low back pain
• Sexual dysfunction
• Bilateral motor and reflex deficits
Imaging
• MRI is the investigation of choice.
• CT or CT myelogram is a useful alternative.
• Most commonly a posterolateral prolapse will compress root just
proximal to exit foramen, e.g., L4/L5 disc compresses L5 root.
However, the L4 root will be affected by upwardly migrated L4/L5 disc
fragment or a far lateral disc protrusion.
Management
Acute back pain and 85% of sciatica resolve in 6–8 weeks with conservative
treatment. Note: exclude infection and tumor first.
• Initial bed rest, early mobilization
• Avoid bending, lifting, prolonged sitting
• Adequate analgesia
• Muscle relaxants, e.g., diazepam 2–5 mg
• Consider epidural or nerve root block
Indications for surgery
• Cauda equina syndrome
• Significant or progressive motor deficit
• Severe pain not responding to conservative measures
Surgery involves microdiscectomy. Recurrent disc herniation rate is 2%.
Recurrence of symptoms may also be due to scarring around nerve root.
MRI with Gd shows root enhancement.

CHAPTER 14

Neurosurgery

Lumbar canal stenosis
Narrowing of the spinal canal in the central, lateral recesses or intervertebral foraminae causing root compression. Most common: L4/5 and L3/L4.
Clinical features
• “Neurogenic claudication”: buttock and leg pain or motor deficit on
walking, standing, or lying supine. Alleviated by bending forward or
crouching. Exercise tolerance improved by cycling or pushing a trolley
• Usually bilateral but may affect only one leg
• Leg numbness or paraesthesiae
• Occasionally sphincter dysfunction or impotence
• Neurological examination may be normal.

Figure 14.2 Sagittal T2-weighted MRI of spinal stenosis. Severe multilevel cervical
stenosis (white arrows) causing spinal compression. Note the high T2 signal within
the cord at C3,4 and C5,6 consistent with spinal cord injury.

DEVELOPMENTAL ABNORMALITIES

Imaging
• MRI investigation of choice: bilateral facet hypertrophy. Lateral recess
stenosis results in a trefoil deformity on axial scans.
• CT or CT myelography is useful if MRI contraindicated or not available.
• Lateral flexion/extension views indicated to exclude spinal instability as
fusion may be necessary at decompression
Management
Mild symptoms: conservative management
• Rest
• Adequate analgesia
• Lumbar corset
• Physiotherapy for posture and trunk strengthening
• Epidural steroid/LA injections reported to result in long-term benefit
Surgery indicated if:
• Failure of conservative measures
• Pain
• Significant motor deficit
• Sphincter disturbance
Decompressive surgery consists of variations on lumbar laminectomies.
• If spondylolisthesis (AP slip of one vertebra on another) or instability,
fusion procedures performed
• Complications: dural tear and CSF leakage

Developmental abnormalities
Arachnoid cysts
Congenital CSF-containing cysts developing between arachnoid layers. Fifty
percent in the middle cranial fossa, 10% suprasellar, 10% cerebellopontine
angle. Less common sites include quadrigeminal cistern, hemispheric convexity, and the posterior fossa.
Clinical features
• Majority present in childhood
• Middle cranial fossa: seizures, headache, hemiparesis
• Suprasellar cysts: hydrocephalus, enlarged skull, developmental
delay, visual failure, and precocious puberty
• In adults, incidental finding
Imaging features
Sharply demarcated cysts, which may have mass effect. May communicate
with the subarachnoid space. Walls are indefinable.
• CT: CSF density with no enhancement. Typically, remodeling and
scalloping of adjacent walls is evident. Hemorrhage (rare)
• MRI: CSF signal intensity on all images. Null signal on FLAIR. DWI
images show free diffusion in contrast to epidermoid cysts, which show
restricted diffusion with increased signal. Other differential diagnoses:
cystic extra-axial tumor (usually has a wall, a solid component with
enhancement); cysticercosis; mega cisterna magna in the posterior fossa

369

370

CHAPTER 14

Neurosurgery

Management
• If asymptomatic, no treatment
• Symptomatic cysts drained either via a marsupialization into CSF
spaces (via a craniotomy or endoscopy) or via a shunt to the
peritoneum

Chiari malformation
Syndromes of hindbrain descent. four subtypes are probably unrelated.
Types 1 and 2 predominate.
Chiari 1 malformation (cerebellar ectopia)
Anatomy
Simple descent of cerebellar tonsils beyond the foramen magnum.
Elongated peg-shaped tonsils plug the foramen. Occasionally acquired
after LP. Cerebellar descent and arachnoid adhesions interfere with normal
transmission of CSF pressure waves across the FM to the spinal reservoir,
raising ICP and forcing fluid into the central canal of the spinal cord.
Clinical features
Usually presents in young adults.
• Suboccipital headache, increased with stooping, straining, coughing
• Brainstem compression with ataxia, lower cranial palsies, pyramidal
weakness
• Central cord syndrome due to the associated syringomyelia with
dissociated sensory loss in a cape distribution. Downbeat nystagmus
Management
Foramen magnum decompression by removal of 3 x 4 cm crescent of bone
from the posterior rim of FM. Restores CSF pathway and decompresses
syrinx. Complications: aseptic meningitis, CSF leak, hydrocephalus.
Chiari 2 malformation
Anatomy
Congenital hindbrain abnormality associated with spinal dysraphism (myelomeningocele, spina bifida). Descent of cerebellar tonsils, vermis, medulla,
fourth ventricle through FM. Associated with hydrocephalus and elongated
upper cervical nerves.
Clinical features
Present in infancy with the following:
• Hydrocephalus
• Respiratory distress
• Dysphagia and aspiration pneumonia
• Downbeat nystagmus
• Quadraparesis
High mortality from respiratory arrest.
Imaging features
MRI: S-bend medulla, tonsillar descent, large interthalamic connexus,
dysgenesis of corpus callosum, hydrocephalus, medullary compression,
syringomyelia.

DEVELOPMENTAL ABNORMALITIES

Figure 14.3 Sagittal T1-weighted brain MRI of Chiari I malformation
demonstrating cerebellar tonsilar ectopia (black arrow) down to the ring of C1.
Management
• Insertion of ventriculo-peritoneal (VP) shunt for hydrocephalus
• Posterior fossa decompression

Dandy–Walker malformation
• Agenesis of the vermis of the cerebellum, resulting in a large posterior
cerebellar cyst opening into the fourth ventricle
• Hydrocephalus is common.
• Associated with agenesis of the corpus callosum, occipital
encephalocele, spina bifida, syringomyelia
• Facial, ocular, and cardiovascular abnormalities
Management Insertion of a cyst-peritoneal shunt and/or ventriculoperitoneal shunt.

Aqueduct stenosis
Congenital aqueduct stenosis presents in childhood with hydrocephalus in
the first 3 months of life. Adult forms usually acquired due to inflammation,
infection, brainstem tumor, arachnoid cysts.

371

372

CHAPTER 14

Neurosurgery

Clinical features
• Symptoms and signs of increased ICP
• Cognitive impairment
• Visual field deficit
• Ataxia
• Incontinence
Management
• Insertion of a VP shunt
• Endoscopic third ventriculostomy (by creation of a hole in the floor of
the third ventricle allowing CSF to reach the basal cisterns bypassing
the aqueduct and fourth ventricles)

Spinal dysraphism (spina bifida)
Developmental defects of neural tube closure with a variety of
abnormalities:
• Spina bifida occulta. Often clinically insignificant finding of hypoplastic
posterior sacral elements with normal dural sac and skin cover. May
have skin stigmata: hairy patch, naevus. Associated with intradural

CHAPTER 14

Neurosurgery

lipomas, thickened filum terminale, diastematomyelia (split cord), and
dermoid cysts. Cause of tethered cord syndrome
• Neurogenic bladder
• Paraparesis
• Foot deformity
• Meningocele. Developmental absence of sacral and low lumbar
posterior elements with bulging meninges exposed at skin surface.
Neurological deficit in 30%
• Myelomeningocele. Congenital absence of posterior vertebral
elements, dura and maldevelopment of the terminal spinal cord. All
have a neurological deficit with, hydrocephalus in 80%. Associated with
Chiari 2 malformation
Management
Myelomeningocele requires early closure to decrease infection rate and
protect neural tissue from damage. Hydrocephalus may be apparent after
closure and treated with a VP shunt. With surgery 85% survive infancy,
most with normal IQ.

Syringomyelia
Caused by cavitations within the spinal cord with clinical deficits. May
coexist with a similar condition, syringobulbia. Due to abnormal CSF circulation resulting from anatomical abnormalities.

Causes
• Cerebellar ectopia (Chiari malformations)
• Intramedullary tumors
• Trauma

Clinical presentation
Usually early to mid adult life with:
• Cough and positional headache due to pathology at FM
• Lower motor neuron weakness in the hands and arms, e.g., wasted
hand + paraparesis of the legs
• Dissociated sensory loss (cape distribution) affecting spinothalamic
sensation but sparing posterior columns

Imaging features
Cranial and spinal MRI + Gd. Assessment of the craniocervical junction;
presence of any cord tumors.

Management
The natural history is unclear. Medical treatment based on physiotherapy,
occupational therapy, and pain management.
Surgery
• Decompression of the FM. May arrest and sometimes reverse
progression of syringomyelia

375

376

CHAPTER 14

Neurosurgery

• Syrinx cavity operations consist of a drainage procedure usually in
cases of progressive neurological deficits
• Syringo-arachnoid shunt
• Syringo-pleural shunt
Revision procedures often required.

Hydrocephalus
• Defined as an excessive accumulation of CSF caused by a disturbance
of formation, flow, or absorption
• Normal CSF production is 500 mL/24 hr
• Total CSF volume in an adult is 120–150 mL
• CSF is recycled 3× daily

Types of hydrocephalus
• Communicating hydrocephalus. Enlarged ventricles with preserved
CSF flow between ventricles and the subarachnoid space. Impaired
CSF reabsorption results in increased CSF pressure and ventricular
enlargement.
• Noncommunicating hydrocephalus or obstructive hydrocephalus
occurs when CSF outflow tracts are obstructed, e.g., exit foraminae of
the fourth ventricle (Magendie and Luschka)
• Hydrocephalus ex vacuo refers to compensatory ventricular
enlargement secondary to brain atrophy.
• Arrested hydrocephalus occurs usually in communicating
hydrocephalus due to incomplete obstruction when CSF production
is balanced by absorption. The CSF pressure may be normal. However,
patients may undergo decompensation spontaneously or after a minor
head injury.
• Normal-pressure hydrocephalus is a condition with low-grade
hydrocephalus with intermittently raised ICP.

Acute hydrocephalus
Etiology
• Posterior fossa tumors
• Cerebellar hemorrhage or infarction
• Colloid cyst of the third ventricle
• Ependymoma of the fourth ventricle
• SAH
• Trauma
• Acute meningitis
Clinical features
• Signs and symptoms of increased ICP
• Headache
• Vomiting
• Diplopia due to sixth nerve palsies

HYDROCEPHALUS

• Reduced upgaze
• Impaired conscious level
• Occasionally, especially with colloid cyst of the third ventricle, LOC
and sudden death

Chronic hydrocephalus
Etiology
• SAH
• Chronic meningitis
• Slow-growing posterior fossa tumors
• One-third of cases have no obvious cause.
Clinical features
• Gait disturbance (apraxia)
• Memory disturbance or dementia
• Urinary incontinence
• Symptoms and signs of increased ICP

Imaging features in hydrocephalus
CT/MRI features include the following:
• Ventricular enlargement with ballooning of frontal horns
• Enlargement of temporal horns
• Ballooning of the third ventricle
• Disproportionate enlargement of ventricles compared to sulci
(neuroradiological expertise necessary)
• Periventricular interstitial edema
• Thinned or upward bowing of corpus callosum on sagittal MRI
• A large fourth ventricle implies communicating hydrocephalus or
obstruction at the level of the fourth ventricular outflow; a small
fourth ventricle suggests aqueduct stenosis.

Congenital causes (may present with acute or chronic hydrocephalus):

•
•
•
•

Aqueduct obstruction
Arnold–Chiari malformation
Dandy–Walker syndrome
Benign intracranial cysts

Management
• Insertion of ventricular peritoneal (VP) shunt inserted via a frontal
or parietal burr hole. Attached to a combined valve and reservoir
connecting to a distal catheter tunneled under the skin and implanted
into the peritoneum
• Alternative sites: ventriculopleural shunt; ventriculo-(right) atrial
(VA) shunt. Both have a higher complication rate than VP shunt, e.g.,
pulmonary emboli in VA shunts
• Programmable shunt valve with variable settings that may be changed
by application of magnetic device to skin

377

378

CHAPTER 14

Neurosurgery

• Endoscopic third ventriculostomy. Creation of a hole in the floor of the
third ventricle allowing CSF to escape from the ventricular system to
the basal cisterns. Endoscope introduced into the anterior horn of the
lateral ventricle via a frontal burr hole, passed through the foramen of
Munro into the third ventricle and a hole punched anterior to tuber
cinereum
• In communicating hydrocephalus, e.g., due to acute meningitis, serial
LP, or an external lumbar drain may suffice in the acute period. A CSF
protein level >4 g/L will clog most shunts.

Normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH)
• NPH describes a syndrome of chronic communicating hydrocephalus
with normal CSF pressure at lumbar puncture.
• Long-term pressure monitoring reveals intermittently elevated
pressures, often at night.
• NPH may follow trauma, infection, or SAH.
• Majority are idiopathic
Clinical features
Presentation with some or all features of the classical Adam’s triad.
• Gait disturbance. Typically the gait is an apraxia, i.e., normal power
and sensation, but with an inability to lift the legs to walk. However,
performance of the bicycling maneuver on the bed is remarkably intact.
• Cognitive impairment. Gradual slowing of verbal and motor responses
and patients may seem apathetic or depressed
• Urinary incontinence
Additional symptoms may include drop attacks and brief episodes of LOC.
Imaging features
• CT. Enlarged ventricles including temporal horns but with normal sulci
• MRI
• No hippocampal volume loss to account for large temporal horns
• Corpus callosum bowing and accentuation of aqueduct flow void
are predictors of a good response to shunting in some studies.
• Presence of periventricular deep white matter lesions indicative of
small-vessel disease are associated with a poor response.
• Isotope cisternography. A tracer injected into the CSF normally fails
to enter the ventricles. In patients with NPH reflux of tracer into
the ventricles within 24 hours with retention for 24–48 hours. The
usefulness of this technique is controversial.
Management
• There is no gold standard for diagnosis.
• Decision for shunting is based on clinical impression with supportive
evidence from radiology and some of the following:
• Timed walking test before and after removing 30 mL of CSF at LP
• Cranial bolt monitoring over 24 hours showing 15B-waves
• Measuring the rate of absorption of CSF by infusion of saline
into the thecal sac, which represents compliance of the CSF
compartments. Normal value 5–10 mmHg/mL/min. More than
18 mmHg/mL/min implies active hydrocephalus.

COMPLICATIONS OF SHUNTS

Complications of shunts
Shunt infection
Usually caused by coagulase-negative Staphylococcus aureus. Ninety percent present within 3 months of insertion.
Clinical features
• General malaise
• Pyrexia
• Headache, vomiting, meningism
• Abdominal tenderness or distension
• Pain and erythema around the shunt
Laboratory features
• Increased C-reactive protein
• Increased white cell count
Management
• Shunt removal
• Placement of an external ventricular drain
• Intrathecal vancomycin for 5–7 days via external ventricular drain
(EVD): 5 mg if slit ventricles, 10 mg for normal ventricles, and 15 mg if
dilated ventricles daily when CSF draining freely or every 3 days when
drain clamped

Other complications
• Misplacement
• Hemorrhage
• Subdural hematomas can occur in the first 6 months especially in the
elderly. Ten to fifteen percent may require surgery.
• Epilepsy. See DVLA regulations. May not drive for 6 months
• Shunt malfunction
• Blockage at ventricular, distal, or valve level. Palpation of the shunt
reservoir is unreliable.
• Underdrainage: symptoms of hydrocephalus persist. Requires
placement of a valve with lower pressure variety
• Overdrainage: symptoms of low pressure, i.e., postural headache,
dizziness, tinnitus. Imaging reveals slit-like ventricles, subdural fluid
collections, dural thickening, and enhancement. Replace with a
higher pressure valve

Follow-up of patients with shunts
• Baseline CT 6 months after insertion
• Patient and caregivers should be given instructions about symptoms of
infection and blockage.
• Documentation about type of valve should be given to the patient.
• Programmable valves should be checked after MRI.

CHAPTER 15

Clinical neurophysiology

Neurophysiological investigations include the following:
• Electroencephalography (EEG)
• Used in diagnosis and management of epilepsy
• Combined with video recordings to establish diagnosis of epilepsy
• Assessment of epilepsy before epilepsy surgery
• Diagnosis of infective and metabolic brain disorders, e.g., CJD,
herpes simplex encephalitis, hepatic encephalopathy
• Nerve conduction studies (NCS) and needle electromyography (EMG)
• Study of sensory and motor peripheral nerve disorders,
e.g., neuropathies, radiculopathies, plexopathies, dorsal root
ganglionopathies, and anterior horn cell disorders
• Neuromuscular junction disorders
• Skeletal muscle disorders
• Cranial nerve disorders, e.g., facial nerve, trigeminal nerve
• Evoked potentials (EPs)
• Study sensory and motor pathways in the peripheral and central
nervous systems
• Useful in investigation of multiple sclerosis, other spinal cord and
brainstem disorders, and cranial neuropathies
• Monitoring of spinal cord function during surgery for scoliosis and
of the facial nerve during acoustic neuroma surgery
The neurophysiological evaluation helps the neurologist in the following
ways:
• Confirming the clinical diagnosis
• Defining type of dysfunction, e.g., axonal versus demyelinating
neuropathy
• Excluding certain disorders in differential diagnosis
• Detecting subclinical disease, e.g., optic nerve demyelination or
vasculitic peripheral neuropathy
• Defining severity of disease and indicating prognosis, e.g., extent of
axonal degeneration in Guillain–Barré syndrome
• Monitoring change in disease over time
• Identifying muscles most suitable for injection with botulinum toxin in
treating focal dystonias

Electroencephalography (EEG):
introduction
Conventional EEGs are noninvasive recordings of spontaneous brain electrical activity, obtained using scalp electrodes that record rapidly changing
events. EEG waveforms represent spatiotemporal averages of synchronous
excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) and inhibitory postsynaptic
potentials (IPSPs) generated by cortical pyramidal cells (layers II, III, IV).

EEG electrode placement Most widely used is the standardized
“International 10/20 system,” which utilizes three bony landmarks of the
skull: nasion (bridge of the nose directly under the forehead), inion (bony

ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHY (EEG): INTRODUCTION

protuberance in the middle of the back of the head), and pre-auricular
point (depression of bone in front of the external auditory meatus). Disc
electrodes (metal disc or cup, with diameters of 4–10 mm) are placed on
the scalp and held by an adhesive conductive paste that holds the electrode in place and serves as an electrical contact.

EEG display EEG is typically represented as a graph of voltage (vertical
axis, y) versus time (horizontal axis, x). Recordings are displayed in various
combinations of channels called “montages.”
EEG activity The difference in electrical potential between two record-

ing electrodes generates a wave; a wave or sequence of waves represents
EEG activity. The form of the waves is typically classified based on several
important characteristics, such as morphology, repetition, frequency, amplitude, field of distribution, reactivity (such as eye opening/closure, applied
noxious stimuli), and persistence. The frequency of EEG activity is classified into four bands: delta (up to 4/second or 4 Hz), theta (4–8/second or
4–8 Hz), alpha (8–13/second or 8–13 Hz), and beta (>13/second or >13
Hz) frequencies. The normal waking EEG (Fig. 15.1) in an adult usually has
posterior dominant bilateral alpha activity that is enhanced on eye closure.
The background frequency for most young children is 6 Hz by 1 year of
age, 7 Hz by 2 years of age, and 8 Hz by 3 years of age. The lower limit of
the alpha frequency band is reached by 8 years of age.

EEG recording
The routine EEG recording includes the following:
• Twenty-one scalp electrodes placed according to the International
10/20 system of electrode placement
• Simultaneous single-channel ECG recording
• Two eye movement channels monitor state of alertness or eye
movements during various stages of sleep (such as rapid eye
movements during sleep).
EEG recordings are susceptible to artifacts (noncerebral signals in origin).
These can be divided into physiological (generated by various body activities, such as muscle, movement, blinking) and nonphysiological (arising from
either external electrical interference or electrical malfunctioning of the
recording system). They are often technically difficult in younger children,
uncooperative patients, and in ICUs (due to electrical interference with
power lines and equipment). See Fig. 15.1.
Routine EEGs are usually initially recorded in the waking state. The
recording room is quiet and dimly lit to allow the patient to become
drowsy. Activation procedures may enhance abnormalities. These include
the following:
• Hyperventilation: vigorous overbreathing for 2–5 minutes, followed
by recording for at least 1 minute. This is contraindicated in patients
with various heart and lung conditions, cerebrovascular diseases
with poor or borderline cerebral perfusion, as well as acute cerebral
disorders (recent stroke, subarachnoid hemorrhage). With adequate
effort, normal responses are characterized by slow waves, usually in the
theta to delta range. The slowing (delta range, high amplitude) is most

ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHY (EEG): INTRODUCTION

pronounced in children and more prominent in persons with lower
serum glucose. This is especially useful in childhood absence epilepsy, as
lack of epileptiform abnormality virtually excludes the diagnosis in an
untreated patient. Less often, this maneuver activates focal epileptiform
patterns and focal slow waves.
• Photic stimulation: delivered by a strobe light (flashing light at
variable rates) 20–30 cm from the patient’s central vision. Flash
frequencies between 2 and 60/second are used, including during
eye closure, in a room with low illumination. Photosensitivity is
manifested by generalized self-sustaining epileptiform abnormalities.
The photoparoxysmal (photoepileptiform, photoconvulsive) response
consists of generalized or posterior dominant spike and slow-wave
(epileptiform) discharges. Generalized epileptiform activity that is
independent of the photic stimulus and outlasts its termination is
typically associated with increased risk of seizures. Normal photic
responses consist of sharp discharges time-locked to the stimulus rate
and ending with cessation of stimulation. The presence of a generalized
photoparoxysmal response is strong evidence of an underlying primary
generalized epilepsy (e.g., juvenile myoclonic epilepsy).
• Sleep deprivation: usually requires sleep deprivation for up to 24 hours,
which may activate epileptiform activity in susceptible individuals

Long-term EEG monitoring
Prolonged simultaneous video and EEG monitoring records behavior and
can capture epileptic events, contributing to the classification of seizure
disorders.
• Indicated in differentiating epileptic seizures from nonepileptic events
• Essential in presurgical evaluation to help identify the anatomical site of
seizure onset
May involve the following:
• Additional anterior temporal, sphenoidal (flexible wire with uninsulated
tip placed near the sphenoidal wing to detect activity in the temporal
lobes), or foramen ovale electrodes
• More invasive EEG recordings with subdural strip or intracerebral depth
electrodes (intracranial EEG studies) to localize epileptiform activity
• Stimulation of underlying cortex via subdural electrodes in waking
state by applying an electrical current to individual electrodes; used to
map the location of eloquent areas (those important for speech) prior
to resection
• Ambulatory 16- to 32-channel systems allowing the patient to perform
daily activities while trying to capture the clinical event in question.
Limitations due to artifacts and lack of simultaneous video recordings;
useful in cases where spells only occur in certain circumstances

385

386

CHAPTER 15

Clinical neurophysiology

EEG: use and abuse
EEG is useful in the investigation of the following:
• Epilepsy: epileptiform abnormality on EEG is specific but not sensitive
for the diagnosis of epilepsy as a cause of any paroxysmal event or
transient loss of consciousness. In epileptic patients sensitivity is
25%–55% and specificity is 80%–98%.
• Impaired consciousness/coma—to rule out subclinical seizures or
nonconvulsive status epilepticus
• Toxic confusional states
• Diffuse degenerative disorders, e.g., CJD, AD
• Metabolic encephalopathies, e.g., hepatic failure, uremia
• Cerebral trauma
• Parasomnias—episodes of unusual behaviors during sleep such as night
terrors, sleepwalking, REM sleep behavior disorder
EEG has more limited value in the workup and diagnosis of other conditions such as multiple sclerosis, migraine headaches, mental retardation and
psychoses, although abnormalities or even seizures have been described in
association with all of these conditions.
EEG abnormalities that indicate definite pathology:
• Epileptiform discharges
• Generalized or focal slowing
• Absence of normal background rhythms—diffuse or focal/unilateral
• Periodic phenomena: relatively stereotyped waveforms (often sharp
waves) that appear in a periodic or quasi-periodic fashion; commonly
seen in diffuse encephalopathies.

Contraindications
• Should not be used to rule out nonconvulsive status in patients who
are able to answer questions and follow commands
• A normal EEG does not exclude the diagnosis of epilepsy; cannot rule
it out unless the event in question is recorded during the EEG

EEG: normal rhythms and benign
variants
Normal rhythms
• Alpha rhythm: 8–13 Hz waves seen maximally over the bilateral
posterior head regions during relaxed wakefulness and with eye
closure; lower limit of this frequency should be reached by 8 years of
age; attenuates with eye opening and periods of alertness
• Beta rhythm: Faster frequencies, usually in the 13–25 Hz band,
maximum seen over the bi-fronto-central regions. Enhanced by
drowsiness; when of higher amplitude and more widespread, diffuse
distribution is secondary to medication (sedative-hypnotic) effect

EEG: NORMAL RHYTHMS AND BENIGN VARIANTS

• Mu rhythm: 7–12 Hz centrally located rhythm, arciform morphology,
attenuated unilaterally with movement of the opposite extremity; also
called “ubiquitous rhythm of the sensorimotor cortex at rest”
• Theta rhythm: 4–7 Hz activity, activated diffusely during drowsiness
• Posterior slow waves of youth: delta waves (1–3 Hz) with
superimposed alpha activity, observed maximally over the posterior
head regions; most common in children and adolescents, rarely in up to
20% of young adults

Benign variants
These include variations of normal rhythms and patterns with an apparent
“epileptiform” morphology, which should be properly recognized and differentiated from patterns with an abnormal significance.
• Rhythmic midtemporal theta of drowsiness (psychomotor variant):
bursts of rhythmic theta range waves, 5–7 Hz, often with a notched
appearance, commonly seen during drowsiness and stage 2 sleep, in
normal adolescents and adults
• Subclinical rhythmic electrographic discharge in adults (SREDA):
rhythmic 5–7 Hz theta activity, seen bilaterally and synchronously over
the parietal and posterior temporal regions, with an average duration
of 40–80 seconds; primarily seen in adults over age 50 years
• Midline theta rhythm (Ciganek rhythm): rhythmic sharply contoured
4–7 Hz theta activity, occurring usually over the midline region, during
wakefulness and drowsiness
• Frontal arousal rhythm (FAR): bursts of several second duration 7–10
Hz waves, maximally over the frontal head regions; disappears when
patient is fully awake
• Fourteen- and 6-Hz positive bursts: short trains of arch-shaped
waveforms with alternating positive spiky component and a negative
rounded waveform resembling a sleep spindle; occur at a rate of either
14 Hz or 6 Hz; seen in children and adolescent age groups during
drowsiness
• Small sharp spikes (benign epileptiform transients of sleep, BETS): low
voltage, short duration (<50 milliseconds), single spike; no prominent
subsequent slow wave typically seen in epileptiform discharges; do not
occur in trains; seen in adults during drowsiness
• Six-hertz spike-and-wave bursts (“phantom spike and wave”): brief
bursts of 5–7 Hz generalized spike and wave discharges seen in
adolescents and young adults during wakefulness and drowsiness; the
spike component is characteristically small in amplitude; FOLD variant:
female, occipital region, low in amplitude, drowsiness; WHAM variant:
wakefulness, higher amplitude, anterior distribution, males
• Wicket spikes: intermittent trains or clusters of arciform waveforms
that resemble the Greek mu or wicket; seen predominantly in adults
over 30 years of age
• Breach rhythm: high voltage, spiky appearance activity in the region of
a skull defect

387

388

CHAPTER 15

Clinical neurophysiology

EEG: abnormal rhythms
Cortical rhythms are generated locally in the cerebral cortex but are modulated at both thalamic and reticular activating system (brainstem) levels.
Sleep spindles are likely generated in the thalamus (reticular nucleus) and
projected to the cortex. The reticular activating system is involved in the
transitions between different states of arousal.

Diffuse slowing
• Most common EEG abnormality, nonspecific as to cause
• Seen in various encephalopathies, such as toxic, metabolic, anoxic, and
degenerative conditions
• May be intermittent, intermittent rhythmic, continuous

Focal slowing
• Indicative of localized, parenchymal (white matter) dysfunction
• May be seen in patients with focal seizure disorders, even in the
absence of an underlying structural lesion
• Focal voltage attenuation suggests gray matter dysfunction, as well as
regional fluid collections (subdural, epidural)
• Persistent, nearly continuous delta waves are usually an indication of an
underlying white matter structural abnormality (Fig. 15.2C), or may be
seen postictally

Periodic complexes
Periodicity refers to repetitive discharges reflecting dysfunction of gray
and white matter
• Periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges (PLEDS; see Fig. 15.2A):
complex of spikes and slow wave discharges, at 1 to 2 Hz frequency;
most commonly seen in acute cerebral infarctions (35%), infections
(HSE), other mass lesions (e.g., metastases), cerebral abscess, anoxia;
highly correlated with seizures. Tend to resolve after 1 or 2 weeks,
even when underlying lesion is progressive
• See “Viral meningoencephalitis,” p. 297
• May be seen bilaterally independent (BIPLEDS), most often
associated with anoxic encephalopathy and central nervous system
infections; poor prognosis
• Generalized periodic discharges occur in
• Cerebral anoxia
• Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE): simultaneous bilateral
complexes of slow and fast components, repeating at 4–10 second
intervals
• Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease (CJD; Fig. 15.2B): discharges at frequency
close to 1 per second; may be confused with ECG pickup on scalp,
and simultaneous ECG channel is important
• In both SSPE and CJD: progressive loss of cortical rhythms until
repetitive complexes occur on a silent background

CHAPTER 15

Clinical neurophysiology

EEG and epilepsy
Epileptiform activity
The hallmarks are as follows:
• Spikes with 20–70 ms duration
• Sharp waves with 70–200 ms duration
• Spike and slow-wave activity or sharp and slow-wave activity
• Electrographic seizures, with or without clinical correlate
• However, similar patterns can occur in the normal EEG but are
recognized by the characteristic waveforms, topography, and
circumstances of occurrence (see “EEG-Benign Variants”)

Diagnostic strategy in epilepsy
• Misinterpretation of nonepileptiform features is an important cause
of false-positive EEG reports. Prevalence of rigorously defined
epileptiform discharges (EDs) is 0.5%–2% in normal adults.
• A normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.
• Thirty-three percent of epileptic patients exhibit interictal epileptiform
discharges in waking EEGs (Fig. 15.3A); 16% never do. The probability
of interictal epileptiform abnormality in a patient with epilepsy in a
30-minute waking recording is 1 in 3.
• Repeated waking EEGs can increase detection rate of interictal
epileptiform abnormalities in patients with epilepsy; EDs are recorded
on the first EEG in 30%–50% of patients with epilepsy, and in 60%–90%
by the third EEG.
• Sleep EEG, particularly following sleep deprivation (Fig. 15.3B),
increases yield to 80%; hyperventilation and photic stimulation also
increase probability of focal or generalized interictal epileptiform
abnormalities.
• If interictal EEG is persistently normal, consider long-term video–EEG
monitoring.
• There is no relationship between presence or absence of interictal
epileptiform abnormalities on EEG and seizure frequency or response
to medication.

EEG and seizure classification
• EEG findings together with patient’s clinical history support distinction
between focal and generalized seizures. This will guide therapy.
Identification of focal elements at onset of seizures is important,
as focal events can rapidly propagate to secondarily generalized
discharges.
• Focal asymmetry, slowing, or generalized abnormalities may assist in
differentiation.
• Photosensitivity occurs in 5% of epileptic patients, but more so in
the generalized epilepsy syndromes, especially in juvenile myoclonic
epilepsy. See Figure 15.3C.

CHAPTER 15

Clinical neurophysiology

EEG and discontinuation of treatment
In children and adults EEG can be a useful guide, as persistent epileptiform
abnormalities indicate a high risk of relapse if discontinuation of treatment
is under consideration. In certain benign epilepsy syndromes and benign
generalized epilepsy syndromes, EEG may still be abnormal, but treatment
can be discontinued. By the same token, patients may have a normal EEG,
but it can be too risky to discontinue treatment.

EEG and diffuse cerebral dysfunction
EEGs can be helpful in patients with altered mental status, ranging from
mild memory difficulties to coma. The results, however, are nonspecific as
to etiology. EEG is useful in the following clinical situations:
• Detection of seizure activity in a comatose patient
• Suggesting etiology in undiagnosed coma
• May reveal focal abnormalities from intracerebral space-occupying
lesions
• Periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges (PLEDS) over the
temporal region can suggest herpes simplex encephalitis
• Diagnosing diffuse degenerative conditions, e.g., CJD, SSPE
• Help in identification of psychogenic coma or the locked-in syndrome
• Prognostic guide after anoxic brain injury
• Evaluation of brain death

EEG patterns in diffuse cerebral dysfunction
Generalized slowing (Fig. 15.4)
• Can suggest toxic or metabolic encephalopathy
• Sensory activation using visual, auditory, tactile, or painful stimuli is
important, as reactive EEG activity implies a better prognosis.
Periodic spiking occurs in post-anoxic encephalopathy and is associated
with a poor prognosis.
Alpha coma Nonreactive 8–12/second activity is associated with a poor
prognosis.
Burst suppression
• Bursts of high-amplitude slow and sharp activity alternating with
periods of attenuation of background EEG activity
• May occur after severe anoxic brain injury, general anesthesia,
hypothermia, and barbiturate overdose
• Used as a marker of adequate barbiturate dosage in status epilepticus
treatment
Triphasic waves. Can occur in the following:
• Metabolic conditions: hepatic, uremic, and anoxic encephalopathy
• CJD
• Postictal state

CHAPTER 15

Clinical neurophysiology

Periodic complexes
• Periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges (PLEDS) occur in
destructive lesions: ischemic stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage,
encephalitis
• Generalized or asymmetrical periodic sharp waves often found in
sporadic CJD at some stage of the illness; do not occur in variant CJD
or familial CJD
• Generalized periodic stereotypic complexes occur in SSPE and
correlate with myoclonic jerking
Epileptiform patterns
• Nonconvulsive status epilepticus
• Postictal
Normal EEG
• Locked-in syndrome with lesion in pontine tegmentum
• Psychogenic unresponsiveness

• Absence of brain waves >2 µV amplitude
In brain death, severe poisoning, general anesthesia, hypothermia.

EEG in the intensive care unit
Clinical neurological assessment is limited in the unconscious or paralyzed
and ventilated patient. EEG can provide important information about cerebral function, particularly in detecting potentially remediable disorders.
EEG is sensitive to ischemia and hypoxia (pyramidal neurons in cortical
layers 3 and 5 are both responsible for EEG activity generation and vulnerable to hypoxia and ischemia). EEG abnormalities need to be distinguished
from the effects of sedatives and anesthetic agents.

399

400

CHAPTER 15

Clinical neurophysiology

Continuous EEG monitoring is used:
• To detect seizures in patients with status epilepticus or nonconvulsive
seizures who are paralyzed and ventilated; without continuous EEG
monitoring, diagnosis and treatment of nonconvulsive seizures and
status epilepticus may be delayed
• To assist management of sedation and increased ICP in patients
following acute severe head trauma; if increased ICP cannot be
controlled with conventional measures, high-dose barbiturate has been
proven to be effective in lowering it; continuous EEG monitoring is the
only reliable guide to monitoring barbiturate dosing, which is typically
titrated to burst-suppression pattern on EEG
• In assessment and early identification of hemispheric infarctions; CT
scans often can be normal or equivocal in acute stroke; however,
EEG changes occur within minutes of onset of ischemia, which has
important diagnostic and therapeutic implications
• In the diagnosis and prognosis of coma (Fig. 15.5) changes in reactivity,
variability, and wake–sleep state in the EEG may provide clues to the
etiology of coma.
• Focal repetitive periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges (PLEDS)
are typically seen in herpes simplex encephalitis.
• Diffuse slow waves occur in metabolic encephalopathy, anoxic brain
injury, drug overdose
• Spindle or beta coma patterns can be seen in overdoses with
tricyclic agents, benzodiazepines, barbiturates
• Alpha coma is typically seen in patients with severe anoxic
encephalopathy and is characterized by a diffusely distributed alpha
activity, nonreactive to external stimuli

Prognosis after cardiac arrest
• Recovery of continuous activity within first 4 hours correlates with
good prognosis. In contrast, recovery at 48 hours indicates poor
prognosis.
• Isoelectric and burst suppression patterns not caused by drugs or
hypothermia indicate a poor prognosis as well.

CHAPTER 15

Clinical neurophysiology

Technical summary of nerve conduction
studies (NCS)
Standard NCS assess function of the large myelinated motor and sensory
fibers.
• NCS depend on many technical factors
• Subject’s age, gender, and height
• Skin temperature: must be controlled or a correction applied;
conduction velocity varies by 2.4 m/s/1 degree from 29°C to 38°C
• Recording equipment
• Operator experience
• NCS are either
• Orthodromic where direction of propagated potentials is the same
as normal physiological conduction in the nerve, e.g., sensory nerve
distal-to-proximal
• Antidromic where studies are in the opposite direction to normal
physiological conduction, e.g., sensory nerve proximal-to-distal
• Conduction velocity (CV) reflects the velocity of the fastest conducting
nerve fibers.
• Durations of the sensory nerve action potential (SNAP) or compound
muscle action potential (CMAP) waveforms reveal the spectrum of CV
in large nerves (Fig. 15.6).
• Motor conduction velocity (MCV) in meters/second is calculated by:
distance (millimeters) between two separate points of stimulation, one
close to muscle being recorded, the other more proximal ÷ difference
between onset latencies of the proximally elicited and distally elicited
CMAP waveforms elicited by separate supramaximal stimulation
(milliseconds).
• Compound muscle action potentials (CMAPs) are recorded from the
skin overlying a muscle in response to stimulation of the motor nerve to
that muscle. Onset latency, amplitude, area, and duration are measured.
• Sensory nerve action potentials (SNAPs) are recorded from a nerve
in response to supramaximal stimulation of the nerve at another
site. Onset latency, peak latency, amplitude, area, and duration are
measured.
• Sensory conduction velocity (SCV) is calculated: distance (millimeters)
between stimulation and recording electrodes ÷ onset latency of the
SNAP waveform (milliseconds).
• F wave. Supramaximal distal stimulation of a motor nerve also elicits
an impulse that travels antidromically to the axon hillock region of the
spinal cord where it elicits further motor fibers that propagate back to
the muscle. Only explores 1%–3% of motor axons in a nerve
• Gives information on conduction over the whole length of motor
nerve, including proximal sections
• Parameters noted are frequency of occurrence out of 20 stimuli,
minimum latency and range of latencies.
• H reflex
• Measures conduction through afferent and efferent fibers in a
monosynaptic reflex arc

• Usually recorded from calf muscles in response to submaximal
stimulation of Ia afferents in the tibial nerve at the knee
• Equivalent to eliciting ankle deep tendon reflex
• Most helpful in assessing for S1 radiculopathy
• Absent if F wave and other NCS are abnormal
• Blink reflex
Assesses integrity of trigeminal and facial nerves and their direct and indirect connections in the pons and medulla

Evaluation of proximal nerve conduction
Indirect studies
• F wave
• H reflex
Direct studies
• Nerve root stimulation by
• High-voltage surface electrical stimulation
• Monopolar needle electrode stimulation
• Magnetic stimulation

Special studies
Repetitive nerve stimulation (RNS)
• Slow RNS: 4–10 impulses at rate of 3/sec: assesses neuromuscular
junction
• Decremental response with nadir at fourth impulse seen
characteristically in myasthenia gravis, botulism; may also be seen in
Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) and some congenital
myasthenic syndromes as well as in reinnervating muscle.
• Fast RNS: 1 second of stimulation at rate of 20–50 pulses/sec
• Incremental response seen LEMS and botulism; most pronounced
in LEMS

CHAPTER 15

Clinical neurophysiology

Peripheral nerve disorders: NCS
abnormalities
NCS will help classify a peripheral nerve disorder into the following
categories:
• Sensorimotor
• Pure sensory or pure motor
• Axonal, demyelinating, or mixed
• Generalized, multifocal, or length dependent

Demyelinating neuropathies
Characterized by decreased conduction velocities with preserved SNAP
and CMAP amplitudes.
• Abnormalities supportive of demyelinating neuropathy include
• Dec CV: <70%–80% of lower limit of normal
• Increased F wave latencies: >130% upper limit of normal
• Increased distal sensory and motor latencies: >130% upper limit of
normal
• Decreased CMAP amplitude from proximal stimulation compared
to distal stimulation (motor conduction block): 20%–50% decrease
required depending on distance from stimulation to recording
electrode (smaller percent decrease with shorter distance)
• In many hereditary demyelinating neuropathies, abnormalities tend to
be diffuse and to a similar degree in all nerves.
• In acquired demyelinating neuropathies
• Focal slowing
• Temporal dispersion (increased duration of action potentials)
• Regions of conduction block
• Needle EMG studies can show abnormalities indicating secondary
denervation and reinnervation, depending on severity and chronicity.

Axonal neuropathies
Characterized by:
• Decreased or unrecordable SNAPs and CMAPs
• With severe axonal loss, conduction velocity may be reduced as result
of loss of fastest conducting fibers
• Needle EMG confirms axonal degeneration
• Spontaneous activity (positive sharp waves and fibrillations) in a
quiet muscle denotes denervation and can suggest acuity of insult.
• Examination of voluntary motor units with needle examination may
reveal characteristic features of denervation and reinnervation.

Focal neuropathies (See Fig. 15.7.)
• Lesions may cause focal regions of demyelination. Stimulation of the
nerve distal to lesion elicits a normal response. Proximal stimulation
produces a response with delayed latency corresponding to localized
conduction slowing, e.g., ulnar neuropathy at the elbow. Inching studies
(in which stimulating electrode is moved in 1 cm increments away
from or toward the recording electrode) and comparative studies may
localize precise site of demyelination (Fig. 15.7)

fibers from digit IV. (Active stimulating-to-recording electrode distances equal for the
three active recording electrode positions.)

• Focal lesion may result in conduction block at the site of the lesion. For
example, with neurapraxia of the common peroneal nerve at the fibular
head resulting in foot-drop, distal response may be normal but proximal
stimulation may not elicit a response due to conduction block.
• Focal lesion may also cause axonal degeneration distal to site of lesion.
This can result in reduced amplitude of SNAPs and CMAPs.

CHAPTER 15

Clinical neurophysiology

Technical summary of needle
electromyography (EMG)
Needle EMG involves extracellular recording of muscle action potentials
using either monopolar or concentric needle electrodes. In typical clinical
practice, needle EMG is a qualitative assessment and therefore operator
dependent.
• A motor unit refers to the a single anterior horn cell body, its axon,
terminal axon branches, and all subsequently innervated muscle fibers
(10–2000 muscle fibers per anterior horn cell, depending on the
muscle type).
• A motor unit action potential (MUAP) is the summation of activity
from all of the muscle fibers of one motor unit.
• Transection of a motor nerve is followed by regrowth at 1 mm/day.

Technical aspects
• Concentric needle electrode (CNE) is inserted into the belly of the
muscle at rest
• Insertional activity is assessed. No electrical activity should be seen in a
normal muscle at rest other than that generated by needle insertion.
• An exception to this rule occurs when the needle touches or is in
close proximity to a motor end plate. In that event, a characteristic
“sea shore” sound may be heard and irregular small spikes or even
positive sharp waves may be seen.
• Subject is asked to activate muscle voluntarily. MUAPs are studied and
reflect synchronous discharge of all muscle fibers in a motor unit.
• With minimal effort, a few motor units fire initially at 5–7/sec. With
more effort, more motor units of higher amplitude and faster firing
frequencies are recruited.
• During minimal effort, individual MUAPs are assessed for morphology,
including amplitude, phases and duration (see Fig. 15.8).
• Recruitment and interference pattern of MUAPs are assessed at
increasing levels of contraction and at maximal voluntary effort.

Special studies
Single-fiber EMG (SFEMG) utilizes a special needle with two apertures to
record two or more muscle fibers of the same motor unit firing nearly
synchronously.
• Measures synchrony of activation (jitter) and detects failure of a muscle
fiber to fire (blocking) within a motor unit
• Sensitive for detecting neuromuscular junction defects
• Also “positive” in floridly active denervation
• Allows estimation of fiber density in cases of denervation

Notes
• Needle EMG may be contraindicated in patients with coagulopathies,
e.g., oral anticoagulant medication, hemophilia, thrombocytopenia.
Discuss with clinical neurophysiologist.
• Transient bacteremia may occur, causing endocarditis in those with
prosthetic or diseased valves. Discuss with clinical neurophysiologist.

• Serum creatine kinase (CK) levels may rise by 150% of normal after

End plate noise (see Fig. 15.9)
• Multiple small negative monophasic potentials—associated with sound

• Reflect miniature endplate potentials (MEPPs)—the spontaneous
“leakage” of quanta of acetylcholine from the presynaptic membrane at
the motor endplate, which results in depolarizations at the postsynaptic
membrane that do not reach a level to propagate an action potential
End plate spikes (see Fig. 15.9)
• Irregular biphasic negative potentials of low amplitude representing
depolarization of a single muscle fiber—attributed to the needle
touching terminal axon twigs
Insertional activity (see Fig. 15.10)
• Essentially injury potentials caused by damage to muscle membranes by
needle. Normal insertional activity lasts less than 300 milliseconds after
a needle movement.

Voluntary MUAPs

Triphasic potentials (see Fig. 15.11)
• Smallest motor units recruited first

Smallest motor units recruited first followed by larger motor units for gradation
of power.

• Recruitment ratio <5 (frequency of firing of fastest-firing motor unit
divided by total number of motor units firing). Values >5 support
motor neuron loss.
• Type I fibers (oxidative) recruited first; Type II fibers (glycolytic)
recruited last

Needle EMG: patterns of abnormality

• Myopathic processes
• Chemodenervation, e.g., botulism
Fasciculation potentials
• Result from irregular spontaneous discharges of a group of muscle
fibers from all or part of a motor unit
• May result from pathology in the anterior horn cell, motor root, or
more distal motor nerve
• May also be a benign condition exacerbated by fatigue and stimulants
Myotonia (see Fig. 15.13)
• Characterized by rhythmic discharges of muscle fibers occurring
spontaneously or triggered by insertion of EMG needle into muscle.

• Polymyositis
• Hypothyroidism

• Have a uniform shape, frequency, and amplitude. Have an abrupt onset,
mimicking the sound of a machine gun, with a frequency of 5–100/sec
• Represent a group of muscle fibers firing in near synchrony through
fiber-to-fiber ephaptic transmission (“circus rhythm”: depolarization of
one muscle fiber causes the depolarization of adjacent fiber)

fibers

• Myxedema
Neuromyotonia (see Fig. 15.13)
• Characterized by spontaneous and continuous rhythmical discharges at

• Occurs in conditions associated with continuous muscle fiber activity,
e.g., stiff person syndrome, encephalomyelitis with rigidity, Isaac
(autoimmune) syndrome, anticholinesterase poisoning, chronic spinal
muscular atrophy, intraoperative nerve irritation
Myokymia (see Fig. 15.13)
• Consists of repetitive discharges of one or more motor units, usually in
complex bursts
• Occurs in chronic neuropathies and represents a nonspecific response
to injury
• Occurs in radiation plexopathies
• Can be recorded in facial muscles in patients with multiple sclerosis or
pontine glioma
• May be exacerbated by hyperventilation-induced hypocalcemia

Neurogenic processes (affecting motor axons)
• Denervation results in fewer motor units that can be activated
voluntarily. Remaining viable motor units may reinnervate those muscle
fibers that have lost their prior axonal connections.

NEEDLE EMG: PATTERNS OF ABNORMALITY

• Acute denervation changes recorded from a muscle at rest initially
include spontaneous fibrillations and positive sharp waves as the
muscle membrane loses stability.
• Reinnervation results in denser motor units that contain increased
numbers of fibers manifesting as long-duration high-amplitude MUAPs.
Motor unit fiber density is increased; grouping of fibers of similar type
occurs. Newly reinnervated MUAPs are unstable (Fig. 15.14), reflected
in their changing morphology on needle examination.

unstable and irregular motor unit potential, indicating recent reinnervation.

CHAPTER 15

Clinical neurophysiology

Myopathic processes
• Excessively full interference pattern so that baseline is obliterated at
earlier effort than in normal muscle
• Low-amplitude and short-duration MUAPs
• Complex or polyphasic MUAPs due to increased variation in diameter
of pathological muscle fibers
• Fibrillations and positive sharp waves at rest in inflammatory and some
hereditary myopathies
• Unstable MUAPs indicate a recent or active process.
• Stable late satellite potentials may be present in longstanding
myopathic disorders.

NCS and needle EMG findings in
neuropathies
Axonal loss
NCS:
• Absent or low-amplitude sensory and/or motor responses
• Conduction velocities preserved (normal or in cases of severe axonal
loss >80% lower limit of normal)
Needle EMG:
• Acute: normal or decreased recruitment
• Subacute: decreased recruitment, increasing duration, amplitude and
polyphasia of MUAPs
• Chronic: high-amplitude, long-duration motor units with decreased
recruitment (recruitment ratio >5). With ongoing denervation,
polyphasic MUAPs are still seen.

Demyelination
• Hereditary
• NCS: prolonged latencies, slow conduction velocities, prolonged F
waves, no focal conduction block (except in hereditary neuropathy
with pressure palsies [HNPP]), a hereditary dysmyelination
syndrome in which compact structure of myelin is disrupted
as a result of duplication of PMP gene on chromosome 22;
conduction block is seen clinically at sites usually unassociated with
compression injuries
• Needle EMG: can be normal; however, secondary axonal loss over
years leads to chronic pattern of denervation (represented by largeamplitude, long-duration motor units with decreased recruitment in
distal limb muscles)

NCS AND NEEDLE EMG FINDINGS IN NEUROPATHIES

• Acquired (focal or generalized): Guillain-Barre syndrome is the
prototypical acquired demyelinating syndrome (see Box 15.1)
• NCS: prolonged latencies, slow conduction velocities, prolonged F
waves as seen in hereditary demyelinating neuropathies. However,
the pathognomic hallmark is presence of conduction block and
temporal dispersion.
• Needle EMG: normal +/– decreased recruitment in weak muscles
whose nerves are affected by conduction block. In chronic
demyelinating disorders, secondary axonal loss may occur resulting
in neurogenic MUAPs (see EMG in “Axonal loss” earlier).

Box 15.1 Guillain–Barré syndrome
• Prototypical acquired demyelinating syndrome
• Motor nerves usually more involved than sensory nerves
• Autonomic nerve involvement may be prominent and life-threatening
(labile blood pressure and cardiac arrythmias)
Early NCS
• Studies may be normal
• Prolonged distal motor latencies
• Reduced recruitment and prolonged F waves
• Early prolongation of F waves represents proximal conduction block.
Late NCS
• Widespread slowing in sensory and motor nerves
• Temporal dispersion of SNAP or CMAP
• Conduction block detected by decreased CMAP amplitude with
more proximal stimulation
Needle EMG
• Evidence of denervation in paraspinal and limb muscles 2–3 weeks
after onset indicates secondary motor axonal loss as a result of
primary demyelination.
• The degree of decreased CMAP amplitude and denervation on
needle EMG indicates severity and guides prognosis.
GBS subgroups
• Acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (AIDP)
• Acute motor axonal neuropathy (AMAN)
• Acute motor and sensory axonal neuropathy (AMSAM)
• Miller Fisher syndrome: areflexia, ataxia, and ophthalmoplegia

CHAPTER 15

Clinical neurophysiology

NCS and needle EMG findings in
plexopathies
The delineation of a plexopathy often requires an extensive electrophysiological study. Detailed knowledge of the brachial plexus in particular is necessary to localize a lesion within the plexus. The combination of abnormalities
on sensory and motor NCS and on needle EMG point to localization.

NCS
• Sensory NCS: may be abnormal and, if so, have localizing value
• Motor NCS—abnormalities narrow the possibilities of affected root,
trunk, or cord

Needle EMG
• Denervation +/– reinnervation seen in affected muscles

NCS and needle EMG findings in
radiculopathies
NCS
• Normal SNAPs, as pathology is proximal to the dorsal root ganglion.
• H-reflex from flexor carpi radialis or soleus muscles may be delayed or
absent in C7 or S1 radiculopathies, respectively.

Needle EMG
• Denervation of paraspinal muscles helps to differentiate root lesions
from more peripheral nerve lesions.
• Evidence of denervation is required in ≥2 muscles innervated by each
motor root.
• Needle EMG of adjacent myotomes determines extent of involvement.

NCS and needle EMG findings in motor
neuron disease (MND)
MND can be difficult to diagnose in the early stages, especially in bulbar
onset cases or if confined to one limb. The electrophysiological examination can support a clinical diagnosis of MND but is not itself diagnostic.

NCS
• Sensory NCS normal
• Motor NCS with decreased amplitude of CMAPs and normal
conduction velocities (axonal loss pattern)

Needle EMG
• Active denervation with partial reinnervation involving different roots and
nerves corresponding to different spinal and bulbar segments (Table 15.1)

• Presynaptic, e.g., Lambert–Eaton myasthenic syndrome, botulism
Note: it is important to study clinically affected muscles.

Myasthenia gravis
NCS
• Normal sensory nerve conduction studies
• Amplitude of CMAP from affected muscle may be decreased due to
motor endplate destruction with normal motor conduction velocities.
Needle EMG
• No evidence of denervation or reinnervation (except in severest
cases)
Repetitive nerve stimulation (RNS) (see Fig. 15.16)
• Slow rate of repetitive supramaximal stimulation (3/sec) results
in “decrement”: i.e., >10% decreased amplitude of fourth CMAP
compared to first CMAP
• Maximal voluntary contraction of the muscle for 20 seconds or a train
of high-rate stimulation (20–50/sec) may result in some increase in
CMAP amplitude (repair of decrement), but <200%: i.e., post-activation
potentiation due to transient increase in acetylcholine release.
• Degree of decrement correlates with clinical severity
Single-fiber EMG (SFEMG) (see Fig. 15.17)
• Studies transmission in individual motor endplates
• Performed if RNS is negative and clinical suspicion for neuromuscular
junction defect remains high
• Reveals subclinical neuromuscular transmission defects
• Increased jitter found in extensor digitorum communis muscle in all
cases of moderate or severe generalized MG and 96% of mild cases. In
ocular MG, increased jitter of frontalis muscle found in 89%

NCS
• Sensory nerve conduction studies are usually normal unless associated
with a paraneoplastic neuropathy.
• CMAP amplitudes are absent or decreased if rested muscle is tested.
• Normal motor conduction velocities
RNS (see Fig. 15.16)
• Slow rate of repetitive supramaximal stimulation (3/second) elicits a
decrement >10%, similar to MG above
• Maximal voluntary contraction for 20 seconds or high rate of RNS
(20–50/sec) results in >200% of CMAP post-activation potentiation
due to transient increased release of acetycholine. See Fig. 15.18.

CHAPTER 15

Clinical neurophysiology

Quantification of small-fiber
neuropathy
Pain and temperature perception
Painful neuropathies may develop without clear abnormalities on nerve
conduction studies or EMG. This is due to the involvement of small nerve
fibers dispersed diffusely in the skin. Patients often complain of burning or
stinging pain or electrical shocks. The most common cause of small-fiber
neuropathy is impaired glucose handling, though a number of autoimmune
and hereditary disorders are also associated with it, e.g., Sjogren disease,
amyloidosis. Often the diagnosis is made on a clinical basis without electrophysiological testing. In cases where confirmation is desired, the following
testing may be done:
• Skin biopsy to assess intraepidermal nerve fiber density
• Quantitative sensory testing (QST)
• Assesses threshold of heat and cold perception (small-fiber
function)
• Assesses threshold of vibratory perception (large-fiber function)

Autonomic function
Autonomic nerve dysfunction represents a type of small-fiber neuropathy.
Autonomic fibers are small in caliber, unmyelinated, and diffusely dispersed.
A number of specialized electrophysiological tests have been developed to
assess small-fiber autonomic function, many of which are only available in
specialized academic centers.
Routine cardiac autonomic testing might include the following:
• Tilt table testing
• Heart rate or blood pressure response to deep breathing
• Heart rate or blood pressure response to Valsalva maneuver
• Heart rate or blood pressure response to standing from the
recumbent position
More specialized testing might include the following:
• PET scan or more commonly SPECT scan with MIBG to elucidate
cardiac autonomic neuropathy (CAN)
• Thermoregulatory sweat testing (TST): assesses sweating response to a
warm environment
• Quantitative sudomotor axon reflex testing (QSART): measures
sympathetic skin response (sweat production) to direct application of
acetylcholine

Evoked potentials (EPs)
Introduction
In contrast with EEG, which is a reflection of spontaneous electrical
activity of the brain, evoked potentials (EPs) are generated by applied
external stimuli to sensory systems (visual, auditory, or somatosensory
evoked potentials) or motor pathways (motor evoked potentials). EPs

VISUAL EVOKED POTENTIALS (VEPS)

consist of complex of waveforms with positive and negative components.
Abnormalities of EPs include the following:
• Absence of the wave
• Increased wave latency
• Decreased wave amplitude

Clinical applications
• Demyelinating disorders
• Identify and localize abnormal sensory system function as an objective
measure in conjunction with the neurological examination
• Prognosis: abnormalities of the somatosensory evoked potentials in the
setting of hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy

Visual evoked potentials (VEPs)
VEPs are recorded from the scalp and are averaged from the EEG background of the occipital cortex. The visual stimulus is a checkerboard pattern of black and white squares that reverses (white squares change to
black and the black squares to white) one to three times per second.
VEPs reflect integrity of the central visual field from retina, optic nerve,
and cortex and are exquisitely sensitive to disorders of the optic nerves
and optic chiasm.
• The full-field VEP is elicited by stimulating each eye while the subject
fixates on the stimulus.
• Hemifield stimulation is helpful in assessment of postchiasmatic lesions.
• Pattern reversal electroretinography (ERG) can be recorded
simultaneously with VEPs; this enables retinal abnormalities to be
excluded as a cause of abnormal VEPs.
The P100, the major measurement and the most consistent waveform, is
a large positive deflection that occurs at approximately 100 milliseconds
after the visual stimulus and is maximal in the occipital midline.
• Latency is the most consistent parameter.
• Amplitude varies among normal individuals.
• Elicited by the following:
• Luminance change, i.e., flash VEP
• Contrast change with repeated reversal of the checkerboard
pattern (pattern reversal VEP; Fig. 15.19A)

Applications
Most commonly used for detection of asymptomatic lesions in MS
(Fig. 15.19B).
• Ninety percent of patients with a history of optic neuritis have
abnormal pattern-reversal VEPs; latency of the P100 response almost
always remains abnormally delayed, even if vision returns to normal.
• Seventy percent of patients with definite multiple sclerosis and no
history of optic neuritis have prolonged P100 latency.
• Unilateral delay suggests impaired conduction in the visual pathway
anterior to optic chiasm, since fibers arising from the nasal portion of
each retina decussate at the optic chiasm.

was 100 msec. (B) Delayed pattern-reversal VERs recorded from a 48-year-old man
with multiple sclerosis. The P100 latency indicated by arrow was 143 ms. (Visual
acuity was 6/9.)

SOMATOSENSORY EVOKED POTENTIALS (SSEPS)

• Site of abnormality cannot be localized when delay is bilateral and
equivalent from each eye (inter-eye P100 latency <6–8 msec).
• Unilateral hemispheric lesions do not alter the latency of the P100
response, given the normal response from the contralateral hemisphere.
• Possible to have recordable VEPs with cortical blindness (when an
island of striate cortex is spared in extensive parieto-occipital lesions)
• VEP delays have been described with a variety of other acute and
chronic diseases that affect the visual system: ocular diseases (e.g.,
glaucoma, retinopathies), compressive and noncompressive lesions of the
optic nerve (extrinsic tumors, ischemic optic neuritis), diffuse nervous
system diseases (adrenoleukodystrophies, spinocerebellar ataxias).
• Hysteria and malingering: a normal P100 latency makes lesions of the
optic nerve or anterior chiasm very unlikely as cause of subjective
visual loss.

Somatosensory evoked potentials
(SSEPs)
SSEPs are time-locked responses following electric stimulation of afferent
peripheral nerve fibers from upper (median nerve) and lower (posterior
tibial nerve) limbs. They enable study of the integrity of the large-fiber sensory pathways in peripheral nerves, spinal cord (dorsal column-meniscal
system), and brain.

Upper-limb SSEPs
• Stimulation of median nerve at wrist (Fig. 15.20A)
• Recordings from
• Erb’s point
• Upper cervical cord
• Scalp over hand area of contralateral somatosensory cortex
• Nomenclature
• EP waveforms are named according to their polarity (N-negative, by
convention upward deflection in SSEPs; P-positive)
• Generators
• EP (N9)—Erb’s point potential—afferent volley passing through the
brachial plexus
• N13—postsynaptic activity in the dorsal gray matter of the cervical
cord
• P14—activity in the caudal medial lemniscus, prior to decussation
• N18—postsynaptic potentials from multiple brainstem structures
• N20—activity from the contralateral primary cortical
somatosensory receiving area

Lower-limb SSEPs
• Stimulation of tibial nerve at ankle (Fig. 15.20B)
• Recordings from the following:
• PF—popliteal fossa
• T12/L1

SOMATOSENSORY EVOKED POTENTIALS (SSEPS)

• Scalp over foot/leg area of contralateral somatosensory cortex in
midline
• Generators
• PF—spinal roots, gracile tract
• N22—dorsal gray matter, at the lower thoracic/upper lumbar spine
level
• P31—activity in the caudal medial lemniscus
• N34—equivalent of N18 component of the median nerve SEP,
multiple brainstem structures
• P37—cortical component, contralateral primary somatosensory
area

Notes
• Lesions alter SSEPs by delaying or abolishing component waveforms.
Waveform amplitude is less reliable than latency.
• Lower-limb SSEP latencies are proportional to standing height.
• Differentiate between central and peripheral causes of large-fiber
sensory dysfunction
• Study proximal peripheral nerves when standard sensory NCS are
normal.
• Altered by focal (strokes, syringomyelia) or diffuse (multiple sclerosis,
hereditary system degenerations) processes
• Large-amplitude SSEPs, reflecting enhanced cortical excitability,
are seen in progressive myoclonic epilepsy, late-infantile ceroid
lipofuscinosis.
• Confirmation of nonorganic peripheral sensory loss
• Used to monitor spinal cord integrity during surgical procedures
associated with potential risk of injury

SSEPs in specific conditions
Multiple sclerosis
• SSEP abnormalities present in up to 90% of patients with definite MS
and 50%–60% of MS patients without sensory symptoms or signs.
• Usually associated with prolongation of central sensory latencies
• May indicate second asymptomatic lesion
• When peripheral sensory conduction is normal, it is possible to
localize a lesion:
• Above cervico–medullary junction
• At region of cervico–medullary junction/upper cervical cord
• Below upper cervical region but above cauda equina
Coma
• Bilateral absence of the thalamo-cortical (N18–N20) waveforms
indicates poor prognosis.
• Prognostic classification based on SSEPs has been developed for
posthypoxic coma.

CHAPTER 15

Clinical neurophysiology

Brain death
• The role of neurophysiological investigations in brainstem death
remains controversial.
• Absent N20–P22 waveforms
• P/N13 waveform complex is preserved in 70% of brain-dead patients.
Cortical myoclonus Back-averaging techniques show abnormally large
cortical waveforms in progressive myoclonic epilepsy, CJD, and posthypoxic myoclonus.

Brainstem auditory evoked potentials
(BAEPs)
BAEPs (Fig. 15.21) are elicited by “clicks” presented to the ear by a headphone and generated by the auditory nerve and the brainstem. Waveforms
are recorded between disc electrodes placed on the scalp at vertex and
mastoid of the ear being studied. The generated signals occur within 7
milliseconds after the stimulus. Normally 6 or 7 negative waveforms are
recorded. Latencies for waveforms I, III, and V are the most consistent and
important in clinical practice.
• Wave I. Generated in the peripheral portion of the auditory nerve
near cochlea
• Wave II. Generated in the ipsilateral dorsal and ventral cochlear nuclei
• Wave III. Generated in the superior olivary nucleus
• Wave IV. Generated in the lateral lemniscus
• Wave V. Generated in the inferior colliculus, i.e., upper pons/lower
midbrain
• In approximately one-third of cases, waves IV and V are fused into a
single wave/complex.
• Wave VI/VII. Generated in subcortical structures, such as the medial
geniculate and the auditory radiations
• Most sensitive measure is the wave I–wave III interwave latency
difference

Indications/clinical correlation
• Identifying hearing impairment in infancy or in patients who have
difficulty cooperating with conventional audiography
• Determining nature of hearing loss
• Helping diagnose acoustic neuroma: 98% with acoustic neuroma have
abnormal BAEPs; 33% have unrecordable BAEPs. Abnormalities include
prolongation of the I to III interpeak interval, preservation of wave I
with loss of the subsequent components, or loss of all waveforms (in
up to 33% of cases)

• Aiding diagnosis of multiple sclerosis: abnormal in 20%–50% of patients
who have no brainstem symptoms or signs; abnormal in up to 33%
of patients with confirmed diagnosis; most common abnormality is
decreased amplitude or absence of waves IV and V (>80% of cases);
increase in the I–V interpeak latency, absence of wave III, or no
response at all are other types of abnormalities.
• Aiding localization of brainstem pathology: delayed or absent wave V
with normal wave III indicates abnormal conduction in the auditory
pathways in the region of the pons
• Given their resistance to systemic metabolic abnormalities or
medications, BAEPs are useful for demonstrating brainstem integrity in
toxic and metabolic disturbances that alter EEG.
• Are usually normal in patients comatose as a result of a toxic or
metabolic etiology or with a diffuse cortical process that does not
affect the brainstem
Note: BAEPs are normal in cortical deafness.

CHAPTER 15

Clinical neurophysiology

Normal values in clinical
neurophysiology
• Nerve conduction and evoked potential data are influenced by many
subject variables, including age, height, skin temperature, and sex.
Normal values that approximate most lab standards are presented in
Tables 15.2, 15.3, and 15.4 as a point of reference.
• They can also be affected by technical factors such as electrode
specifications, stimulating and recording parameters, recording
equipment, and the person carrying out the study.
• Specific factors exist for particular studies, such as the importance of
visual acuity, check size, and luminance for pattern-reversal VEPs and
hearing threshold for BAEPs.

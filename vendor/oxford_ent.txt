Preface
This book is intended for the medical student, physician-in-training, or
Otolaryngology resident, or as a quick reference for the practitioner of
Otolaryngology. This volume is not meant to be encyclopedic, since the
breadth of Otolaryngology knowledge is so large.
Instead, it is meant to be a pocket book that can be an easy reference
for the student or practitioner. It covers common otolaryngologic disorders and is organized by anatomic site, disease entity, presentation, or
procedure. Current references are included for further reading and more
in-depth information. It is hoped that physicians and surgeons at all levels
will find this book valuable.
The authors would like to thank Kevin Kochanski, William Lamsback, and
Nancy Wolitzer, our developmental editors at Oxford University Press, for
all of their assistance in organizing this volume, and David Cognetti and
Berrylin Ferguson for their help in editing the manuscript. In addition,
we are indebted to Myung Song of Woodstock, New York, for her medical
illustrations in Chapter 16, on facial plastic surgery and reconstruction.

CHAPTER 1

Overview

Using this book
The purpose of this book is to provide concise, practical guidelines associated with treating disorders of the head and neck. We wish to provide
a basic fund of knowledge of Otolaryngology, with particular emphasis on
common ear, nose, and throat (ENT) problems. The breadth of Otolaryngology practice is so wide today that an attempt to be comprehensive
would be impossible, and for the sake of brevity, many of the subtleties
of clinical practice have been excluded here. As a reference book, the
Oxford Handbook is well organized and designed to be slipped inside the
pocket of a white coat for rapid consultation. It is suitable for the ward,
rounds, and clinic. In addition, we have included reference lists at the end
of each chapter that provide a more in-depth understanding of each
disorder.
The book is organized as a primer to Otolaryngology. It begins with a
description of the head and neck examination and history taking as
related to disorders of the head and neck. Unique for this type of book is
Chapter 3, “Common methods of presentation,” which is a guide for
dealing with patients as they present with symptoms in clinical practice.
It also provides a convenient way of accessing the relevant chapter in the
anatomical list. The bulk of the handbook is organized on the basis of
anatomic sites. The last several chapters are very helpful for describing
common surgical procedures used in Otolaryngology, ENT emergencies,
and common eponyms used.

OTOLARYNGOLOGY AS A SUBJECT AND CAREER 1

Otolaryngology as a subject and career
Otolaryngology is a fantastic specialty that is every bit as exciting in
practice as it is in theory. It is difficult to conceive of any specialty that can
provide such diversity in medical practice.
- ENT conditions make up 25%–50% of all general-practice consultations.
- ENT conditions affect people of all ages, from infants to the elderly.
- Outpatient work is about 50% of the workload. This gives a good
balance between surgical and medical practice.
- The major broad divisions of Otolaryngology and head and neck
surgery include otology and neurotology, rhinology, facial plastics and
reconstructive surgery, head and neck cancer surgery, laryngology,
allergy, and pediatric Otolaryngology.
- Surgical skills are broad, from microsurgery on the smallest bones in
the body to major head and neck reconstructive surgery.
- Otolaryngology offers enormous research potential, including nasal
polyps, congenital hearing loss, immunology, and genetics of cancer.
- Cutting-edge developments are occurring in Otolaryngology, such as
cochlear implantation, auditory brainstem implantation, and laser surgery. There is a constant evolution of surgical techniques and devices.

CHAPTER 1

Overview

Students and Otolaryngology
The subject of Otolaryngology can seem quite daunting to students.
This vast subject occupies a small part of the medical curriculum, and in
some instances has been dropped entirely from medical-school programs.
In strong contrast to the time given to the field in training, otolaryngological conditions make up between 25% and 50% of all generalpractice consultations. As a student, it is important to have a firm idea of
the important topics you want to cover in Otolaryngology. These will
form your learning aims and objectives—see the next section (p. 5).
There may be local variations.
Although you will find that Otolaryngology departments throughout
the world are welcoming to students, do not abuse their hospitality by
being late or discourteous. Professional conduct is important, whatever
the specialty you are studying.
There are particularly sensitive areas within Otolaryngology practice
that require special tact as a student. Two of these are head and neck
cancer and hearing problems.

Head and neck cancer
These cancers form an important part of the Otolaryngology workload.
You will need to be sensitive in dealing with these patients. They often have
unique problems associated with their disease and treatment including the
following:
- Poor communication
- Disfiguring surgery
- Depression
- Alcohol withdrawal

Hearing problems
The diagnosis of hearing loss in a child can be a devastating blow to
parents. You will need to be sensitive to this. Another cause of great
concern to parents is when a poorly performing child has a normal hearing
test, as this may confirm the diagnosis of global developmental delay.

CHAPTER 1

Overview

Research
In conducting research, it is important to learn how to ask a question,
establish a hypothesis and test it, and develop a database and conclusions
based on statistically sound results. Aim to produce at least one publication every 6 months. Don’t be distracted by trying to be involved in too
many projects at once.
Work in a team if you can, as collaboration is a valuable component to
your education. Don’t take on too many projects in a team—each team
member should take on one research project at a time. Ask senior colleagues about possible projects; affiliated university departments may be
helpful in this regard. Involve a statistician before undertaking research, as
this will often help turn an idea into a first-rate publication and avoid
unnecessary work. Always check local ethics committee guidelines before
you start.

CRITICAL APPRAISAL OF THE LITERATURE 1

Critical appraisal of the literature
Staying current and up to date in medical care requires the ability to
critically appraise the literature and to understand the methodology
required to produce clinically significant work. More clinical decisions are
being evaluated by outcomes and tested by clinical trials. Evidence-based
medicine (EBM) is based on the application of results of prospective,
controlled studies. It is important to understand the level of evidence
supported by our clinical decisions. Studies should be judged on both
internal validity (is the methodology used by the researchers valid?) and
external validity (does the study answer the question that you are asking?).
Questions to ask when assessing the strength of a clinical study:
1. How were the patients recruited, and what is the setting in which the
study took place?
2. Are the inclusion criteria appropriate and free of bias?
3. Are the treatment methods within the scope of general practice and
in keeping with the standard of care?
4. Are the outcome measures clinically important?
5. Is the follow-up greater than 80%?
6. Do the results and data support the conclusion?
The strength of different methodology and study designs in order of
importance:
1. Randomized, double-blind, controlled trials
2. Quasi-randomized controlled trials
3. Nonrandomized controlled trials
4. Cohort studies with appropriately matched controls
5. Retrospective trials
6. Case reports

CHAPTER 2

The ENT examination

Equipment
A full otolaryngologic examination requires certain instruments as well
some specialized equipment.

Basic equipment
- A light source—a portable headlight that runs off batteries or a head
mirror and halogen light source off the back of the examination chair
are the standard.
- Wooden tongue depressors.
- Nasal speculum.
- An otoscope with several-sized specula.
- Ear curette for cerumen removal.
- Pneumatic attachment for the otoscope.
- Tuning fork 512 Hz.
- Angled dental mirror for evaluation of the larynx and nasopharynx.

Specialized equipment
-

Anesthetic spray such as 4% lidocaine or pontocaine.
A flexible laryngopharyngoscope with light source.
Rigid nasal endoscope.
Aqueous lubricating gel for the scopes.
Suction equipment with several-size nasal and otologic suctions.
Microalligators and forceps.

Emergency equipment
-

Nasal bayonet forceps.
Vaseline strip gauze.
Large nasal tampons (Merocel).
Gelfoam.
Silver nitrate sticks.
Foley catheter with 30 cc balloon.

Basic requirements
How to master use of a head mirror
The principle of the head mirror is that a light source is reflected from
the mirror onto the patient. The mirror is concave and the light is
focused to a point approximately one arm’s length from the examiner.
Also, it has a hole through which the examiner can look, also allowing
binocular vision. Correct positioning of the examiner and the light source
is important. Ensure that the light source is placed approximately level
with the patient’s left ear. You must sit opposite the patient with the light
shining directly at your mirror. Place the mirror over the right eye, close
the left eye, and adjust the mirror so that you can look through the hole
directly at the patient’s nose. Now adjust the light and mirror until
the maximum amount of light is reflected onto the patient. When the left
eye is opened, you should have binocular vision and reflected light shining
to the patient’s nose. The focal length of the mirror is approximately
2 feet. This means that the reflected light will be brightest and sharpest
when the examiner and patient are this distance apart.

CHAPTER 2

The ENT examination

Examination of the ear
2 Know your otoscope
The otoscope should be held like a pen with the little finger extended to
touch the patient’s cheek. This positioning enables an early warning of
head turning, particularly in children. The right hand holds the otoscope
for the right ear examination and vice versa; see Fig. 2.1.

Routine examination
- Ask the patient which is their better hearing ear and start by
examining this ear.
- Check with the patient that their ear is not sore to touch.
- Examine the pinna and look for preauricular abnormalities.
- Examine for postauricular and endaural scars (see Fig. 2.2).
- Straighten the external auditory canal (EAC) by pulling the pinna up
and backwards (if you are examining a baby, pull backward only).
- Examine the EAC skin and document any changes using an otoscope.
- Systematically examine the tympanic membrane.
- Visualize the handle of the malleus and follow it up to the lateral
process. Then you will not miss the superior part of the drum.
You may need to kneel down to get the correct angle.
- Perform a pneumatic otoscopy. It will be more accurate if you have
a soft-tipped speculum that can occlude the EAC (see Fig. 2.3).
- Repeat with the pathological ear.
- Perform tuning-fork tests (see Chapter 2, p. 16).
- Perform free-field test of hearing (see Chapter 2, p. 20).
- Check facial nerve function—ask the patient to smile and close their
eyes while you look for facial weakness.
- Perform cranial nerve examination (see Chapter 2, p. 34).
- Visualize the eustachian tube orifice or torus tubarius with a dental
mirror or endoscope. This is especially important when examining an
adult with a unilateral middle ear infection.
- Perform indirect laryngoscopy (see Chapter 2, p. 26). Visualize the
larynx and hypopharynx with a dental mirror. This can be done on
most individuals who can control their gag reflex.

CHAPTER 2

The ENT examination

Using an otoendoscope
The use of this instrument is becoming more widespread in Otolaryngology.
It is often attached to a camera and TV monitor. The patient may enjoy
seeing their ear on screen, and it can help when explaining ear pathology
or surgery. No anesthetic is necessary. The end can fog up, so use an
anti-fog or alcohol wipe to demist (see Fig. 2.4).

Tuning fork tests
These are tests of hearing most often used to differentiate between a
conductive and a sensorineural hearing loss. They should be performed
with a tuning fork of 512 Hz. If the frequency is lower, vibrations are
produced that can mislead patients who think this is an auditory stimulus.
The ends of a tuning fork are known as tynes. The loudest sound from
the tuning fork is produced at the end of the tyne.
Start the tuning fork by hitting your elbow or knee. Plucking the tynes
produces less efficient sound, and hitting a table or desk edge produces
overtones. Weber’s and Rinne’s test’s are performed together to help
identify the type of hearing loss.
Weber’s test
In this test (Fig. 2.5), the tuning fork is placed at the top of the patient’s
head. The patient then says which ear hears the sound loudest, or if it is
in the middle.
In normal hearing, sound is not localized to either ear. In sensorineural
hearing loss, the non-affected ear hears the sound loudest. In conductive
loss the sound is heard loudest in the affected ear.

CHAPTER 2

The ENT examination

Rinne’s test
This test (Fig. 2.6) is used to compare air conduction with bone conduction. The activated tuning fork is placed behind the patient’s ear, against
the mastoid process. The patient is asked to say when they stop hearing
the stimulus. The tuning fork is then moved to a position 2 cm away from
the EAC and held with the tips of the tynes level and in line with the ear
canal. The patient is then asked if they can hear the sound.
This test can be modified by moving the tuning fork from the mastoid
to the EAC before the sound has diminished. The patient is then asked
which is the louder sound.
The test results can be confusing, because a pathological test result
is called a negative test! This is contrary to almost all other tests in medicine, where a positive result is an abnormal result and a negative result
is normal. Often a description of the findings is used instead.
- Positive test: air conduction is better than bone conduction
(AC > BC). This is a normal finding.
- Negative test: bone conduction is better than air conduction
(BC > AC). This is abnormal and suggests conductive hearing loss.
False negative Rinne’s test
This happens when the sound is actually being heard by the other ear.
Sound conducted by bone is absorbed and travels across the skull, so
when the tuning fork is placed on the left side it will be heard almost as
well by the right inner ear as the left. To stop this effect, the other ear
can be masked.

CHAPTER 2

The ENT examination

Free-field hearing tests
Patients will usually require a formal audiogram for most chronic otologic
conditions. However, there are some situations when you may need to
make a rough guess at a patient’s hearing threshold. This might happen
because there are no formal audiometric facilities available, or if you
suspect a patient may be exaggerating a hearing loss.
During this test, your own voice is used as a sound stimulus, while the
patient’s non-test ear is masked by rubbing your finger over the tragus.
This produces some sound, which helps to “mask” that ear. Practice is essential, as the positioning for this procedure can be awkward; see Fig. 2.7.
Procedure
- Shield the patient’s eyes with your hand.
- With your other hand, tragal rub the non-test earn to simulate
masking.
- Whisper a number at approximately 60 cm or arm’s length from the
test ear.
- If the patient cannot hear, use a normal-volume spoken voice,
followed by a shout if necessary.
- Repeat with the opposite ear.
Patients should be 50% accurate at repeating your words to pass the test.
If they hear your whisper at a distance of 60 cm, then their hearing is
better than 30 dB.
2 Examining tip
You can perform a cruder version of this test in a covert manner. When
the patient sits in front of you, a whispered question as you hold the
patient’s notes in front of your mouth can produce an interesting
response, not always corresponding to the patient’s seemingly poor
audiogram!

CHAPTER 2

The ENT examination

Examination of the nose
Basic position
The patient should be sitting in a swivel chair opposite the seated examiner.
It is useful to have the patient’s chair slightly higher than the examiner’s
chair. A good light source is essential: use either a bull light positioned over
the patient’s left shoulder reflected onto the nose via a head mirror or
a headlight. Systematically begin the exam from external to internal.

External nose
- Check for scars.
- Look at the skin type and thickness.
- Observe and palpate the nasal bones, upper lateral, and lower
lateral cartilages.
- Look for symmetry and abnormal seating of the cartilages with the
patient in the right and left lateral position and straight on.
- Tilt the head back to view the columella and alar cartilages in a similar way.

Internal nose
- Check the patency of each nasal airway.
- Occlude one nostril with a thumb and then ask the patient to sniff in
through the nose.
- Repeat on the opposite side.
- With children a dental mirror held under the nose will show exhaled
air; if there is a blockage, it will not steam up.
- Perform Cottle’s test. If there is obstruction at the nasal valve, this
test will improve airflow (see Fig. 2.8).
- Inspect the nose internally using the nasal speculum. An otoscope with
a large speculum can be used for children. The nasal speculum is held
with the dominant hand and should be inserted into the nose vertically
but then rotated so that the prongs of the speculum exert pressure
inferiorly and superiorly. Avoid placing pressure on the nasal septum,
as this area is highly sensitive and bleeds easily.
- Assess the straightness and integrity of the septum.
- Assess the size and appearance of the turbinates.
- Note the mucosal appearance and look for the presence of polyps.
- Use the endoscope to assess the posterior part of the nose.

Nasopharyngeal examination (indirect nasopharyngoscopy)
See Fig. 2.9.
- Inspect the posterior choana and nasopharynx with an endoscope or
a mirror.
- Anesthetize the oropharynx.
- Hold a tongue depressor in the right hand and use it to depress the
patient’s tongue.
- In the other hand, use a small mirror and run it along the top of the
tongue depressor to enter the oropharynx behind the soft palate.
- The reflected light should illuminate the nasopharynx to visualize the
posterior choana and the ends of the inferior turbinates. Any adenoid
tissue will also be seen.

CHAPTER 2

The ENT examination

Rigid nasal endoscopy
Procedure
Nasal endoscopy is commonly used to evaluate the nasal cavity and
nasopharynx and is especially valuable for the evaluation of nasal polyps
and abnormal anatomy. The endoscope is often used for suctioning,
debridement, and instrumentation of the nasal cavity.
- Before starting, warn the patient that the nasal spray tastes dreadful,
that their throat will be numb, and that food or drink should not
be consumed for an hour.
- Prepare the patient’s nose with lidocaine or cophenylcaine spray,
usually two sprays to each nostril. The anesthetic and vasoconstrictive
effect of the spray takes several minutes to work, so it is essential to
wait before starting the procedure.
- A standard nasal endoscope is 4 mm in diameter and angled either
0* or 30*. A 2.7 mm scope can be helpful in a narrow nose.
- Use the standard three-pass technique as shown in Fig. 2.10. Fig. 2.11
shows the differing views of the nasal anatomy on the three passes.

CHAPTER 2

The ENT examination

Examination of the mouth, larynx,
and pharynx
Examination of the oral cavity
A good light source is essential. Ask the patient to remove all dentures
to avoid missing important pathology. Ask the patient to open their
mouth wide; limitation of jaw opening (trismus) may occur as a result of
acute inflammation or tumor infiltration of the muscles of mastication.
Trismus is graded on the basis of interincisor distance. A normal interincisor
distance is greater than 3.5 cm. In an orderly way, inspect the different
components of the tongue. Pay particular attention to the lateral edges
of the tongue, especially posteriorly. It may be necessary to use the
tongue depressor to push the tongue medially to adequately examine
this area. Any abnormality seen should also be examined with a gloved
finger, since tumors of the tongue are usually hard and the depth of invasion
can be difficult to assess by inspection alone. Now turn your attention to
the floor of the mouth, the lower teeth, and gums. Use a tongue depressor
to distract the cheek and to look at the parotid duct opening (Stenson’s
duct), opposite the second upper molar tooth. Inspect both hard and soft
palate. Inspect in turn each of the tonsils, as well as the posterior pharyngeal wall. Test the movements of the palate by asking the patient to say
“aahh” and the integrity of the hypoglossal nerve by asking them to stick
out their tongue. The best way to assess the submandibular gland is via
bimanual palpation with one hand placed on the neck and a gloved finger of
the other in the floor of the mouth.

Examination of the larynx and pharynx
A lot of information can be gained by simply listening to the patient’s
voice. A weak, breathy voice with a poor cough may suggest vocal cord
palsy. A harsh, hoarse voice is suggestive of a vocal cord lesion. With
experience one can also recognize the characteristic voice of vocal cord
nodules and Reinke’s edema; however, the definitive diagnosis depends
on inspection of the vocal cords.

How to perform indirect laryngoscopy
Positioning of the patient is very important; the patient should be placed
leaning slightly forward with the head slightly extended. An appropriately
sized laryngeal mirror should be selected that is large enough to give a
good view but small enough to be placed comfortably at the back of the
mouth. Spraying the oral cavity with a topical anesthetic may help.
The mirrored surface should be gently warmed using warm beads, hot
water, or an electrical mirror warmer. Have the patient go into a sniffing
position with their back straight and slightly inclined towards you.
The chin should be extended slightly forward, Position the light directly into
the oropharynx. Have the patient open their mouth and pull the tongue
forward with a gauze pad. Insert the dental mirror through the mouth with
it angled inferiorly, trying to avoid the base of tongue and the lateral

tonsillar pillars. Lift the soft palate posteriorly, and the hypopharynx and
larynx should come into view (see Fig. 2.12). Ask the patient to concentrate
on their breathing; sometimes asking them to pant helps them to focus
further and also improves your view. Ask the patient to say “eeee” and
note the movements of the vocal cords.

CHAPTER 2

The ENT examination

Flexible laryngoscopy
Flexible direct laryngoscopy is a very important component of examining
the upper aerodigestive tract. This is easy to perform in the outpatient
clinic, usually with the aid of some topical decongestant and anesthetic.
Unlike rigid telescopes, which have sets of lens arranged longitudinally,
the flexible laryngoscope (sometimes also referred to as a nasopharyngoscope) is traditionally a fiber-optic device. The newer, flexible endoscopes have a digital camera chip embedded in the distal tip, and offer
greater image quality than that of fiber-optic laryngoscopes.

Technique
The flexible scope is passed through the nose, giving the opportunity to
inspect the middle and inferior turbinates, nasal septum, and osteomeatal
complex. The presence of mucopus, nasal septal deviation, vascular
ectasias. and abnormal nasal anatomy should be noted. The endoscope is
then advanced to the nasopharynx where the eustachian tube orifices,
fossa of Rosenmuller, and adenoids can be seen. The function of the
velopharyngeal complex can be seen by asking the patient to say “kaa kaa
kaa.” This will raise the palate to form a complete seal around the nasopharynx. The presence of secretions or bubbles in the nasopharynx with
this maneuver suggests velopharyngeal insufficiency. By advancing past
the superior aspect of the soft palate the endoscopist can see the tongue
base, lingual tonsils, vallecula, laryngeal inlet, and pyriform fossa. Visualization of these areas can be improved by asking the patient to stick out
their tongue and also performing a Valsalva maneuver while the examiner
pinches the patient’s nose to prevent air escape. Special care should be
made to evaluate the pyriform fossa, which is an area difficult to assess
and can hide a malignancy.
Movements of the vocal cords can be assessed by asking the patient to
speak. Connected speech function and vocal fold movement are evaluated and the presence of hyperfunction checked (does the false vocal
fold overshadow the true vocal folds during speech?). Evidence of tremor
or dystonia should also be noted. Any mucosal abnormalities should be
carefully examined and documented. The patient should be asked to
cough and clear their throat and to swallow, to assess these vegetative
tasks.
Special tests such as functional endoscopic evaluation of swallowing
(FEES) and the Muller maneuver for obstructive sleep apnea can also be
performed with the flexible laryngoscope.

CHAPTER 2

The ENT examination

Stroboscopy
Fine movements of the vocal cords and mucosal wave require stroboscopic examination. A microphone is placed on the neck and the frequency of vocal cord vibration is matched to the frequency of a strobe
light flashing. The resulting image shown is a slow-motion, moving image
of the vocal cords. The mucosal wave is the undulation of the superficial
layers of the vocal cord, which produces sound and pitch through vibration.
The vocal cords are folds of tissue composed of the muscle, ligament, soft
tissue, and epithelium. The vocal cords are the principal sound generator
for phonation. The image is captured from a 60* or 70* rigid telescope
inserted into the mouth. Flexible distal-chip digital endoscopes are capable
of rendering detailed images of the mucosal wave and can also be used
for stroboscopic evaluation.

Technique
Insertion of the rigid telescope is poorly tolerated in patients with a
hypersensitive gag reflex, and the technique requires practice to master.
The patient sits upright and leans slightly forward with the chin extended
in a “sniffing” position. The tongue is extended and gently grasped and
retracted forward. The telescope is inserted into the oral cavity carefully;
the anterior tonsillar pillars and base of tongue should be avoided.
The angulation of the telescope is designed so that the glottis is visualized
as the tip of the scope is in the oropharynx. The patient is asked to sustain
a long |a|, at several different pitches and the mucosal wave is evaluated.
Vocal fold nodules, scar, sulcus, varices, hemorrhages, and polyps are often
evaluated with stroboscopy. See Fig. 2.13 for an image of the vocal folds
seen with a rigid endoscope.

CHAPTER 2

The ENT examination

Examination of the neck
Start by inspecting the neck from the front. Look for any scars, masses,
deformity, or asymmetry that may be visible. Ask the patient to swallow
and pay particular attention to the lower central neck, looking for a
thyroid mass, which should rise on swallowing. Again, a systematic
examination will ensure that no area is missed. See Fig. 2.14, which
illustrates a suggested method of examination.

Examination of a neck mass
If you do find a mass or abnormality, ensure that you can adequately
describe it and how it is related to the anatomy of the neck—i.e., site,
size, consistency, surface, mobility; is it single or pulsatile? The position of
a neck mass will give clues as to the likely cause. Fig. 2.15 gives a list of
the common differential diagnoses, depending on the site of the mass.

Examination of the thyroid
Thyroid masses are common and often appear in exams. Because of the
systemic nature of thyroid disorders, some additional points are important to demonstrate. An overview of the patient’s appearance should be
made. Note a cold or hot and sweaty hand, which may indicate hypo- or
hyperthyroidism, respectively; similarly, look at the skin and hair quality.
Look for loss of the outer third of the eyebrow, which may occur in
hypothyroid function. Look at the neck from the front and ask the patient
to swallow, noting any thyroid masses that will rise during swallowing.
Ask the patient to cough, listening for a weak cough and breathy voice,
which may occur in a recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy due to malignant
infiltration of the nerve. Now move behind the patient and feel the midline
from the chin to the sternal notch. Feel for any midline lumps, especially
thyroglossal cysts, which will elevate on protrusion of the tongue, distinguishing them from the thyroid isthmus. Remember that the normal
thyroid gland is soft and difficult to distinguish from surrounding soft
tissue. Feel each of the lobes in turn as well as the isthmus, asking the
patient to swallow once more and checking if any palpable mass rises
during swallowing.

Examination of salivary glands
Palpation of the parotid gland should be included in the routine examination
of the neck. Remember that most parotid masses are found just behind
the angle of the mandible and that the tail of the parotid gland can extend
down into the neck as far as the hyoid. Tumors of the deep lobe of the
parotid may present as a mass arising in the mouth and pushing the tonsil
medially. Examination of the parotid gland includes testing the function of
the facial nerve and visualization and palpation of the duct.
Submandibular gland masses are best felt via bimanual palpation.
Remember to also inspect and palpate the length of the submandibular
duct as it runs along the floor of the mouth and opens at a punctum next
to the frenulum of the tongue.

CHAPTER 2

The ENT examination

Cranial nerve examination
Examination of the cranial nerves (CN) is a routine part of the head and
neck examination. Thorough knowledge of the route and nature of each
cranial nerve is one of the basic skills of the otolaryngologist and a major
tool in the clinical armamentarium.

Cranial nerve I—olfactory nerve
Olfaction is tested by asking the patient to smell and describe a scent.
Commonly used are cloves or spices kept in an air-tight container. Wipes
with a lemon scent can also be used. Smelling salts and alcohol should
not be used, as the chemicals’ irritants stimulate the trigeminal nerve.
There are also commercially available smelling tests such as the University
of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test.
The sensory fibers are present within the olfactory groove just below
the cribriform plate. Problems with smell can be the result of nasal
obstruction or disorders of the neurosensory cells within the groove or
the frontal lobe.

Cranial nerve II—optic nerve
The second cranial nerve is tested with a Snellen chart and visual-field
testing. The patient is asked to hold the chart at arm’s length (generally
20 cm) and to recite each letter. The eyes are tested singly. The visual
field is tested by having the patient fixate on the examiner’s nose and then
introducing the examiner’s fingers into the peripheral vision. By keeping
the hands an equal distance apart, the examiner can compare the patient’s
visual field with his or her own.

Cranial nerve III—oculomotor nerve
The oculomotor nerve innervates most of the extraocular muscles—the
superior rectus, medial rectus, inferior rectus, and inferior oblique as well
as the levator palpebrae superioris. The examination is composed of
having the patient track the finger of the examiner into all four quadrants
of the visual field.
CNIII also has a parasympathetic function, which arises from the
Edinger–Westphal nucleus. The fibers carry signal to the ciliary muscles
and sphincter pupillae muscles, which regulate papillary dilation.

Cranial nerve IV—trochlear nerve
The trochlear nerve innervates the superior oblique muscle. Isolated
dysfunction of CNIV can be subtle. The paralysis results in outward rotation
of the eye and weakness of downward gaze. Patients commonly complain
of difficulty going down stairs.

Cranial nerve V—trigeminal nerve
The trigeminal nerve has motor and sensory functions and is traditionally
divided into three major divisions. The trigeminal ganglion sits in Meckel’s
cave, which is in the floor of the middle cranial fossa. Testing is performed
with a cotton-tipped applicator.

CRANIAL NERVE EXAMINATION 1

- V3: The mandibular division of the trigeminal nerve, or V3, provides
sensation into the lower face as well as the mouth. The sensory nerves
include the buccal, auriculotemporal, lingual, inferior alveolar, and
meningeal branches. The mandibular branch also has motor function,
providing innervation to the muscles of mastication—the tensor
tympani, tensor veli palatini, mylohyoid, and anterior belly of the
digastric muscles.
- V2: The maxillary division of the trigeminal nerve, or V2, provides
sensation to the mid-face. The sensory branches are carried by the
zygomatic, infraorbital, ptyerygopalatine, and meningeal nerves.
- V1: The ophthalmic division is primarily sensory. The signal is
carried by the lacimal, frontal, nasopharyngeal, and meningeal nerves.
Parasympathetic fibers originating from the facial nerve, CNVII, join
the lacrimal nerve.
The corneal reflex tests the reflex arc between CNV and CNVII and may
be a subtle finding associated with cerebellopontine angle (CPA) lesions.
Use a cotton ball to stimulate the lateral conjunctiva to reflexively close
the eye.

Cranial nerve VI—abducens nerve
The abducens nerve innervates the lateral rectus muscle. Dysfunction of
CNVI results in difficulty rotating the globe medially, leading to double
vision, or diplopia.

Cranial nerve VII—facial nerve
Anatomy
The facial nerve has motor, sensory, including special sensory of taste,
and parasympathetic functions. The convergence and divergence of the
various fibers from one nerve to branches of other cranial nerves can
produce significant confusion. It is important to study the path and function
of this nerve carefully.
The facial-nerve anatomy is often classified by its position in relationship
to the temporal bone; it is divided into an intracranial component,
intratemporal segment (which is further divided into a meatal, labyrinthine,
tympanic [horizontal], and mastoid [vertical] component), and extratemporal
segments.
The nervus intermedius provides the parasympathiec and sensory fibers
of the facial nerve. The motor nucleus joins the nervus intermediasis
within the CPA to form the common facial nerve.
The nerve enters the internal auditory meatus and enters the temporal
bone. The nerve makes its first turn, or first genu, at the geniculate ganglion,
which houses sensory neurons. The greater superficial petrosal nerve is the
first branch off the facial nerve and carries preganglionic parasympathetic
fibers to the lacrimal gland.
After the first genu, the tympanic segment of the nerve enters the
middle ear and courses between the oval window and stapes. The bony
covering in the tympanic segment may be dehiscent, and this is an area of
vulnerability for the nerve during ear infections and otologic surgery.

35

36

CHAPTER 2

The ENT examination

The nerve then makes a second turn, or second genu, and enters a
vertical pathway down the mastoid portion of the temporal bone.
The stapedial nerve, which innervates the stapedius muscle as well as the
chorda tympani, which carries parasympathetic fibers and special sensory
of taste fibers (provides taste to the anterior two thirds of the tongue) to
the lingual nerve (of CNV), branches off at this region.
The nerve then leaves the temporal bone via the stylomastoid foramen.
The facial nerve provides innervation to the muscles of facial expression,
the stylohyoid nerve, the nerve to the posterior digastric, and postauricular
nerve. The innervation to the facial muscles is carried out via the five
divisions of the main motor trunk, called the Pes anserinus: the temporal,
zygomatic, buccal, mandibular, and cervical branches.

Cranial nerve VII—facial nerve
Functional testing
The facial nerve has motor and sensory function, provides special sensory
of taste, and has parasympathetic function.
Motor function is tested by asking the patient to smile, grimace, wrinkle
the nose, close the eye, and raise the eyebrows. The House–Brackman
scale (Table 2.1) is used to describe the severity of paralysis. Also look
for tics, spasms, and synkinesis.
Dysfunction at the brainstem or central nervous system (CNS) level
can be differentiated from peripheral nerve dysfunction by the movement
at the forehead. Centrally, there is bilateral innervation of the motor
nerve nucleus; therefore, CNS disorders producing facial paralysis will
have intact forehead movement. Peripheral disorders will result in paralysis
of the forehead as well.
Lacrimal function and tear production can be assessed with Shirmer’s test,
which involves placing a filter paper strip at the corner of the lateral
canthus.
The sensory component of the facial nerve can be assessed by sensory
testing of the concha of the external ear, the postauricular skin, and wall
of the external auditory canal (Hitselberger sign).
Taste is often difficult to test because of bilateral innervation of the
chorda tympani, the sensory component provided by CNV and CNIX,
and the substantial role of smell in taste cues. Patients with chorda tympani dysfunction often complain of a metallic taste or alterations in taste.
Patients may also complain of hypersensitivity to loud noises or
hyperacusis, because the stapedius muscle has a role in dampening
sounds. The stapedial reflex may be tested on the audiogram; however, a
significant percentage of the normal population lack the stapedial reflex
on testing.
Facial nerve dysfunction with diplopia suggests an injury at the brainstem
as the facial nerve motor fibers loop around the abducens motor nucleus.
Ancillary testing such as electromyography (EMG) or electroneuronography (ENoG) may be useful in the setting of facial nerve paralysis.

Cranial nerve VIII—vestibulocochlear nerve
The vestibulococlear nerve is a special sensory nerve that carries auditory
and vestibular information from the cochlea, utricle, saccule, and semicircular
canals.
The hearing test may be performed with tuning forks, free-field testing,
and formal audiometry. The vestibular function may be assessed by testing
the extraocular nerves for nystagmus, gait and balance testing, Romberg
testing and Unterberger stepping test, and finger-to-nose testing.
Romberg test Have the patient stand straight with eyes closed and feet
parallel and slightly less than shoulder length apart. Stand at the side and
be prepared to stabilize the patient in case of fall. Normally, this position
should be maintained for greater than 30 seconds without significant
body sway.
Unterberger stepping test Have the patient march in step with eyes
closed. Unilateral vestibular dysfunction will often result in the patient
rotating toward the side of the lesion.
Nystagmus refers to rhythmic eye movements that occur with visual
tracking. Have the patient track your finger horizontally and then vertically across the visual field. Carefully observe the pupils at rest. There is a
fast twitch or jerk of the eyes followed by a slow correction. Nystagmus
may by physiologic, induced (such as during caloric testing or Dix–Hallpike
maneuvers), or pathologic. Pathological or spontaneous nystagmus is present at rest within 30* of the central visual field. Physiologic nystagmus is
present at the lateral gazes. The direction of the nystagmus, by convention,
is described by the direction of the fast phase.

37

CHAPTER 2

The ENT examination

Cranial nerve IX—glossopharyngeal nerve
The glossopharyngeal nerve provides special taste sensation and general
sensation to the posterior one-third of the tongue, motor function to the
stylopharyngeus muscle, parasympathetic stimulation to the parotid gland
via Jacobson’s nerve, visceral sensory signal from the carotid body and
sinus, and sensory signal from the external auditory canal and medial
surface of the tympanic membrane.
The motor function of CNIX is tested by watching the symmetry and
movement of the soft palate. Unilateral weakness is usually seen as deviation of the uvula away from the affected side.
The sensory function of CNIX is tested by stimulating the back of the
tongue and soft palate. A decreased gag reflex suggests dysfunction.
Throat pain and ear pain often occur together because of the common
nerve fibers.
CNIX often has dysfunction with other cranial nerves that exit the
skull from the jugular foramen. The associated cranial neuropathies are
referred to as jugular foramen syndrome and involve dysfunction on CNIX,
X, XI, and XII.

Cranial nerve X—vagus nerve
The vagus nerve has motor, somatic sensory, and visceral sensory functions.
CNX is widely dispersed throughout the body and has major regulatory
functions outside the head and neck involving the respiratory, gastrointestinal, and cardiovascular systems.
The motor function involves innervation of the muscles of the pharynx
and larynx. It also provides visceral function and innervation to the
smooth muscles and glands of the pharynx, larynx, thorax, and abdomen.
The head and neck sensory component of the vagus is carried from the
external ear canal and lateral tympanic membrane (via Arnold’s nerve) as
well as the pharynx and larynx.
Like CNIX, the motor function of CNX is tested by watching the
symmetry and movement of the soft palate. Unilateral weakness is
usually seen as deviation of the uvula away from the affected side.
The recurrent laryngeal nerve and superior laryngeal nerve are branches
from the vagus that innervate the larynx. Evaluation of vocal fold movement
for evidence of paralysis is performed with indirect or direct laryngoscopy. The flexible laryngoscope can also be used to gently touch the
arytenoids and aryepiglottic (AE) folds to evaluate the sensory function
of the vagus via the superior laryngeal nerve.

Cranial nerve XI—spinal accessory nerve
The spinal accessory nerve is a pure motor nerve that provides innervation
to the sternocleidomastoid and the trapezius muscles. Weakness of
these muscles is tested by firmly clasping the shoulder and asking the
patient to shrug against resistance.
Dysfunction of CNXI is most commonly seen after neck surgery and it
is often removed during cancer resection.

CRANIAL NERVE EXAMINATION 1

Cranial nerve XII—hypoglossal nerve
The hypoglossal nerve is another pure motor nerve that innervates the
tongue. The nerve is tested by asking the patient to protrude the tongue
fully and moving it from side to side and vertically. A unilateral lesion of
the hypoglossal nerve results in the tongue protruding toward the side of
dysfunction.

The timing of the onset of discharge in relation to any pain often helps with diagnosis. Otitis externa in particular can be secondary
to infection spreading from the middle ear. Microsuction, or dry mopping, is often necessary to visualize the tympanic membrane.
A final diagnosis is sometimes not possible until the ear has been cleaned and the local infection has been treated. It is important
to visualize the ear drum after treatment in order to exclude serious pathology at the level of the tympanic membrane.

Common methods of presentation

Patients who present with otalgia can present a challenging problem. A careful history can help distinguish many conditions. Watch for
the red reflex—a reflex dilatation of the blood vessels on the handle of the malleus caused by the otoscope speculum touching the
bony ear canal. Also, a crying child will often have flushed, erythematous tympanic membranes (TM). This is often misdiagnosed as
early acute otitis media, and the true cause of otalgia is missed. Always consider if the otalgia is referred pain.

CHAPTER 4

Investigations in ENT

Hearing physiology
Hearing is the product of a special sensory pathway that involves the
detection of sound energy through air vibration that gets transformed
into neuroelectrical signals for interpretation by the brain. The physiology
and anatomy of hearing is reviewed in detail in Chapters 12 to 14.
The sound energy is propagated through the air and collected in the
external ear. The external ear is designed to collected and funnel sound
towards the eardrum or tympanic membrane. The tympanic membrane
then collects the air vibrations and transforms them into mechanical
vibration towards the inner ear via the middle ear bones, or ossicles.
The ossicular chain is composed of three bones, the malleus, incus, and
stapes. The stapes articulates with the inner ear cochlea via the stapes
footplate and distributes the vibration into the fluid-filled spaces of the
cochlea. Inner hair cells of the cochlea depolarize in response to the fluid
wave and send the sound signal into the brainstem via the auditory nerve,
a component of cranial nerve 8. This signal goes to the dorsal cochlear
nucleus, which then distributes the neural signal to the temporal lobe via
the thalamus.
At each step of the process of translating and transforming the
air-conducted vibratory sound energy into neural signal, there are special
adaptations of the hearing apparatus. The pinna and the external auditory
canal have a natural resonance of approximately 2000 Hz and are
responsible for a gain of approximately 20 dB. The size of the tympanic
membrane in comparison to the stapes footplate is approximately 15 to 1,
resulting in a 15-fold amplification. The lever action of the middle ear
ossicles further amplifies the vibration 1.3-fold. The net amplification is
20-fold, which results in a gain of approximately 20 to 35 dB.
The audiogram is composed of several parts designed to test the various
components of hearing. Air tone audiometry is used to test the entire
pathway from the external ear to the brain, while bone conduction tests
the pathway from the inner ear function onward. Otoacoustic emissions
testing is used to look specifically at cochlear function, and auditory
brainstem testing evaluates the auditory nerve pathway towards the
brain. Tympanometry tests the tympanic membrane resistance. By using
these tests and understanding the physiology of the auditory system,
otolaryngologists can diagnose the location of ear problems.

Definitions
Bell (B) Unit of sound intensity and pressure.
Decibel (dB) 10 Bell. A decibel is a relative measure. Zero dB is set as the
lowest intensity of sound an average normal ear can detect. A decibel is a
nonlinear measurement. The difference between 1 and 2 dB is 10-fold.

CHAPTER 4

Investigations in ENT

Pure tone audiometry (PTA)
This is the most common method used for assessing hearing. Ideally, the
examination takes place in a soundproof booth. The ears should be clear
of any obstructing cerumen.
The examiner and the patient are in contact via a microphone and a
headset. The patient wears headphones and is given a handheld button to
press when he or she hears a sound during the test. The better hearing
ear is tested first.
The test begins with air-conducted sounds. Initially, sound is played
through the headphones at a level above the hearing threshold. The sound
is decreased in 10 dB increments until it is no longer heard. The sound
intensity is then increased in 5 dB increments until a 50% response rate is
obtained.
- The frequency order of testing is 1 kHz, 2 kHz, 4 kHz, 8 kHz, 500 Hz,
250 Hz, and then repeated at 1 kHz.
- The re-test at 1 kHz should be within 10 dB of the initial result.
- The test–retest error is approximately 5 dB.
The test is then repeated using bone conduction. The bone conductor is
tightly applied to the mastoid area where the skin is tethered to the bone
more securely and better contact is obtained. Sound is transmitted to the
cochlea as direct vibration of the temporal bone. Because the vibrations
are easily transmitted to the opposite temporal bone, masking is frequently required. The bone conduction studies are compared with the air
conduction studies to obtain the air bone gap. Whereas air conduction
studies test the entire auditory tract, the bone conduction studies bypass
the external and middle ear components and directly test the cochlear
function and downstream components.

Interpretation of pure tone audiometry
-

Normal hearing is detection of pure tones at less than 20 dB.
Mild hearing loss: 21–40 dB
Moderate hearing loss: 41–60 dB
Severe hearing loss: 61–80 dB
Profound hearing loss: no detection of pure tones below 81 dB

Masking
Like tuning-fork testing, there is a potential source of error in the
pure tone audiogram. This is because sound can be perceived in the nontest ear if it is conducted through bone or through the air. The main
differences are the following:
- 10 dB for bone conduction
- 40 dB for air conduction
When thresholds show a difference of >10 dB or >40 dB, then masking
should be used. This is the amount of sound intensity detectable to the
opposite ear when a sound is presented to one ear.

PURE TONE AUDIOMETRY (PTA) 1

Masking is the application of white noise to the non-test ear to prevent
it from picking up sounds presented to the test ear. Masking is required
when
- Air conduction audiometry shows a >40 dB difference in the two ears.
- The difference in air conduction threshold between the test ear and
the bone conduction in the non-test ear is >40 dB.
- An unmasked air bone gap in the test ear is >10 dB (a sensorineural
loss may be hidden).

CHAPTER 4

Investigations in ENT

Speech audiometry
Speech reception is an important component of the audiogram and
evaluates the ability to interpret sound energy and process it into recognizable patterns. In speech audiometry, spoken words, generally balanced
monosyllabic words (phonemes) or two-syllable words (spondees), are
used.

Definitions
Pure tone average (PTA) The average thresholds for the most important
speech frequencies, 500, 1000, and 2000 HZ.
Speech reception threshold (SRT) The lowest decibel of hearing that a
patient can repeat a spondee 50% of the time. The SRT should be within
10 dB of the PTA.
Speech Discrimination Score (SDS) The percentage (%) of phonemes
that the patient can repeat correctly at 20 to 40 dB above the SRT.
Rollover A phenomenon that reflects the ability of a retrocochlear process
to cause greater problems with discrimination. Patients have a poor SRT
and SDS disproportionate to their PTA.

Tympanometry
Tympanometry is a way of measuring the pressure in the middle ear.
It was developed and popularized by Jerger1 as a way of establishing the
cause of conductive deafness. He classified the different patterns described
later (see Fig. 4.1).

A probe is placed in the external auditory meatus to give a tight seal to
the external ear canal (EAC). This probe can vary the pressure in the
EAC while firing a 225 Hz sound signal at the tympanic membrane (TM),
or eardrum. The probe then measures the amount of sound reflected
from the TM and calculates how much of the sound energy is admitted.
Most sound is admitted when the pressure in the EAC matches that of
the middle ear space. Thus, the instrument measures the compliance
of the TM. By calculating the amount of air needed to change the EAC
pressure, the machine also calculates an approximate EAC volume.

Normal ear
Type A Normal tympanogram. The peak is at atmospheric pressure and
reflects maximal compliance.

Ossicular chain problems
Type As (A shallow) The normal tympanogram can be flattened as a
fixed ossicular chain reduces compliance. This can be the result of
otosclerosis or middle ear effusion.
Type Ad (A deep) The disarticulated ossicular chain causes the compliance to increase. This can also occur with a thinned-out or monomeric
tympanic membrane.

Middle ear effusion or glue ear
Type B When there is fluid in the middle ear, the ear drum’s compliance
alters, giving a flat trace.

Perforation
Type B If there is a perforation in the tympanic membrane, the compliance will remain unchanged. But EAC volume will be increased as the
tympanometer measures the pressure of the EAC and middle ear space.

Eustachian tube dysfunction
Type C The peak of the tympanogram is shifted to the left side. This
type is often associated with eustachian tube dysfunction.

CHAPTER 4

Investigations in ENT

Objective hearing assessment
Otoacoustic emissions (OAE) test screening
The otoacoustic emissions test is widely used for neonatal screening of
hearing loss. This test measures the function of the cochlea. This phenomenon measures the active sounds produced by the outer hair cells
which are recorded in response to tone clicks applied to the ear.
The sound is picked up by a tiny microphone embedded into the earpiece.
The test is objective, sensitive, rapid, and easy to perform. The transientevoked otoacoustic emissions test measures the hair cell emissions after
stimulation with an auditory click, and is most commonly used test for
screening. The major drawback of this test is that many entities can result
in false positive testing, such as ear wax and fluid in the ear.

Auditory brainstem response
The auditory brainstem response (ABR) is another objective test for
hearing that evaluates the function of the auditory nerve pathway. It can
be performed on adults or children and does not require active patient
cooperation. The test measures the electrical signal from the auditory
nerve to the brain with various waveforms. Very similar to an electroencephalogram, the signal electrodes are positioned to measure the components of the pathway. The signals are measured after an acoustic
stimulus, usually a “click,” and filtered to record specific ABR waves.
The mneumonic E.COLI is frequently used to help remember the components of the auditory nerve pathway: the Eighth cranial nerve, Cochlear
nucleus, superior Olivary nuclei, lateral Lemniscus, and Inferior colliculus.
The ABR is generally used to evaluate for a retrocochlear process, or
pathology that occurs downstream of the auditory process from the
cochlea. Various common uses of ABR include the following:
- Asymmetric or unilateral auditory process such as hearing loss,
vestibular weakness, or tinnitus
- Screening for an acoustic neuroma
- Children who failed auditory screening
- Suspected malingerers
- Coma
- Intraoperative monitoring

PEDIATRIC HEARING ASSESSMENT 1

Pediatric hearing assessment
Congenital hearing loss affects approximately 1 in every 1000 newborns.
Screening based on risk factors alone may miss up to 42% of hearingimpaired infants. Universal screening is endorsed by the American Academy
of Pediatrics, the National Institutes of Health, and the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention.
Risk factors for hearing loss include the presence of craniofacial
abnormalities, a positive family history of childhood hearing loss, neonatal
intensive care unit admission for longer than 2 days, fetal infections such
as cytomegalovirus (CMV), rubella, or herpes, and presence of other
syndromes associated with hearing loss such as Usher’s or Wallenburg’s
syndrome. All neonates with these risk factors should be tested.
Assessment of the hearing of infants and children can be difficult
because most hearing tests involve the active cooperation of the participant. To avoid this problem, a number of tests have been specifically
designed for children and different tests are used at different ages.
Objective testing such as otoacoustic emissions and auditory brainstem
testing are very useful in the early stages. OAE testing is the most common
screening program for neonates.

Distraction testing
Two testers are required for this examination. The child sits on the parent
or caregiver’s lap, and one of the examiners sits in front of the child to
occupy the child’s attention. The other tester stands behind the child and
uses sounds of particular frequency and volume to stimulate the child to
turn the head. Turning is considered a positive response.

Visual reinforcement audiometry
This test is similar to distraction testing, but it uses speakers or headphones to deliver the unilateral sound. If the child turns around correctly,
then a light or a toy turns on to reward their turning.

Conditioned response audiometry
The child is conditioned to perform a task in response to a sound—for
example, putting a toy man into a toy boat.

McCormick toy testing
This test uses 12 paired toys or objects with similar-sounding names, for
example, a cup and a duck. The child points to or picks up the correct toy.
The intensity of the sound of the command can be changed. The child’s
hearing threshold is determined by an 80% response.

Pure tone audiogram
This can sometimes be performed on children as young as 3 years of age.
Use of PTA with bone conduction can be uncomfortable for younger
children.

Tympanometry
This test measures pressure in the middle ear and is useful and accurate
in detecting middle-ear effusions in children.

CHAPTER 4

Investigations in ENT

Electronystagmography (ENG)
Electronystagmography (ENG) is a balance test that measures the chorioretinal electrical potential difference. Electrodes placed near the eyes
can pick up electrical changes caused by eye movements. ENG allows
testing of the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR). The VOR enables clear vision
during head movements by producing compensatory eye movements.
The ENG test is usually done in a dimly lit room with a light bar to
provide visual calibration. The patient sits on an examination couch.

Uses of ENG
ENG enables an assessment of the following:
- Disorders in semicircular canal (SCC) and otolith organs
- Integrity of brainstem–cerebellar pathways
- Integrity of central vestibulo-ocular pathways

Subtests
If patients need more detailed investigations, they may be sent for more
tests, which may include:
- Oculomotor control test
- Saccades
- Tracking/smooth pursuit
- Optokinetic test
- Gaze test
- Positional testing
- Headshake
- Dix–Hallpike test
- Caloric tests
- Warm and cold irrigations
- Ice calorics
- Fixation tests

CALORICS 1

Calorics
This balance test involves irrigating warm or cold water into the ear.
This stimulates the inner-ear balance mechanisms and will make the
patient dizzy. The degree of stimulation can be measured by observing
the nystagmus produced. This test is performed on both ears, and any
difference gives an indication of pathology in the balance system. It is
used to confirm an inner-ear cause of a balance problem.

Procedure
- Irrigation with warm water at 44°C and cool at 30°C the EAC for
30 seconds with 200 ml of fluid
- Alternatively warm air at 50°C and cool at 24°C for 60 seconds at
9 L/min flow rate
- Temperature difference stimulates convection currents in the lateral
SCC. Nystagmus is induced according to the mneumonic COWS
(Cold Opposite, Warm the Same). Cold induces an opposite-sided
nystagmus, while warmth induces nystagmus toward the same side.
Remember, nystagmus is named by the fast component.
- Responses are compared according to formula below.

CHAPTER 4

Investigations in ENT

CT scan
Computed tomography (CT) provides excellent information for defining
differences between bone and soft tissue. Non-contrast CT scans allow
very precise imaging of bony structures within the head and neck as well
as air spaces. Non-contrast CT is commonly used to look for problems
affecting the temporal bone and the inner ear, the paranasal sinuses, facial
bones, and the upper airway. The addition of intravenous contrast enables
the evaluation of soft-tissue structures in the neck, which is important for
detecting head and neck tumors and cancers as well as infection.
CT angiograms show precise delineation of vascular structures and can
be used for the evaluation of uncontrollable bleeding, vascular tumors
and anomalies, aortic dissections, and thrombosis.

Procedure
The patient lies supine on the scanner bed. The scan uses X-rays applied
in a circumferential manner to acquire cross-sectional information, which
is processed and formatted to produce images. These can be manipulated to form images in multiple planes or to produce three-dimensional
reconstructions.
Specific imaging protocols that detail the slice thickness, plane and angle
of imaging (gantry), administration of contrast, and area scanned need to
be specified. Generally, the specific details are ordered by the radiologist
according to the diagnosis being evaluated. Therefore, a protocol for the
evaluation of sinus disease is different from that needed for the evaluation
of temporal bone fractures.

Common uses
- Paranasal sinus scan is used to evaluate chronic and acute sinusitis and
for detailing the bony anatomy for endoscopic sinus surgery.
- Evaluation of head and neck masses.
- Evaluation of the deep extension of mucosal disease as well as lymphadenopathy.
- Assessment of middle ear and mastoid infections.
- Assessment of temporal bone and skull base for infections and tumors.
- Evaluation of traumatic head, neck, and facial injuries and temporal
bone fracture.

MRI SCAN 1

MRI scan
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides excellent soft-tissue definition
without the risk of radiation. In Otolaryngology it is used for looking at
soft-tissue structures such as the nerves of the inner ear and for differentiating neoplastic disease from normal structures. In magnetic angiography
(MRA) special computer filters are used to extract images of blood flow,
and thus MRA can be used for the evaluation of vascular structures.
Evaluation of bony anatomy as well as air-bone interface is more difficult
with MRI than with CT scanning.

Procedure
The patient is placed lying down, inside a circular magnet. The magnetic
field aligns all the hydrogen atoms, mainly body water. An electromagnetic
pulse is directed toward the patient, which knocks the hydrogen atoms
out of alignment. Once the pulse wave has subsided, the hydrogen atoms
spring back into alignment. This process causes energy to be released,
which is detected by the scanner.
The timing of recording and the information collected can be analyzed
separately to give different information. Software algorithms can be used
to produce three-dimensional (3D) image information. Contrast with
gadolinium can enhance the information. Gadolinium is a paramagnetic
metal ion used as a contrast agent to provide additional information
about the vascularity of a structure.
Contraindications to MRI include ferromagnetic implants such as intracranial aneurysm clips, cardiac pacemakers, some cochlear implants, and
middle-ear prosthetics.

Common protocols
- T1-weighted scans (fat bright)
- T2-weighted scans (water bright)
- STIR sequence (short tau inversion recovery) produces fat-suppressed
images.
- MRA information from scan sequence

Uses
- Identifying an acoustic neuroma—MRI is the gold standard
- Checking the spread of a tumor
- Assessing the involvement of vascular structures in head and neck
malignancy
- Assessing the intracranial spread for sinonasal and skull base tumors

CHAPTER 4

Investigations in ENT

PET scan
In positron emission tomography (PET) a radioactive marker is used that
measures the amount of glucose consumed in a specific structure.
Although its utility is expanding, PET scanning is most commonly used for
the evaluation of neoplastic disease. 18-F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) is
concentrated in structures with a high glycolytic rate, such as tumors and
infections. PET scans are very sensitive for picking up inflammation and
are not specific for tumors.

Common uses
- Evaluation of an unknown primary tumor in patients with metastatic
neck cancer
- Assessment of residual or recurrent disease following therapy or in a
postsurgical bed
- Search for synchronous or metachronous primary lesions
- Search for metastatic disease, especially distant metastases

SKIN PRICK TESTING 1

Skin prick testing
This test enables you to detect if a patient is allergic to various
substances. It has a rapid result, allowing you to see the allergic response.
Skin prick testing is used in patients with allergic rhinitis, to guide therapy
and to give advice on which allergens to avoid. The test relies on histamine release by sensitized mast cells. Antihistamines, steroids, and certain
other medications (calcium channel blockers and tricyclic antidepressants)
may decrease the sensitivity of the test.
Intradermal testing is similar in technique and use to skin prick testing,
except the injection is placed deeper and at higher concentrations.
This results in greater sensitivity at higher risk for anaphylaxis.

Procedure
- Because of the risk for anaphylaxis during skin prick testing, it is important to ensure that resuscitation facilities are nearby.
- The procedure for testing should be explained to the patient. The test
solutions are then placed on the patient’s forearm. These include a
positive control substance (histamine) and a negative control substance
(carrier solution). A small amount of solution is inoculated by using a
lancet pricked into the patient’s skin.
- A positive response is measured after 15–30 minutes, as a wheal
>4 mm. (It should be at least 2 mm greater than the negative control.)

CHAPTER 5

The mouth, tonsils, and adenoids

Anatomy
The oral cavity extends from the lips to the anterior pillar of the tonsil
(see Fig. 5.1). The superior extent is marked at the hard palate and soft
palate junction while the inferior boundary is marked by the circumvallate
papilla of the tongue. Subsites include the lips, the inferior and superior
alveolar ridges, anterior tongue, floor of mouth, retromolar trigone, hard
palate, and buccal mucosa.
The oropharynx extends from the anterior tonsillar pillar to the posterior pharyngeal wall. The superior junction is at the interface of the hard
and soft palate while the inferior junction is marked at the circumvallate
papilla. The oropharynx contains the tonsils, soft palate, lateral pharyngeal
walls, and the base of the tongue.
The nasopharynx is located above the hard palate and contains the
adenoids. The torus tubarius encloses the eustachian tubes orifices laterally. The superior lateral extent is marked by the fossa of Rosenmuller
and the base of the sphenoid. The nasopharynx communicates with the
nasal cavity anteriorly. The soft palate forms the inferior boundary.

The tongue
The anterior two-thirds and posterior third of the tongue have different
embryological origins and different nerve supplies. The junction is at the
sulcus terminalis, which is marked by the circumvallate papillae.
Motor supply to the tongue is via the hypoglossal nerve (CN12).
Sensation to the anterior two-thirds of the tongue is via the lingual nerve
(CN5). The posterior third is supplied by the glossopharyngeal nerve (CN9).
Taste fibers travel with the facial nerve (CN7) towards the middle ear.
The chorda typani carries the special sensory of taste fibers and exits the
middle ear to merge with the mandibular division of the trigeminal nerve.
At the tongue, the fibers are incorporated within the lingual nerve.
Muscles of the tongue The motion of the tongue is very complex and is
composed of sets of intrinsic and extrinsic muscles. The intrinsic muscles
do not have bony attachments and are aligned in different vectors to alter
the shape of the tongue. The extrinsic muscles move the tongue and have
attachments to the mandible, the styloid process, and the hyoid bone.
The extrinsic muscles are the genioglossus, hyoglossus, and styloglossus.

The palate
The palate consists of a bony hard palate composed primarily of maxillary
bone and a muscular soft palate. The palate serves to divide and separate
the mouth from the nose. The soft palate has a role in phonation, assists in
the patency of the eustachian tube, and forms a seal during deglutination.
Patients with velopharyngeal insufficiency complain of nasal regurgitation
of food during eating. The muscles of the soft palate include the tensor
veli palatine, the levator veli palatine, palatoglossus, and the palatopharyngeus. There is also a small muscle in the uvula called the musculus uvula.
All the muscles of the palate are innervated by the vagus nerve, with the
notable exception of the tensor veli palatini, which is innervated by the
mandibular branch of the trigeminal nerve CN5.

ANATOMY 1

Waldeyer’s ring
The mouth is a continuation of the gastrointestinal tract and is the
primary entry point for many potential pathogens. Waldeyer’s ring refers
to the ring of lymphoid tissue that circumferentially lines the oropharynx
and nasopharynx. The ring is composed of the paired palatine tonsils, the
pharyngeal tonsils or adenoids, and the lingual tonsils. Waldeyer’s ring
generally begins to proliferate from 1 to 3 years of age and peaks at
around age 5. During this period, it is common to get obstructive symptoms related to adenotonsillar hypertrophy. After puberty, the lymphoid
tissues begin to regress.

CHAPTER 5

The mouth, tonsils, and adenoids

Oral ulcers—benign
Traumatic ulcers
Acute traumatic ulcers heal quickly and rarely require medical attention.
Chronic traumatic ulcers are seen quite often. These can arise from illfitting dentures or sharp or rotten teeth, and usually occur on the lateral
aspect of the tongue, or on the inside of the cheek. Treatment consists
of dental review or refitting of the denture.

Aphthous ulcers
These common mouth ulcers, otherwise known as canker sores, start to
appear usually during childhood or adolescence as round or oval ulcerations with well-circumscribed margins, erythematous borders, and gray
or yellow centers. They are small and painful and most often affect the
lateral border or the tip of the tongue, although they may occur anywhere in the oral cavity. The exact etiology is unclear, although hormonal
changes, poor oral hygiene, trauma, poor diet, and stress have all been
suggested as factors. Predisposing factors include hematologic deficiency
(such as iron, folic acid, or vitamin B) in up to 20% of patients; gastrointestinal disorders causing malabsorption; and chronic exposure to sodium
lauryl sulfate, a common ingredient in oral health-care products.
Drugs such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) and alendronate have also been implicated. Aphthous ulcers also occur in Crohn’s
disease; celiac disease; Neumann bipolar aphthosis (genital ulcers may be
present); Behcet syndrome; HIV infection; neutropenia; periodic fever,
aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis, and cervical adenitis syndrome (PFAPA)
in children; and Sweet syndrome.
Aphthous ulcers affect 5%–66% of the population, with a slight female
predominance. They typically heal in 7–10 days. Occasionally they are
severe and recurrent and last longer. Treatment in this case should consist of simple analgesia, local anesthetic gels, or topical steroid. Topical
corticosteroids can help with the symptoms but do not reduce the rate
of recurrence. Commonly used preparations include trimaicinolone
acetonide in carboxymethyl cellulose paste (Adcortyl in orabase,
Kenlaog) applied four times a day. Rarely, a single giant aphthous ulcer
may develop. Occasionally, biopsy may be necessary to distinguish
between a long-standing ulcer and malignancy. Care should be taken to
biopsy the border of the ulcer to obtain a portion of intact epithelium for
histologic evaluation.

Infective ulcers
Herpes labialis can be caused by herpes simplex virus (HSV) I and HSV II.
Primary infection is usually asymptomatic. For those who are symptomatic, gingivostomatitis and pharyngitis are common. Lesions around the
mouth can also occur. Typical signs of the initial infection are fever, malaise, mylagia, and cervical adenopathy lasting 3–14 days. After a latency
period, reactivation can occur in 20%–40% of people and is characterized
by vesicles and ulcerations around the mouth, known as cold sores or
fever blisters. Ulcerations can occur inside the mouth, on the lips, or on
the face.

ORAL ULCERS—BENIGN 1

When herpes labialis occurs inside the mouth, it can be confused with
aphthous ulcers. Herpes labialis tends to recur in the same place, in
contrast to aphthous ulcers, which occur in different places. There is
usually a prodrome preceding reactivated HSV episodes, with tingling,
pain, and erythema occurring at the site. Precipitating factors include
ultraviolet (UV) light, fever, stress, premenstruation, and procedures
affecting the site such as dental or oral surgery, injections, or laser procedures. Before such surgical procedures, premedication with acyclovir
may be recommended, especially in those with a history of cold sores.
Herpes labialis is transmitted through direct contact with skin.
The highest chance of transmission of the virus is when there is an active
lesion present.
Diagnosis is made on the basis of clinical presentation. Oral treatment
consists of acyclovir or valacyclovir. Valacyclovir 2 g bid for 1 day has
been demonstrated to shorten healing time and pain during recurrent
episodes. Acyclovir 200–400 mg five times a day for 5 days and Famvir
500 mg tid for 5 days can also be given. If a person develops frequent
reactivations, chronic suppression treatment may be considered.
Another infectious cause of mouth lesions is syphilis, caused by
Treponema pallidum. Primary syphilis usually presents as a painless ulceration in the genitalia (“chancre”) and rarely may present in the mouth.
Secondary syphilis, with its more protean manisfestations (syphilis is often
referred to as the “great imitator”) can occur as small papules on the
corner of the mouth, known as “split papules.” The treatment of choice is
penicillin.

Dietary and blood disorders
Ulcerative stomatitis is often the product of underlying systemic disorders.
Deficiencies in iron, folate, and vitamin B12 can cause oral ulceration, since
these agents are required for normal mucosal development. Mouth ulcers
also occur as a result of leukemia, polycythemia, and agranulocytosis.
Signs of scurvy and pellagra include a sore mouth and ulceration. These
ulcerations are generally larger and more widespread. Behcet syndrome
is a poorly understood systemic disorder involving recurrent oral ulcers
and either eye, skin, or genital ulcerations.

Systemic disorders
The mouth is a continuation of the gastrointestinal tract and can have
ulcerations as part of inflammatory bowel disease. Conditions associated
with drug allergies such as Stevens Johnson syndrome have oral ulcerations.

Torus palatinus
This is a benign osteoma on the hard palate. Its surface may become
ulcerated, usually as a result of trauma. In this case the lesion may look
and feel malignant. These lesions need only be removed if they repeatedly
become infected or interfere with the fitting of a dental plate.

89

CHAPTER 5

The mouth, tonsils, and adenoids

Oral ulcers—malignant
Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)
This is the most common malignant lesion found in the mouth.
The appearance can vary considerably and range from erythematous
patches to exophytic ulcerations. The primary risk factors are tobacco
(smoking and chewing) and alcohol use. Other risk factors include chewing
betel nuts and poor oral hygiene. Viral risk factors include the presence of
HSV and human papilloma virus. There is an estimated annual incidence of
30,000 new oral cancers with approximately 4800 deaths per year in the
United States.
Symptoms and signs
Squamous cell carcinomas are lesions of the mucosal epithelium.
The appearance can vary but they often look irregular and keratotic with
areas of ulceration. These ulcers progress and may become painful, often
with referred pain to the ear. Pain often denotes invasion or infiltration
into adjacent sensory nerves or infection. Malignant ulcers of the tongue
may be superficial or deeply infiltrating. They usually feel firm and irregular to palpation. Other symptoms include difficulty swallowing and weight
loss or a neck mass.
Investigations
More information can usually be gathered from palpation than from
inspection. It is vital to adequately examine the neck for lymph node
metastasis, paying particular attention to the submandibular and submental triangles as well as those nodes deep to the sternomastoid running
along the internal jugular vein. SCC of the oral cavity will most commonly metastasize to the nodes in levels 1, 2, and 3 (see p. 102).
An MRI or CT scan is most often used to assess the neck. A finding of
enlarged lymph nodes greater than 1–1.5 cm in the presence of known
SCC is usually sufficient to warrant neck dissection. In skilled hands,
ultrasound-guided FNA is a highly sensitive and specific tool in assessing
the neck.
Management
Any ulcer that fails to heal within 2 weeks should be biopsied to exclude
malignancy. Many patients who develop oral-cavity SCC have widespread
mucosal-field change as a result of their smoking and drinking. They are
at a high risk of developing another upper aerodigestive tract cancer at
the same time or at some time in the future. All patients presenting with
SCC should have a panendoscopy under general anesthetic to exclude
any additional primary tumor. The panendoscopy will also allow proper
assessment of the primary tumor.
Treatment
Treatment and management of oral SCC are dependent on tumor size,
lymph node spread, and presence of distant metastasis. The American
Joint Commission on Cancer (AJCC) uses a T, N, M staging method for
head and neck cancer (Table 5.1). Options include external beam and
interstitial radiotherapy as well as surgical en-bloc resection. The surgically

CHAPTER 5

The mouth, tonsils, and adenoids

White patches in the mouth
There are many possible causes of white patches in the mouth. These
causes are described below.

Candida
Candida tends to occur in debilitated and immunocompromised patients.
White specs coalesce to form patches, or a white membrane, which
when lifted reveals a red, raw mucosal surface. It sometimes occurs on
the soft palate and can complicate the use of steroid inhalers in asthma
patients. Candida is usually diagnosed by seeing it, but if any doubt
remains, scrapings of the lesion should be taken and sent for microbiological examination.

Leukoplakia
Although any white patch in the mouth can be called leukoplakia, the
term usually refers to hyperkeratosis of the oral mucosa. This happens to
patients who share the same risk factors as those who develop SCC:
smoking, alcohol, and prolonged irritation from sharp teeth or poorly
fitting dentures. This lesion is premalignant and 3% of patients will undergo
malignant change within 5 years of diagnosis. A biopsy and regular reviews
are essential.
A particular form of leukoplakia known as oral hairy leukoplakia occurs
in immunocompromised and immunocompetent HIV patients. It may also
occur in HIV-negative patients who have hematologic malignancies.
The condition is thought to be caused by the Epstein–Barr virus and
appears as painless white plaques on the lateral aspect of the tongue.
They may be smooth or hairy or feathery with prominent projections.
They frequently appear and disappear spontaneously.

Oral lichen planus
This T-cell-mediated autoimmune condition occurs on the buccal
mucosa, gingiva, and tongue. Onset is typically during adulthood, with a
female predilection and association with other autoimmune diseases such
as alopecia areata, dermatomyositis, lichen sclerosus et atrophicus, or
primary biliary cirrhosis. Lesions have a white, reticulated, lace-like appearance. Ulcerations or erosions may be present. Two-thirds of cases may be
extremely painful, especially if lesions are ulcerative. Thalidomide has been
reported to be a successful treatment.

Mucus retention cysts
These cysts usually form a smooth, pale, round protuberance and can
occur anywhere in the oral cavity, base of the tongue, or tonsils. These
swellings arise from a blockage in one of the many mucus glands found
throughout the mucosa of the upper aerodigestive tract. Reassurance is
usually all that is required. If there is any diagnostic uncertainty, or if they
become large enough to cause symptoms, excision or marsupialization
may be required.

CHAPTER 5

The mouth, tonsils, and adenoids

Miscellaneous mouth conditions
Geographic tongue
Also known as benign migratory glossitis, this is a common, benign condition that occurs in 3% of the population. Atrophy of the filiform papillae
results in red patches with a white border. Although lesions are usually
asymptomatic, some patients have noted increased sensitivity to hot and
spicy food. The sites of predilection vary and seem to move around the
tongue. The cause is unknown, but it often runs in families and there is an
increased prevalence among people with psoriasis. Reassurance is the
only treatment required.

Angioedema
This allergic reaction causes generalized swelling of the tongue. Seafood,
peanuts, and drugs such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors
can all have this effect. The swelling may progress rapidly and obstruct the
airway. Medical treatment consists of intravenous steroids, diphenhydramine, and racemic epinephrine. The airway may need to be secured by
either endotracheal intubation or tracheotomy.

Median rhomboid glossitis
This appears as a raised, smooth plaque in the center of the dorsum of
the tongue. It has been linked with reflux and candida infection. In most
cases, simple reassurance is all that is required. Antifungal treatment can
be helpful to reduce redness and inflammation associated with candida
infection. Some lesions disappear after antifungal therapy.

Tongue tie
Ankyloglossia is a birth defect in which tongue movement is restricted
due to the abnormal attachment of the base of the tongue toward the tip
of the tongue. This condition is often hereditary. Tongue tie can cause
feeding problems in infants. In some children, it can cause speech problems. Surgical division can be easily performed in the office with few
adverse effects.

Macroglossia
Enlargement of the tongue can be seen in acromegaly, Down syndrome,
multiple endocrine adenoma syndrome, hypothyroidism, and amyloidosis.

Burning tongue syndrome
Patients with this condition complain of a burning sensation of the tongue,
lips, gums, palate, throat, or throughout the mouth. It tends to occur in
middle-aged to older adults, with a higher frequency among women. Its
cause is unknown and treatment is tailored to the individual on the basis
of specific underlying etiology, such as xerostomia (dryness), infectious
causes such as thrush, or psychological factors.

Hairy oral leukoplakia
This condition appears as white patches on the lateral border of the
tongue in patients with AIDS.

MISCELLANEOUS MOUTH CONDITIONS 1

Black hairy tongue
This aptly named condition occurs from overgrowth of the filiform papillae
of the tongue and generally occurs in smokers. Treatment consists of
brushing the tongue with a soft toothbrush.

Ranula
This is a retention cyst that forms in the floor of the mouth under the
tongue. It develops from the submandibular or sublingual glands. It is
treated by marsupialization and removal of the adjacent sublingual gland.

Cystic hygroma
This is a benign tumor of the lymph vessels (lymphangioma) that consists
of large, dilated lymphatic channels. The nomenclature can be confusing
and they can also be referred to as macrocystic lymphangiomas.
They usually present at or soon after birth and can grow to massive
proportions. These tumors may cause life-threatening compression of the
airway. They may be injected with a sclerosing agent (OK432, alcohol) or
surgically excised.

CHAPTER 5

The mouth, tonsils, and adenoids

Pharyngitis
Pharyngitis describes any inflammation of the throat and is one of the
most common infections in medicine. Pharyngitis can have many different
causes, including infectious (viral is far more common than bacterial),
traumatic, and caustic causes, laryngopharyngeal reflux, allergy, and smoking.

Common agents causing infectious pharyngitis
- Viral: adenovirus, rhinovirus, herpes simplex virus (ulcerations),
coxsackievirus (herpangina or hand-foot-mouth disease), and Epstein–
Barr virus (infectious mononucleosis)
- The most common bacteria are streptococci, pneumocci, and
H. influenzae.
- Corynebacterium diphtheria, characterized by grayish exudates
- Bordetella pertussis results in pharyngitis with tracheobronchitis and
causes whooping cough.
- Neisseria gonorrhea is often sexually transmitted. It may be associated
with joint pain and meningitis.

Group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus pharyngitis
Group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus (GABHS) is one of the most
common causes of bacterial pharyngitis and is associated with the development of rheumatic fever, scarlet fever, and glomerulonephritis. For this
reason, group A streptococcus should be suspected and treated in all
cases of acute severe pharyngitis.
- Testing includes GABHS rapid antigen test (70%–90% sensitive), throat
culture, and antistreptolysin-O (ASO) antibody.
- Treat with antibiotics. Penicillin is still effective.

Rheumatic fever
Rheumatic fever (RF) is characterized by diffuse swelling and inflammation
involving soft tissue, the heart, joints, and blood vessels. The process is
incompletely understood and may be secondary to systemic release of
inflammatory mediators or instigation of an autoimmune process by the
strep antigen. This occurs more often in children from ages 5 to 15 years.
The incidence of RF is approximately 3% in untreated strep pharyngitis.
Although rarely seen today, RF used to be one of the leading causes of
cardiac valve disease worldwide and is still a significant public health issue
in developing countries.
The cell surface marker of the group A streptococcus is called the
M-protein, which has been linked to the pathophysiology of RF, poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis, and scarlet fever.
Diagnosis is based on Jones Criteria: two major or one major + two
minor criteria are required in addition to proven infection with group A
streptococcus.
- Previous streptococcus infection as documented by positive culture or
rapid antigen testing and/or elevation in streptococcal antibody test
(ASO).

PHARYNGITIS 1

- Major criteria include carditis, Aschoff bodies (subcutaneous nodules),
erythema marginatum, migratory polyarthritis, and Sydenham’s chorea.
- Minor criteria include arthralgia, fever, elevated acute-phase reactants
on serology, and prolonged PR interval on electrocardiogram (EKG).

Scarlet fever
Scarlet fever is characterized by diffuse swelling and inflammation involving
soft tissue, skin, and mucosa secondary to bacterial exotoxins. These
exotoxins enable the spread of infection and are responsible for most of
the local and systemic toxicity of these organisms. Pyrogenic or erythrogenic exotoxins are components linked to the development of the rash
associated with scarlet fever.
- Signs and symptoms inlcude skin erythema (scarlet) and strawberry
tongue.
- Dick test involves the intradermal injection of isolated erythogenic
toxin. Susceptible individuals produce a local wheal and flare reaction.

Post streptococcal glomerulonephritis
Glomerulonephritis occurs about 7–14 days after the initial infection.
Most cases occur after strep pharyngitis but can also occur after skin infections such as impetigo. It is thought to be the result of immune-complex
deposition within the kidney or the stimulation of autoantibodies.
- Signs and symptoms include gross hematuria, generalized edema, mild
hypertension, flank pain, oligouria, and retinal hemorrhages. It can lead
to chronic kidney failure.
- Urinalysis shows red blood cells (RBC) and RBC casts.
- Treatment is supportive and most patients make a full functional
recovery.

CHAPTER 5

The mouth, tonsils, and adenoids

Tonsillitis
Tonsillitis, or infection of the tonsils, is commonly seen in ENT and general
practice. Common bacterial pathogens are B-hemolytic streptococcus,
moraxella, catarrhalis, and Hemophilus influenzae. Sometimes this occurs
following an initial viral infection. Treatment consists of appropriate
antibiotics, regular simple analgesia, oral fluids, and bed rest.

Signs of acute tonsillitis
-

Sore throat
Enlargement of the tonsils
Exudate on the tonsils
Difficulty swallowing
Fever
Malaise
Halitosis
Ear pain
Trismus

Complications of tonsillitis
Airway obstruction This is very rare, but may occur in tonsillitis due to
mononucleosis. The patient may experience severe snoring and acute
sleep apnea. This may require rapid intervention, e.g., insertion of nasopharyngeal airway or intubation.
Quinsy (peritonsillar abscess) This appears as a swelling of the soft palate
and tissues lateral to the tonsil, with displacement of the uvula towards
the opposite side. The patient is usually toxic with fever, trismus, and
drooling. Needle aspiration or incision and drainage is required, along
with antibiotics, which are usually administered intravenously.
Parapharyngeal abscess This is a serious complication of tonsillitis and
usually presents as a diffuse swelling in the neck. Other deep neck space
infections are also possible with tonsillitis, either from extension from the
peritonsillar space or via suppurative lymphadenitis. Admission is required
and surgical drainage is often necessary via an external neck incision.

Management
Patients with complicated tonsillitis and those who are unable to take
enough fluid orally will need to be admitted to the hospital for rehydration, analgesia, and intravenous antibiotics. Ampicillin should be avoided if
there is any question of mononucleosis, because of the florid skin rash
which will occur.

INFECTIOUS MONONUCLEOSIS 1

Infectious mononucleosis
Infectious mononucleosis (“mono”) is also known as glandular fever or
Epstein–Barr virus infection. It is common in teenagers and young adults.
Patients with mono may present a similar picture to that of patients with
acute bacterial tonsillitis, but with a slightly longer history of symptoms.
Diagnosis relies on a positive monospot or Paul–Bunnell blood test
(heterophil antibodies in serum), although early in the course of the
disease this test can still show up negative.

Signs and symptoms
-

Sore throat
Fever
Cervical lymphadenopathy
White slough on tonsils
Petechial hemorrhages on the palate
Marked widespread lymphadenopathy
Hepatosplenomegaly

Treatment
This is a self-limiting condition and treatment is largely supportive with
painkillers, although patients may appreciate a short course of corticosteroids to decrease swelling. Intravenous (IV) fluids may be necessary if
they cannot drink enough.

Complications
Patients should be advised to refrain from contact sports for 6 weeks
because of the risk of a ruptured spleen, which can lead to lifethreatening internal bleeding. Ampicillin is associated with a rash and
should be avoided. Rarely, hemolytic anemia may be severe.

CHAPTER 5

The mouth, tonsils, and adenoids

Tonsillectomy
This is one of the most commonly performed operations.

Indications for tonsillectomy
- Suspected malignancy in the presence of asymmetric tonsil or unusualappearing tonsil (absolute indication)
- Children with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and/or cor pulmonale
(absolute indication)
- As part of another procedure, such as ulvulopalatoplasty (UPP) for
snoring
- Recurrent acute tonsillitis
- Three attacks per year for 3 years or
- Five attacks in any one year
- More than one quinsy
Big tonsils that are asymptomatic need not be removed. Removing the
tonsils does not always prevent tonsillitis; remember the adenoids and
lingual tonsils. It also does not prevent pharyngitis.
There are numerous methods for the removal of tonsils. Complete
tonsillectomy involves dissecting the tonsils off the muscles of the fossa.
Subcapsular tonsillectomy removes and debulks the tonsillar tissue, preserving the surrounding capsule. This technique has been used for
obstructive sleep symptoms without significant infections.

Postoperative
Tonsillectomy is very painful. Patients should be advised that referred pain
to the ear is common. Until the tonsillar fossa are completely healed,
eating is very uncomfortable. Generally a soft diet is recommended
postoperatively. Narcotics are generally needed.
In the immediate postoperative period, the tonsillar fossa becomes
coated with a white exudate, which can be mistaken as a sign of infection.

Complications
Postoperative hemorrhage is a serious complication and occurs in
approximately 2%–4% of cases.
- Immediate postoperative hemorrhage can occur in the first few hours
after the operation; this will frequently necessitate a return trip to the
operating room. This may be secondary to incomplete hemostasis,
rupture of a vessel, release of a vasospastic artery, or hypertension.
- A secondary hemorrhage can occur any time within 2 weeks of the
operation. It occurs because of neoangiogenesis within the wound bed.
See Chapter 20, p. 424.
- The combination of postoperative nausea, vomiting, and dehydration is
one of the most common reasons for hospital admission. Treatment is
with pain control and IV fluids.

TONSILLECTOMY 1

- Postoperative flash pulmonary edema is a rare but frightening condition
in which the lungs fill up rapidly with fluid. This occurs as a response to
the sudden decrease in airway pressure after relieving obstruction. It has
been reported after tonsillectomy as well as after sleep apnea surgery.
Treatment includes diuresis and intubation with the goals of increasing
the pulmonary back pressure.
- Eagle’s syndrome is a condition described as occurring after tonsillectomy. The hallmarks are persistent ear and throat pain with evidence
of reactive calcification and fibrosis of the stylohyoid ligament or an
elongated styloid process. Palpation of the tonsillar fossa should
reproduce the pain. Diagnosis must be done very carefully and other
disorders must be ruled out. Surgical treatment with removal of the
styloid process and ligament has been used as treatment.

101

102

CHAPTER 5

The mouth, tonsils, and adenoids

Tonsillar tumors
Benign tumors of the tonsils are very rare. But tonsillar stones (tonsiliths)
with surrounding ulceration, mucus retention cysts, herpes simplex, or
giant aphthous ulcers may mimic the more common malignant tumors of
the tonsil.

Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)
This is the most common tumor of the tonsil and is staged as oropharyngeal
cancers in the AJCC guidelines. The other subsites within the oropharynx
include the soft palate, base of tongue, and the lateral and posterior
pharyngeal walls. Except for the posterior pharyngeal wall, there is a rich
lymphatic drainage network from these areas and an early propensity for
lymphatic involvement. Tonsillar SCC tends to occur in middle-aged and
elderly people, but in recent years tonsillar SCC has become more frequent in patients under the age of 40. Many of these patients are also
unusual candidates for SCC because they are nonsmokers and nondrinkers.
Signs and symptoms
- Pain in the throat
- Referred otalgia
- Ulcer on the tonsil
- Lump in the neck.
As the tumor grows it may affect the patient’s ability to swallow and it
may lead to an alteration in the voice—this is known as “hot potato
speech.”
Diagnosis is usually confirmed with a biopsy taken at the time of the
staging panendoscopy. Fine-needle aspiration of any neck mass is also
necessary. Imaging usually entails CT, MRI, and/or PET scan. It is important
to exclude any synchronous head and neck or pulmonary tumor as well as
metastatic disease with a chest X-ray and/or a chest CT scan.
Treatment
Treatment and management are dependent on the tumor size, lymph
node spread, and distant metastasis.
Treatment options include the following:
- Radiotherapy alone
- Chemoradiotherapy
- Transoral laser surgery
- En-bloc surgical excision—this removes the primary and the affected
nodes from the neck. Oropharyngeal cancers can be difficult to expose
and often involve transfacial or transmandibular approaches. Robotic
surgery may be making advancements in resection.
- Often it will be necessary to reconstruct the surgical defect to allow for
adequate speech and swallowing afterward. Reconstructing the oropharyx and palate is difficult, and residual dysfunction is not uncommon.
Reconstruction can vary from free tissue transfer, such as a radial
forearm free flap, to the manufacture of a prosthetic or obturator.

TONSILLAR TUMORS 1

Lymphoma
This is the second most common tonsil tumor.
Signs and symptoms
- Enlargement of one of the tonsils
- Lymphadenopathy in the neck—may be large
- Mucosal ulceration—less common than in SCC
Investigations
Fine-needle aspiration cytology may suggest lymphoma, but it rarely
confirms the diagnosis. The specimens should be sent with a cell block in
normal saline so that flow cytometry may be performed. A sample with
cell architecture may be taken in an easily accessible lymph node with a
true-cut or core biopsy needle used for liver biopsy. However, it is often
necessary to perform an excision biopsy of one of the nodes. Because
neck dissection is the standard protocol for removing SCC, excisional
biopsy of an unexpected SCC can produce a problem associated with
potentially seeding the neck with cancer and disrupting the normal system
of lymphatic drainage.
Staging is necessary with imaging of the neck, chest, abdomen, and
pelvis. Further surgical intervention is not required other than to secure a
threatened airway.
Treatment
This usually consists of chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy.

CHAPTER 5

The mouth, tonsils, and adenoids

Adenoidal enlargement
The adenoid is a collection of loose lymphoid tissue found in the space
at the back of the nose. The eustachian tubes open immediately lateral to
the adenoids. Enlargement of the adenoids is very common, especially in
children. It may happen as a result of repeated upper respiratory tract
infections (URTIs), which occur in children because of their poorly
developed immune systems.

Signs and symptoms
-

Nasal obstruction and congestion
Nasal quality to the voice
Mouth breathing, which may interfere with eating
Rhinorrhea
Snoring
Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS)
Blockage of the eustachian tube with recurrent or chronic otitis media.

A diagnosis of adenoidal enlargement is usually suspected from the history.
Use of a mirror or an endoscopic nasal examination will confirm the
diagnosis.
The glue ear that arises as a result of poor eustachian tube function may
cause hearing impairment. Adenoiditis, or infection of the adenoid, may
allow ascending infections to reach the middle ear via the eustachian tube.

Treatment
An adenoidectomy is performed under a general anesthetic. The adenoids
are usually removed using suction diathermy or curettage.

Complications
Hemorrhage (primary, reactionary, and secondary) This is a serious
complication of an adenoidectomy, but is less common than with a
tonsillectomy.
Velopharyngeal insufficiency (VPI) and nasal regurgitation The soft
palate acts as a flap valve and separates the nasal and the oral cavity. If the
adenoid is removed in patients who have even a minor palatal abnormality,
it can have major effects on speech and swallowing. Velopharyngeal
incompetence can occur in these patients, resulting in nasal regurgitation
of liquids and air escape during speech. Patients with a cleft palate, bifid
uvula, or submucosal palatal cleft are at high risk for developing this complication. Assessment of the palate should form part of the routine ENT
examination before such an operation.

CHAPTER 5

The mouth, tonsils, and adenoids

Obstructive sleep apnea
Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a major public health problem and
results in neurocognitive problems (poor productivity and accidents) as
well as cardiovascular and pulmonary complications. Snoring and OSA
are associated but distinct entities. Snoring is very commonly observed,
whereas OSA is associated with specific findings on sleep study as well as
clinical features of sleep deprivation. OSA affects approximately 1%–4%
of middle-aged men. In children, upper airway resistance syndrome
(UARS) is similar to OSA and is generally associated with adenotonsillar
hypertrophy. In adults, OSA can be the result of narrowing anywhere in
the upper respiratory tract.

Sleep apnea
- Obstructive sleep apnea: problem breathing during sleep secondary to
anatomic obstruction of the upper airway. This is a much more common
entity than central sleep apnea. Usually there is anatomic narrowing of
the upper airway, which is further narrowed when supine and when the
muscles of the pharynx and oral cavity are relaxed, resulting in reduced
patency of the airway against the negative pressure created during
inspiration.
- Central sleep apnea: problem with the breathing drive centers, often in
the brainstem. This is not usually associated with the physical findings
of OSA. It occurs more often in infants and in the elderly.

Signs and symptoms
-

Snoring
Apneas and hypopneas (see below)
Arousals—nighttime awakenings, often gasping for breath
Daytime somnolence
Poor sleep and insomnia
Morning headaches

Sleep study
A sleep study measures multiple components of sleep, including electroencephalography (EEG) activity, EMG, leg movements, airflow monitor of
respiration, EKG, oxygen saturation, and snoring sounds. The following
definitions and indices are used:
- Apnea is cessation of breathing and airflow for at least 10 seconds.
- Hypopnea is reduced ventilation of at least 50% for at least 10 seconds,
followed by an arousal and/or drop in oxygen saturation.
- Apnea-Hypopnea Index (AHI) = Apnea per hour + Hypopnea per hour.
An AHI greater than 10 is considered abnormal.
- Respiratory effort-related arousal (RERA)
- Respiratory disturbance index (RDI) = Apnea per hour + Hypopnea
per hour + RERA per hour. RDI greater than 15 is considered
abnormal.

OBSTRUCTIVE SLEEP APNEA 1

Complications and natural history
- Chronic sleep deprivation has been associated with motor vehicle
accidents, poor job performance, and mood alterations.
- Cardiac conditions associated with OSA include hypertension, cardiovascular disease, myocardial infarction, and stroke.
- Pulmonary complications include pulmonary hypertension and cor
pulmonale.

Medical treatments
Treatment should be geared toward treating any medical comorbidities,
weight loss, and any respiratory issues such as asthma, emphysema, and
nasal congestion or allergies.
- Behavioral treatment includes weight reduction, avoidance of respiratory depressants such as alcohol for sleep, positional changes during
sleep (avoiding supine position), and head elevation. A 10% reduction
in weight is associated with a 25% improvement in AHI. Avoiding airway
irritants such as smoking and controlling allergies are also helpful.
- Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is the most reliable
treatment for OSA. The CPAP machine is essentially an air compressor and blower that delivers a constant pressure to the airway.
This “pneumatic splint” helps maintain airway patency. The patient is
required to wear a tight-fitting mask over the nose and or mouth at
night. The major obstacle to therapy is patient compliance, which is
reported to be approximately 60%.
- Oral splints are intraoral devices that can help a select group of
patients maintain airway patency. The splints generally work by helping
advance the mandible forward and increasing the distance between the
posterior pharyngeal wall and the base of tongue.

Surgery for obstructive sleep apnea
The success of surgical treatment for OSA has been variable. Although
short-term results of most procedures are successful, long-term reduction and improvement in AHI or RDI are less impressive. Because of the
variability in anatomy and the multiple sites of potential airway blockage,
a single operation or approach is difficult to apply. There are some surgeries
with high success at treating snoring but variable success for OSA.
- Uvulapharyngopalatoplasty (UPPP) involves removing the uvula, tonsils,
faucial arches, and a portion of the soft palate and advancing the soft
palate forward. It is the most common surgery for OSA, with a
reported success rate of approximately 50%.
- Palatoplasty has been performed in a variety of ways. Laser, sclerosing
agents, implantable pillars, radiofrequency waves, and coblation have
been used to alter and stiffen the palate to reduce airway obstruction
and snoring.

107

108

CHAPTER 5

The mouth, tonsils, and adenoids

- Mandibular and maxillary advancement involves controlled osteotomies to enlarge the pharyngeal airway. The reported success rate has
been approximately 90%, but the procedure is associated with significant
morbidity.
- Tracheotomy has been performed for severe OSA and is considered a
surgical option. Results are very good; however, symptoms must be
severe, and very few patients are willing to undergo this procedure.

CHAPTER 6

The nose and sinuses

Structure and function of the nose
Structure
The structure of the nose is made up of four parts:
- The surface anatomy—see Fig. 6.1 for the surface landmarks.
- The nasal skeleton—composed of the two nasal bones, the paired
upper lateral and lower lateral alar cartilages, and the nasal septum,
covered in subcutaneous tissue and skin (see Fig. 6.2).
- The internal anatomy, which includes the septum of the nose, which
forms the medial wall of the nasal cavity. The septum is composed of a
quadrangular-shaped cartilage anterior and a portion of the ethmoid
bone called the perpendicular plate posterior. The septum articulates
onto the floor of the nose on the vomer bone. There are four pairs of
bony turbinates on the lateral wall. Also called concha (the Latin term
for scroll, see Fig. 6.3), these structures serve to direct air posterior,
reduce turbulence, and increase surface area contact for the mucosa.
Each turbinate encloses a space termed the meatus. Various outlets for
the paranasal sinuses and nasolacrimal duct flow into these meatal
spaces.
- The osteomeatal complex (OMC) (Fig. 6.4) is a region within the
middle meatus that forms the outflow tracts of the maxillary, frontal,
and ethmoid sinuses. This is a key functional area of the nose underneath the middle turbinate. Understanding the anatomy of the OMC is
essential to understanding the etiology of sinus disease (see Fig. 6.5).
Knowing the anatomical terms for parts of the nose helps you to
describe the site of lesions accurately as well as document the findings of
examinations accurately.

Function
The nose is the main route for inspired air, and its structure is related to
this function. As the air passes over the large surface area of the turbinates,
the inspired gases are warmed and humidified. Mucus on the mucosa of the
nose removes large dust particles from the air. The nasal cavity allows for
chemicals and odorants to stimulate the olfactory neuroepithelium at the
region of the cribriform plate.
The voice resonates in the sinuses and nose, and this provides character
to the speech. Patients with very obstructed nasal passages have what is
often described as a nasal quality to their speech.
Pneumatization of the sinuses, which are air-filled spaces, reduces the
weight of the skull and may also have developed as a crumple zone to
protect the brain from injury.

CHAPTER 6

The nose and sinuses

Rhinitis
Rhinitis is an inflammation of the nasal lining. Rhinitis may be diagnosed if
a patient has two out of three of the following symptoms for more than
1 hour every day for over 2 weeks.

Symptoms
- Blocked nose and nasal congestion
- Rhinorrhea or running nose—including postnasal drip
- Sneezing
This condition is very common. Approximately one in six adults suffers
from rhinitis.

Causes
There are a multitude of factors that cause rhinitis. It may be caused
by several different factors, so it is important to treat each different
cause. The symptoms of rhinitis may also be part of systemic disease
(see Table 6.1).
The most common forms of rhinitis are allergic and infective. Classification of the disease is shown in Table 6.1.

History
It is important to take a full history to determine the cause of rhinitis.
History of atopy or asthma, and any seasonal variation in the symptoms
are relevant to diagnosis. Documenting the main symptoms—blockage,
running, and sneezing—and noting which one is predominant will help in
treatment selection.
The patients should be asked what medications are being used and
about their smoking history—almost every smoker has a degree of rhinitis.
The patient should be asked about any previous treatment for rhinitis,
including its duration and effectiveness.

Investigations
- Anterior rhinoscopy—used to look for enlarged swollen turbinates
(a blue tinge often indicates an allergic rhinitis) or nasal polyps.
- Rigid nasal endoscopy—used to examine the middle meatus for
mucopus, polyps, and patency of the ostia.
- Skin allergy tests—performed for the testing of environmental allergies. Several different forms of the test are available. All involve the
placement of tiny amounts of test substances on the skin. For skin
prick and intradermal testing, a pin prick is made—a positive result
leads to a small raised, red, itchy patch, which can be quantified. These
tests are very sensitive and specific, and skin testing can be used as
basis for immunomodulation therapy.
- Radioallergosorbent test (RAST)—a blood test that measures IgE levels
to various substrates.
- Peak flow—there is a high degree of association between rhinitis and
asthma. Peak flow measures the amount of airflow that can be generated during forced expulsion of air. Peak flows are reduced with
asthma and are measured with pulmonary function testing.

CHAPTER 6

The nose and sinuses

Medical treatment of rhinitis
Treatment of rhinitis is related to the underlying etiology of the condition.

Allergen avoidance
If the patient’s rhinitis is caused by an allergy, skin prick testing can identify
allergens to be avoided. It gives visual feedback to the patient to confirm
the diagnosis. Following a positive skin prick test, allergen-avoidance
information can be given.

Pharmacological treatments
Each of the different medications has different effects on symptoms (see
Table 6.2).
- Steroids should ideally be delivered topically to the nasal mucosa as
sprays or drops. When using drops, it is important to administer in the
correct position, i.e., head down. Oral steroids can be very effective,
but their systemic effects limit their long-term use.
- Antihistamines—non-sedating antihistamines are effective against
sneezing, itching, and watery rhinorrhea. Used systemically they can be
effective for other atopic problems such as watery eyes. They are not
useful for symptoms of blockage.
- Topical nasal decongestants such as neosynephrine and oxymetazolone
are only useful in the short term at the start of other therapy or for
flying. Prolonged use can produce intractable rhinorrhea of rhinitis
medicamentosa secondary to chronic vascoconstriction.
- Systemic decongestants such as phenylephrine or pseudoephedrine are
useful in short courses but can elevate blood pressure and have
sympathetic side effects.
- Ipratropium bromide is an anticholinergic medication commonly used
for asthma treatment. An intranasal preparation is effective for watery
vasomotor type rhinitis.
- Sodium cromoglycate is a mast cell stabilizer that prevents the
degranulation of mast cells and is useful for allergic rhinitis.

CHAPTER 6

The nose and sinuses

Surgical treatment of nasal obstruction
Rhinitis is considered a disease of the nasal mucosa, thus the role of
surgery is limited. The primary goal of surgery is to improve nasal airflow
and eliminate obstruction of sinus ostia. Surgery to improve nasal function may be a useful adjunct to other treatments. Even if a surgically
correctable problem is found, it is worth a trial of medical therapy alone
in the first instance as this often brings a high rate of symptom resolution.
It is also worth obtaining a CT scan of the paranasal sinuses if surgery is
considered, to review the need for sinus surgery.

Turbinate reduction
The turbinates often hypertrophy in all types of rhinitis, but particularly in
allergic rhinitis. Their hypertrophy often obstructs the airway to such a
degree that it is impossible to deliver topical medication. Reduction can
be achieved by several means:
- Surface linear cautery—burning the surface
- Submucous diathermy—burning under the surface
- Cryotherapy—freezing
- Outfracture—lateralizing the turbinates out of the airway
- Submucosal conchopexy—changing the shape of the turbinate
- Trimming or excising the turbinate
Although these techniques are effective in improving the airway, additional
medical therapy is often needed to prevent recurrence of the hypertrophied mucosa. The technique of turbinate excision has the potential for
the development of atrophic rhinitis, a disabling condition marked by nasal
congestion and the development of large obstructing crusts composed of
inspissated nasal secretions.

Septal surgery
A deviated septum may need to be corrected to improve nasal function
and help medication delivery. Techniques for septoplasty vary and include
resection of the deviated portion of the septum.

Functional endoscopic sinus surgery
This surgery is aimed at the osteomeatal complex—its goal is to remove
blockage in the critical area and restore the normal function and drainage
of the sinuses. It could benefit patients with sinusitis who do not respond
to medical treatments.

OLFACTION 1

Olfaction
Olfactory physiology
Olfaction is a special sensory pathway and is the result of binding between
environmental chemicals, the odorants, and olfactory receptor cells within
the nasal cavity. The olfactory cleft is the region just below the cribriform
plate. Neuroepithlial cells perforate the cribriform plate to gain exposure
to the nasal cavity. The olfactory nerve is the collective central processes
of the olfactory receptor cells. The region is notable because there is
direct contact between neurons and the environment. The trigeminal
nerve also participates in smell via sensory receptors in the nasal mucosa.
These receptors primarily respond to chemical irritants and are mediated
by neuropeptide P.

Olfactory dysfunction and loss of smell
Olfactory dysfunction can manifest itself in a variety of ways. Anosmia is
the inability to smell, whereas hyposmia is a decreased smelling acuity.
Dysosmia is disordered smell, usually of something unpleasant, and phantosmia is the sensation of odors that are not present.
Signs and symptoms Anosmia and hyposmia are the most frequent olfactory complaints and can be the result of disorders in the nasal cavity,
mucosa, neurons, or central nervous system. Nasal causes are generally
the result of mucosal abnormality and impaired respiration and delivery
of odorants to the olfactory cleft. Examples include rhinitis of any form,
smoking, nasal polyps, nasal septal deviation, and impaired mucociliary
action. Damage to the olfactory epithelium can occur as the result of
infection, head injury, cranial base surgery, or hemorrhage. Central nervous system disorders such as Parkinson disease and especially Alzheimer
disease are associated with smelling dysfunction. Systemic disorders such
as metabolic disorders (thiamine deficiency, hypothyroidism) and those
from toxin exposure can also impair olfaction. Kallman’s syndrome is a
congenital disorder characterized by midline neural fusion defects and is
characterized by anosmia in conjunction with an incomplete olfactory
stalk or hypothalamus in addition to hypogonadism. Dysosmia and phantosmia may be the result of temporal lobe disorders such as seizure or
depression.
Examination A careful and systemic evaluation of the nasal cavity and
nasopharynx should be performed. Taste complaints are commonly
associated with smelling symptoms and should be evaluated. Testing is
based on suspected etiology, but an evaluation of the nasal cavity and
sinuses should be made with endoscopy. A CT scan or MRI of the nose
and skull base can be ordered to evaluate for presence of mucosal thickening at the cribriform plate or chronic sinusitis or skull base neoplasm.
There are also objectives tests for smelling such as the University of
Pennsylvania Smell Identification test.
Treatment Treatment depends on the etiology and whether reversible
causes are addressed. For rhinitis and mucosal damage, nasal saline rinses
and nasal steroids are first line. Although the neuroepithelium can regenerate, the process may take years.

CHAPTER 6

The nose and sinuses

Sinusitis
Sinusitis is inflammation of the sinuses. It is often considered a continuation
of the spectrum of rhinitis and often occurs in conjunction with upper
respiratory tract infections (URTIs).
The work of Messerklinger has shown that effective sinus drainage
occurs through the osteomeatal complex (see Fig. 6.4, p. 113). The sinus
mucosa is lined with respiratory epithelium, which is ciliated pseudostratified columnar epithelium. The mucous environment is stratified
and composed of multiple layers. Mucocililary action directs the flow of
this layer into the sinus outflow tracts at a rate of approximately 1 cm
per second. The sinuses normally do not accumulate mucus. Obstruction
of the osteomeatal complex due to anatomical or mucosal problems
impairs sinus drainage and leads to obstructed outflow, which predispose
to infection. This can occur as an acute phenomenon (see p. 123) or as a
chronic condition (see p. 125). Recurrent attacks of sinusitis can create
an environment of chronic hypoxia and ciliary stasis.
Depending on the location of the infection, symptoms can vary from
facial pain and pressure to headaches and swelling. The four paired sinuses
vary in frequency of involvement and sinusitis can afflict all of them or
individually. The maxillary sinuses are the most frequently involved,
followed by the ethmoids, frontals, and sphenoid sinuses.

ACUTE SINUSITIS 1

Acute sinusitis
Acute sinusitis is defined as sinus inflammation of less than 4 weeks’
duration. It is one of the most common reasons for ambulatory visits and
is the fifth leading diagnosis for antibiotic use. It is caused by an acute
bacterial or viral infection and often develops after a preceding upper
respiratory tract infection.

Signs and symptoms
-

Preceding upper respiratory infection
Nasal obstruction and discharge
Severe facial pain over the sinuses, particularly the maxilla/cheeks
Pain that is worse on bending down or coughing.
Tenderness over the sinuses

Investigations
- An anterior rhinoscopy to examine the inside of the nose
- A rigid nasal endoscopy often shows pus in middle meatus or edematous mucosa. The mucopus usually drains posteriorly and can be seen
with the endoscope in the nasopharynx.
- The maxillary and frontal sinuses can be evaluated for absence of
transillumination. Normally in a clear sinus, a light source pressed
against the cheek (for maxillary) or the frontal (forehead) sinuses will
illuminate the cavity. For maxillary sinuses, transillumination is often
best seen in the mouth through the palate. If the sinus is filled with
fluid, there is no transillumination.
- Imaging for acute sinusitis is not routine. Facial X-rays can show
fluid-filled areas.

Treatment
In healthy adults, medication alone is usually effective.
- Antibiotics may be given if bacterial infection is suspected. Generally
antibiotics are prescribed for symptoms greater than 7 days’ duration
or for very severe symptoms. The most common community-acquired
pathogens are Streptococcus. pneumoniae, Haemophilu influenza, and
Moraxella catarrhalis. Anaerobic organisms are rare but can be associated with dental problems associated with the upper teeth. The length
of treatment is 7–10 days.
- Decongestant—oxymetolozine 0.5% nasal spray for 3–5 days only.
Systemic decongestants such as phenylephrine or pseudoephrine and
antihistamines can also be used.
- Saline nasal sprays several times per day or a netty pot to wash out
nasal secretions and crust. Steroid nasal sprays such as fluticasone nasal
spray can be administered for 2 weeks.
- If sinus symptoms do not resolve, consider a sinus washout or culture
and a CT scan of the paranasal sinuses.
In immunocompromised patients, consider a sinus washout and culture
to obtain microbiology for more effective antimicrobial treatment; do not
forget to culture and stain for fungal elements. Patterns of antibiotic
resistance vary from region to region.

123

CHAPTER 6

The nose and sinuses

Recurrent acute sinusitis
Patients presenting with a history of recurrent sinusitis are often difficult
to diagnose because, in the absence of an acute infection, there may be
no abnormal physical signs. Even CT scans may be entirely normal. If the
history is good and the CT shows anatomic predisposition for outflow
obstruction, then functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS) is appropriate if the number of episodes of infection is sufficient to cause disruption
to the person’s lifestyle.

Differential diagnosis of sinusitis
- Migraine—typical or nonclassical migraine symptoms may mimic sinus
symptoms, as can other headache disorders.
- Dental problems
- Temporomandibular joint disorders
- Trigeminal neuralgia
- Neuralgias of uncertain origin
- Atypical facial pain
Remember that the CT paranasal sinuses may be normal unless the patient
is symptomatic and diagnosis may be difficult to make. Consultations with
neurology and oral surgery in a multidisciplinary setting for headache
treatment are useful.

CHRONIC SINUSITIS 1

Chronic sinusitis
Chronic sinusitis is an inflammation of the sinuses that lasts more than
6 weeks. Diagnosing chronic sinusitis, like diagnosing acute sinusitis, may
be difficult, as other causes of facial pain may mimic it.
Investigation for chronic sinusitis should include evaluation for systemic
disorders. Diseases that affect ciliary function (Kartagener’s syndrome),
mucus secretions (Cystic fibrosis), and the immune system (HIV and diabetes) should be considered, especially if there are disproportionate symptoms or unusual organisms. These conditions are especially important
because they may predispose to the potentially devastating complications
of sinusitis.

Signs and symptoms
-

Pressure in the face, which gets worse on bending over
Pain when flying, particularly when descending
A feeling of nasal obstruction—can be objective or subjective
Rhinitis—runny or blocked nose and sneezing
Anosmia or hyposmia
Postnasal drip
Cough (especially in pediatrics)
Halitosis (also common in pediatrics)

Investigations
- Nasal examination is performed to check the patency of the airway
and appearance of the nasal mucosa.
- Anterior rhinoscopy is used to examine the septum and nasal cavity.
- Nasal endoscopy is used to examine the middle meatus and look for
nasal polyps. Attention should be directed at potential blockages of the
sinus ostia. Anatomy such as nasal septal deviation, paradoxical curvature of the middle turbinate, lateralized uncinate process, hypertrophic
turbinates, and concho bullosa may contribute to chronic sinusitis and
are amenable to surgical treatment.
- CT scanning—a non-contrast CT scan of the paranasal sinuses may be
very valuable (Fig. 6.5). The purpose is not necessarily to make the
diagnosis of sinusitis but to examine the sinus outflow anatomy.

Treatment
Eighty percent of patients respond to medical therapy. This will involve
one or more of the following medication for at least 3 months:
- Intranasal steroid for inflammation and edema of the mucosa
- Oral antihistamine such as cetirizine hydrochloride
If medical treatment fails, the following treatments may be considered:
- Allergy testing
- Prolonged course of antibiotics for greater than 3 weeks’ duration.
The organisms are similar to those found in acute sinusitis but also
include more anaerobes, S. aureus, and H. influenza.
- Functional endoscopic sinus surgery—extent is dictated by disease
process at surgery
- Septoplasty may be necessary in addition to above.

125

126

CHAPTER 6

The nose and sinuses

Pediatric sinusitis
Development of sinuses
- Maxillary sinus is the first to develop in utero and is present at birth.
This is the most common site of sinusitis.
- Ethmoid sinuses are present at birth and expand to reach adult size by
age 15 years. Involvement of the ethmoid sinuses can lead to orbital,
cavernous sinus and CNS complications.
- Frontal sinuses do not appear until age 5–6 years and are frequently
hypoplastic in adults.
- Sphenoid sinuses form from evagination of nasal mucosa into the
sphenoid bone.

Signs and symptoms
The most common symptoms are nasal congestion, cough, and halitosis.
Purulent nasal drainage may be present as well as fever. Predisposing risk
factors in children include adenoid hypertrophy, extraesophageal reflux,
and asthma. Congenital immunoglobulin deficiencies and Cystic fibrosis
should be considered during workup.

Treatment
Treatment in children is similar to that in adults. The most common
pathogens are streptococcus, S. pneumonia, M catarrhalis, and H. influenza.
Surgery is generally not necessary.

Special considerations
Cystic fibrosis is an autosomal recessive disease that affects mucus
production. The genetic defect is well characterized and involves a mutation in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator. The mutation
alters the transportation of chlorine and water and affects exocrine
function. The result is formation of thick tenacious mucus that is difficult
to clear and creates a nidus for infection. Almost all patients with CF
have sinusitis. Approximately 10% also have nasal polyps. There are
associated problems with the bronchopulmonary system, pancreas, and
hepatobiliary systems. Diagnosis is made on the basis of a sweat chloride
test. Organisms frequently found causing sinusitis are Pseudomonas
aeruginosa, S. aureus, E. coli, and fungus.
Kartagener’s syndrome is a frequently tested but rarely seen congenital
disorder of ciliary function. The mutation results in deficiency in the
outer dynein arm and in primary ciliary dyskinesis. The clinical manifestations include recurrent sinusitis, otitis media, and male infertility.
The classic Kartagener’s triad is chronic sinusitis, bronchiectesis, and situs
inversus (the heart is on the right side of the chest). Diagnosis is made on
biopsy of the nasal mucosa with electron microscopic evaluation of the
cilia. Sinus drainage becomes gravity dependent.

CHAPTER 6

The nose and sinuses

Complications of sinusitis
Mucociliary damage
Long-standing or chronic sinusitis can lead to mucociliary failure.
This means that the sinus cannot drain properly, even if it is anatomically
ventilated. Cigarette smoke will also paralyze cilia action, so smoking
should be avoided by those with sinusitis. Patients develop chronic crusting and dryness and a sense of nasal congestion. Treatment is supportive
with aggressive nasal hydration.

Orbital complications
The proximity of the sinuses, especially the ethmoids, to the orbit can
result in concomitant infections. An unresolved episode of acute ethmoid
or pansinusitis may lead to orbital complications as shown in Fig. 6.6.
The pathways to spread are usually through a weakness in the lamina
papyracea or via the communication between the ethmoid veins to the
ophthalmic veins. Management of this problem is dealt with in the emergencies section in Chapter 20 (see p. 417). The Chandler classification of
orbital complications is shown in Fig. 6.6. The infections generally follow a
stepwise progression.
- Preseptal edema and cellulitis—inflammation is limited to the periorbital area. The orbital septum provides a barrier to spread of infection
directly into the orbit. There is chemosis and periorbital swelling and
fever but no vision changes.
- Postseptal edema and cellulitis—inflammation is posterior to the orbital
septum and effects the orbit. This causes proptosis, diplopia with limitation of the extraocular muscles, chemosis, and vision changes.
- Subperiosteal abscess—a collection of pus forms between the bone
and the periosteum. Requires surgical drainage. Signs include proptosis,
diplopia, and vision changes.
- Interconal abscess—orbital abscess within the soft tissues of the orbit.
Presents with proptosis, chemosis, diplopia, and blindness. Surgical
drainage is required.
- Cavernous sinus thrombosis. See below.

Cavernous sinus thrombosis
Infection of the perinasal skin, sinuses, and nasal cavity can spread retrograde into the cavernous sinus because of a lack of valves in the ophthalmic venous system. This can result in septic embolic-causing infections,
inflammation, and eventually thrombosis. The most common organism
here is S. aureus. Clinical manifestations include spiking fevers (a “picket
fence” pattern of fevers), diplopia, chemosis, and blindness. Treatment is
with broad-spectrum IV antibiotics and drainage of involved sinuses.
The role of anticoagulation and steroids is controversial.

Intracranial complications
Meningitis, epidural, subarachnoid, and brain abscesses can result from
infections of the sinuses. The posterior lamina of the frontal sinuses is
thin and is shared directly with the dura of the frontal lobe. The posterior lamina also has numerous perforations made by diplopiac veins that

COMPLICATIONS OF SINUSITIS 1

can expose the intracranial contents to infection. Spread of infection
from the frontal sinuses can cause problems as shown in Fig. 6.7. Similarly,
extension of infection from the ethmoids and sphenoid sinuses can cause
meningitis at the skull base.

Pott puffy tumor
Ongoing frontal sinusitis can lead to osteomyelitis of the frontal bone.
A soft, boggy swelling then appears on the skin of the forehead.
Treatment is surgical debridement and parenteral antibiotics. The disorder
was given this colorful name by Sir Percival Pott, an English surgeon in the
mid-1700s.

FUNGAL SINUSITIS 1

Fungal sinusitis
Fungal infections of the sinuses can manifest in different ways, from indolent chronic inflammation to rapidly fatal, invasive infections. Host immune
response is the primary predictor for infection, and any sinus complaints
in immunocompromised patients need to be taken seriously.

Fungal histology
Generally the identity of the fungal specimen is based on a culture or
smear collected from the sinuses. Gomori silver stain is specific for fungal
elements.
- Aspergillosis is septated and Y-shaped. Branches occur at 45* angles.
- Mucormycosis is non-septated with 90* branching hyphae.

Fungal ball (mycetoma)
This is a noninvasive form of fungal infection characterized by formation
of a fungal collection within the sinuses. A CT scan of the paranasal
sinuses shows a very discrete heterogeneous mass with multiple calcifications. Treatment is with surgical debridement.

Allergic fungal sinusitis
This is considered an immune response to colonized fungus rather than a
true infection. There is usually a history of atopy, and signs and symptoms
are similar to those of allergic rhinitis and chronic sinusitis. There is mucosal
thickening along with polyps. On biopsy, there are fungal elements
present with allergic mucin and nasal eosinophilia.

Chronic invasive fungal sinusitis
This is a more indolent form of fungal infection with invasion of the soft
tissues. The symptoms are suggestive of chronic sinusitis, but there may
be evidence of local invasion to adjacent structures. Biopsy shows invasive
fungal elements and treatment is surgical debridement with long-term
intravenous antifungals.

Invasive fungal sinusitis
This is considered an acute sinus emergency. Invasive fungal sinusitis is
usually caused by Aspergillosis or Mucor and occurs almost exclusively in
immunocompromised patients. Patients with HIV or diabetes and those
undergoing chemotherapy or bone marrow transplant are at highest risk.
Mortality is 50%. This condition causes soft tissue necrosis in the nasal
cavity, palate, and external nose. There may be little or no pain, as there is
a predilection for early neural and vascular invasion. Management is based
on early recognition and identification, with swift surgical debridement and
IV antifungals.

CHAPTER 6

The nose and sinuses

Nasal polyps
Simple nasal polyps are part of the spectrum of rhinosinusitis as the lining
of the nose becomes inflamed and thicker. These polyps are edematous
sinus mucosa, which prolapse to fill the nasal cavity to a variable extent.
They are common, and their cause is unknown.

Signs and symptoms
-

Variable symptoms—with the season or with URTI
Rhinitis—blocked or runny nose and sneezing
Sinusitis—due to osteomeatal obstruction
Nasal obstruction
Appearance of the polyps at the anterior nares
Proptosis when severe

Investigations
- Anterior rhinoscopy—inferior turbinates are often incorrectly
diagnosed as polyps; a rhinoscopy can help avoid this misdiagnosis
(see Fig. 6.8).
- Rigid nasal endoscopy
- CT scan to evaluate for sinus inflammation
- Polyp size can be graded (see Fig. 6.9).

Treatment
- For small nasal polyps treat with nasal steroids.
- For large nasal polyps treat with nasal steroids and consider oral
steroids.
If medical treatment fails, the following treatments should be considered:
- Surgical removal for obstructive polyps—if the patient is sufficiently
symptomatic
- FESS
- Postoperative intranasal steroids
- Recurrences are common.

Samter’s triad
This is the association of
- Aspirin sensitivity, making patients wheezy when they take aspirin
- Late-onset asthma
- Nasal polyps
It is caused by a defect in leukotriene metabolism. Polyps in this condition
are florid and recur frequently.
Treatment
- Diet—refer patient to a dietician for advice on a low-salicylate diet.
This is very bland and difficult to maintain.
- Intranasal steroids
- Repeat surgery as for nasal polyps above—the microdebrider is the
atraumatic instrument of choice.
- Leukotriene antagonists, e.g., Monteleukast, to reduce the
polyps—results may vary.

CHAPTER 6

The nose and sinuses

Unusual nasal polyps
Antrochoanal polyps
These polyps originate from the maxillary sinus and often present as a
unilateral pendulous mass in the nasopharynx (see Fig. 6.10). The uncinate
process directs the polyp posteriorly as it emerges from the maxillary
sinus. They are uncommon and their cause is not known.
Macroscopically, the polyp is formed from a nasal component similar in
appearance to a common nasal polyp.
The maxillary antral component is a thin, fluid-filled cyst. A small
fibrous band joins the two as it passes out of the sinus.
Treatment
- CT scan to confirm the diagnosis
- Endoscopic removal of the polyps from its point of attachment in the
maxillary sinus
- Caldwell–Luc approach for recurrent problem—an open sinus
operation accessing the sinus via a cut in the mouth under the top lip

Childhood polyps
Polyps presenting in childhood are very unusual. They are usually associated with an underlying mucociliary abnormality such as cystic fibrosis or
Kartagener’s syndrome.
Investigations
- Consider a chloride sweat test, the diagnostic test for cystic fibrosis.
- Send biopsy to check that it is not a tumor.
- Get a fresh sample of nasal lining for special tests of ciliary function.
- Get a sample for electron microscopy to check the cillary structure.
Treatments
- Medical treatment with steroids
- Surgical removal

CHAPTER 6

The nose and sinuses

Septal problems
The nasal septum provides an important mechanical support for the
external nasal skeleton, dividing the nasal cavity into two compartments.
Problems with the nasal septum can lead to both a cosmetic and functional disturbance of the nose. The nose may look bent to one side
and/or the nasal airway may be restricted.

Septal deviation
The causes of septal deviation can be either congenital or traumatic.
A traumatic septal deviation could be the result of a broken nose.
Congenital septal deviation can occur after birth trauma to the nose or
the differential growth of the nasal septum compared to the rest of the
skull.
Almost all nasal septae are deviated to some extent. Most people do
not experience any problem, but some find that their airway has
become restricted. Acoustic rhinomanometry and computer flow modeling
have shown that deviations at the area of the nasal valve cause the most
functional impairment to airflow.
The internal nasal valve is the area bordered by the septum anterior
edge of the inferior turbinate and caudal edge of the upper lateral cartilage. This area is situated about 1 cm posterior to the nares and is the
narrowest segment of the nasal airway.
The external nasal valve is the area of the nasal vestibule formed by
the nasal alar cartilage, columella, and nasal sill.
Change in the relative position of any of these structures causes a
change in the cross-sectional area of the nasal valve and will result in
nasal congestion.
Investigations
- Anterior rhinoscopy to exclude other problems, e.g., rhinitis
- Cottle’s test to exclude alar collapse
- Nasal endoscopy to exclude sinusitis
Treatment
- Three months’ trial of an intranasal steroid
- Surgery—septoplasty, or a submucous resection (SMR), is an operation
on the nasal septum to improve nasal breathing. Treatment of the
turbinates is common.

SEPTAL PERFORATION 1

Septal perforation
Septal perforation results in disruption of nasal airflow with increased
turbulence. Common reasons for septal perforation include the following:
- Trauma or accident
- Septal surgery
- Granulomatous disease—this must be excluded before treating perforation (see p. 138).
- Wegener’s granulomatosis
- Sarcoidosis
- TB
- Syphilis
- Cocaine use

Signs and symptoms
-

Chronic nasal congestion
Whistling—if there is a small anterior perforation
Epistaxis
Crusting of the nose at the site of the perforation

Treatment
-

Aggressive nasal hydration with nasal saline sprays
Apply petrolatum to the edge of the perforation.
Treat epistaxis expectantly.
Septal button—this is a silastic prosthesis fitted into the hole in the
septum. Only half of patients find it tolerable and continue using it
long term.
- Surgical septal repair—the results of surgery are variable even in
experienced hands.

137

138

CHAPTER 6

The nose and sinuses

Granulomatous conditions
These are an uncommon group of diseases that are classified together
because of their histological appearance—they all form granulomas. Signs
and symptoms are generally nasal congestion, bleeding, and the presence
of irregular granulation within the upper aerodigestive tract. Diagnosis is
based on biopsy and associated clinical features.

Signs and symptoms
- The patient may present with nasal granulomas as part of the generalized condition, e.g., sarcoid.
- Patients may have isolated nasal findings such as epistaxis, nasal congestion, septal perforation (posterior in syphilis), or crusting on the nasal
septum.

Investigations
-

CBC
Urinalysis
ESR
Syphilis serology
ANCA
Chest X-ray
Nasal biopsy

Wegener’s granulomatosis
Wegener’s granulomatosis is an autoimmune vasculitis affecting the small
vessels. The primary sites of involvement are the upper airway, lungs, and
kidneys.
- Key features are granulomatous inflammation of the nose, subglottis,
lungs, and glomerulonephritis.
- Septal perforation is a very common manifestation.
- Diagnosis is based on cytoplasmic antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody
(c-ANCA) pattern of immunofluorescence, biopsy, and urinalysis
showing red blood cells and casts.
- Renal disease may be rapidly progressive and potentially fatal.
- Treatment is with steroids and immunosuppresants.

Churg–Strauss syndrome
Churg–Strauss syndrome is a small-vessel vasculitis marked by peripheral
eosinophilia, granulomas, and allergic features.
- Key features are asthma, peripheral eosinophilia, sinusitis, pulmonary
infiltrates, neuropathy, and granulomatous inflammation of the nose.
- Diagnosis is based on soft tissue biopsy showing eosinophilic vasculitis.
- Treatment is with steroids and cyclophosphamide.

Sarcoidosis
Sarcoidosis is a systemic granulomatous inflammatory disease of unknown
etiology. The primary site is the lungs, although the patient may present
with nasal granulomas as part of the generalized condition.
- See Chapter 7.

GRANULOMATOUS CONDITIONS 1

Syphilis
Although rare today, syphilis was once the scourge of the developing
world. The manifestations of syphilis are varied and occur in a characteristic pattern. The spirochete Treponema pallidum is the infecting agent
and it is usually transmitted sexually. Its characteristics are as follows:
- The incubation period is 2–6 weeks.
- There is a primary lesion or painless ulcer (chancre) of the mucosal
membrane with lymphadenopathy.
- Secondary bacteremia with widespread mucocutaneous lesions and
lymphadenopathy can occur.
- The latent phase has few physical signs.
- The tertiary phase is marked by destructive mucocuteneous lesions.
On the nose, these gummas are painless granulomatous destruction of
the midline nose. Infection of the central nervous system, meninges,
and aorta may also occur.
- Septal perforation is often posterior in syphilis.
- Diagnosis is based on clinical suspicion and serum testing and biopsy
can help. Nontreponemal antigen testing such as VDRL and rapid
plasma reagin (RPR) are sensitive but not specific. Fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption (FTA-ABS) is more specific and sensitive.
- Treatment is with antibiotics; penicillin G is highly effective.

Rhinoscleroma
A granulomatous inflammation of the internal and external nose, rhinoscleroma is the result of an indolent infection by Klebsiella rhinoscleromatis.
The infection follows a specific pattern:
- A catarrhal stage with nonspecific rhinitis symptoms.
- A proliferative stage with formation of granulomas. Biopsy of granulomas show Mukulicz cells (foamy histiocytes containing the intracellular
bacteria). Nasal polyps, epistaxis, and septal perforation may result.
- A cicatricial stage with progressive mucosal fibrosis.
Treatment is with long-term antibiotics. Tetracycline and fluoroquinolones
are commonly used. The larynx and trachea may also be infected.

Rhinosporidiosis
Rhinosporidium seebri is a spore-forming fungus that can infect the nose
and conjunctiva. The infection is endemic to Africa, Pakistan, and India
and is spread with contaminated water.
- The granulomas form a friable, strawberry red, polypoid nasal lesion.
Biopsy shows fungal sporangia and submucosal cysts.
- The lesions are treated with excision and cautery and systemic
antifungal medications.

CHAPTER 6

The nose and sinuses

Sinonasal masses
Sinonasal malignancy is dealt with in Chapter 15.

Congenital nasal masses
Encephaloceles These are the reasons not to biopsy intranasal masses
without prior imaging. Encephaloceles result from failure to close embryologic spaces enclosing the anterior neuropore. This produces communication through the frontal or nasal bones that can result in meninges and
brain tissue herniating in the nasal cavity or external nose. Encephaloceles
communicate with the CNS. Biopsy may result in infection and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak. Encephaloceles can occur in other embryologic
fusion planes such as the occiput, sphenoid sinuses, and ethmoid sinuses.
Furstenburg’s sign is enlargement of the mass during valsalva or compression
of the jugular veins. Beware of any nasal mass that swells with straining or
crying.
Gliomas and nasal dermoids are like encephaloceles without the communication with the CNS. They are trapped, separated remnants of glial
tissue (gliomas) or dura (dermoids). They do not enlarge with straining.
They may have a remnant fibrous stalk attachment to the meninges.
Thornwaldt’s cyst and Rathke’s pouch cysts are remnants of the notochord that persist in the nasopharynx. They are smooth, midline, and
generally asymptomatic masses.

Inverting papilloma
An inverted papilloma is a mucosal neoplasm of the nasal cavity associated
with infection by human papilloma virus. The most common location is the
lateral nasal wall. The tissue proliferates and may cause localized symptoms with expansion and erosion of adjacent bony structures such as the
orbit, and may predispose to infection. The appearance is very similar to
that of nasal polyps but they occur unilaterally. There is a 10% risk of
malignant degeneration, and when incompletely resected they will recur.
Surgery with complete resection is the appropriate treatment. Classically,
this is performed in an en-bloc manner with medial maxillectomy via a
lateral rhinotomy or facial degloving approach. However, endoscopic sinus
surgery is now being performed for select lesions with good results.
Histologically this condition is characterized by an endophytic growth
pattern of the epithelium, forming the “inverted” papillary appearance.

ALLERGY AND IMMUNOTHERAPY 1

Allergy and immunotherapy
Allergy testing and treatment for upper-airway reactivity is a rapidly
expanding discipline of Otolaryngology. Although there are five major
types of hypersensitivity reactions, the majority of allergic rhinitis and
sinusitis cases are type 1, immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated reactions.

Type 1 hypersensitivity
Immunoglobulin E is produced by plasma cells during antigen reaction.
The IgE antibody binds to mast cells and basophils, which are the primary
cell mediators of allergic reactions. Mast cells degranulate when two
adjacent IgE proteins cross-link on the surface. The products of degranulation are histamine, proteases, leukotrienes, and prostaglandins.
- Acute phase: The reaction of the products of degranulation produces
inflammation of the mucosal tissues, resulting in nasal congestion and
rhinorrhea. This occurs within 5 minutes of exposure to the antigen.
- Late phase: The result of secondary factors that are activated by
leukotrienes and other products of the acute phase. These products
recruit other inflammatory cells and eosinophils and propagate the
inflammation.

Immunotherapy
The goal of immunotherapy is to desensitize the allergic response by
exposing the body to low levels of antigen. Although the precise mechanism of action is unclear, it is believed that this level of exposure alters
the balance between IgG and IgE.
- It is not first-line therapy, as the treatments are expensive and time
consuming, require a high degree of patient compliance, and are
potentially dangerous (can cause anaphylaxis).
- Indications include very severe symptoms, failure of medical therapy,
and unavoidable allergens.
- RAST test results and skin testing are used to select the allergens for
treatment.
- Dosing of the allergen depends on the level of sensitization. Highly
sensitive allergens are exposed at very low levels. The allergen is
injected intramuscularly or subcutaneously.
- The amount of allergen administered is gradually increased over time.
- Immunotherapy has the potential for allergy control and long-term
remission.

CHAPTER 7

The salivary glands

Structure and function of the
salivary glands
There are three pairs of major salivary glands—the parotid, the submandibular, and the sublingual. In addition, there are a several hundred minor
salivary glands scattered throughout the mucosa of the mouth and
throat. They produce saliva that aids digestion and lubricates the food
bolus.

The parotid gland
This gland lies on the side of the face, above the upper neck behind the
angle of the mandible and in front of the ear. The gland is pyramid
shaped and covered in thick fibrous tissue. The parotid duct, or Stenson’s
duct, opens into the mouth opposite the second upper molar tooth.
The external carotid artery, retromandibular vein, and lymph nodes all lie
within the parotid gland.
The facial nerve traverses the skull base and exits at the stylomastoid
foramen. It then passes through the parotid gland as the pes anserinus,
splitting into its five main divisions—temporal, zygomatic, buccal, mandibular, and cervical—as it does so. The facial nerve divides the parotid
into a deep and superficial lobe.
The parotid gland and submandibular gland together account for almost
90% of total salivary flow. The parotid produces a more serous (watery)
type of saliva and is highly activated during meals. The main cell type of the
secretory unit is serous.

The submandibular gland
This gland lies just below the jaw in front of the angle of the mandible.
The submandibular duct (Wharton’s duct) runs from the deep lobe and
ends as a papillae, at the front of the floor of the mouth (see Fig. 7.1).
The duct usually exits lateral to the frenulum behind the incisors.
The lingual nerve, which gives sensation to the anterior two-thirds of
the tongue, and the hypoglossal nerve, which provides the motor to
muscles of the tongue, lie in close apposition to the deep surface of the
gland.
The marginal mandibular branch of the facial nerve runs just deep to
the platysma (subplatysmal plane) close under the skin that overlies the
gland. Surgeons must be aware of these nerves to prevent iatrogenic
damage.
A number of lymph nodes also lie close to or within the submandibular
gland.
There are more mucinous glands within the submandibular gland than
the parotid gland. Histologically, the gland is composed of a mix of serous
and mucinous cells. The submandibular gland produces a mucinous saliva
and has a higher basal flow rate than that of the parotid.

The sublingual gland
This is the smallest of the major salivary glands. It is found, or felt, in the
floor of the mouth, running along the submandibular duct, into which it
opens via 10–15 tiny ducts.

STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION OF THE SALIVARY GLANDS 1

Parasympathetic nerve supply
See Fig. 7.2.
Parotid gland
The innervation signal originates from the inferior salivary nucleus of the
medulla and is carried by the glossopharyngeal nerve to the otic ganglion
via Jacobson’s nerve. The fibers join the auriculotemporal nerve, which is
a branch off of V3 to innervate the parotid gland.
Submandibular and sublingual gland
The innervation originates from the superior salivary nucleus within the
pons and travels with the facial nerve via the nervus intermedius to the
chorda tympani. The fibers join the lingual nerve off of V3 to innervate
the submandibular and sublingual glands.

Salivary gland function
The secretory unit of the salivary glands is composed of acini cells and
intercalated, striated, and excretory duct cells. Approximately 1.5 liters of
saliva are produced daily. Saliva functions to lubricate food and hydrate
mucosa, has immunoglobulins (IgA) with antibacterial properties, contains
enzymes such as amylase to break down carbohydrates, and protects
dental amalgam.

DISORDERS OF SALIVATION 1

Disorders of salivation
Xerostomia
Xerostomia can occur with any condition that reduces salivary flow, such
as radiation therapy, autoimmune processes such as Sjogren’s disease,
anticholinergic medications, and dehydration. Xerostomia seriously impacts
quality of life and can compromise nutrition, oral hygiene, and hydration.
The dryness can affect swallowing function and predispose to infection and
bleeding. Treatment is generally supportive with aggressive hydration,
pilocarpine, artificial saliva, and rigorous dental care.

Sialorrhea and ptyalism
Sialorrhea is excessive salivary production and is relatively rare compared
to ptyalism, or loss of control of saliva with drooling. Hypersecretion of
saliva can occur with certain medications and with infections of the gums
and mouth. Drooling can occur in any condition that affects oral, facial, or
laryngeal function. Common disorders causing ptyalism include Parkinsonism, stroke, oral incompetence, facial palsy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,
and cerebral palsy. Constant drooling can result in problems with skin
irritation or breakdown, oral infections, dental caries, electrolyte loss, and
dehydration.
Treatment of ptyalism is geared toward the needs of the patient.
Swallowing therapy can help with management of saliva and bolus preparation as can positioning of the head and neck during meals. Medications
with anticholinergic effects are also effective but have systemic side effects.
Scopalamine and glycopyrrolate are the most common agents. Surgical
management includes removal of the submandibular glands, ligation or
rerouting of the ducts, transection of Jacobson’s nerve over the promontory
of the tympanic plexus, and radiation therapy. Botulinum toxin injections
into the glands are also used to temporarily chemodenervate the major
salivary glands.

CHAPTER 7

The salivary glands

Salivary gland tumors
-

80% of all salivary gland tumors occur in the parotid gland.
80% of these are benign pleomorphic or mixed adenomas.
50% of submandibular gland tumors are malignant.
80% of minor salivary gland tumors are malignant.

Benign tumors
Pleomorphic adenomas or benign mixed tumor
Parotid pleomorphic adenomas are the most common salivary tumor.
They are benign but have the potential for malignant transformation.
They appear most often as an asymptomatic firm, mobile lump behind
the angle of the mandible—this may displace the earlobe upward slightly.
The tail of the parotid within the superficial lobe is the most common
site. Weakness of the facial nerve suggests a malignant infiltration and the
diagnosis must be questioned. Deep lobe parotid tumors can displace the
oropharynx medially and may cause the tonsils to appear asymmetric.
Deep lobe involvement occurs in approximately 10% of tumors.
Diagnosis is usually made via fine needle aspiration, and treatment is
surgical. To prevent recurrence of adenomas, the surgeon should remove
a cuff of normal parotid tissue around the lump and ensure that no tumor
is spilt during excision. Commonly, this involves a superficial parotidectomy.
The surgeon must take great care to identify and preserve the facial nerve
during parotid surgery. Recurrent pleomorphic adenomas can present as
multinodular masses that can recur within the wound bed or skin incision.
- Rare malignant transformation may occur to form carcinoma
ex-pleomorphic adenoma.
- Even more rare is metastasizing mixed tumor, diagnosed by the presence
of metastasis with benign histology.
Warthins tumor or papillary cystadenoma lymphomatosum
Warthin’s tumor is the next most common benign tumor of the salivary
glands. It most commonly affects elderly men. It occurs most often in the
parotid gland, often in its tail—the part of the parotid that extends into
the neck. This is the only tumor recognized as occurring bilaterally (occurs
in 10%), and its cause is unknown. Unlike pleomorphic adenomas, which
are firm, Warthin’s tumors are usually soft, cystic, and compressible.
Malignant transformation is rare. Fine-needle aspiration often reveals a
cystic, fluid-filled mass with oncocytes (mitochondrial-rich cells) and
lymphocytes. Technitium 99 scanning, which is concentrated by the
mitochondria, can assist in the diagnosis. Treatment is surgical.
Oncocytomas
Oncocytomas are benign salivary gland tumors that are composed of
exclusively of oncocytes. Oncocytes are present in numerous glandular
tissues such as salivary glands and thyroid gland. Like Warthin’s tumors,
these tumors accumulate Technitium 99 which can aid in diagnosis.
Treament is surgery.

SALIVARY GLAND TUMORS 1

Other benign salivary gland neoplasms
- Monomorphic adenoma
- Lipoma
- Cysts
- Hemangiomas

Pediatric salivary gland masses
Hemangiomas and pleomorphic adenomas are the most common benign
salivary gland neoplasms occurring in children.
Hemangiomas
Hemangiomas are benign tumors of endothelial cell origin and represent
one of the most common benign neoplasms in children. Although not
made of salivary tissue, they represent almost 90% of all salivary gland
tumors in children less than 1 year of age. They affect primarily the parotid
gland and present as soft, compressible, painless, reddish masses. They go
through a characteristic natural history marked by an early, rapidly proliferating growth phase followed by slow regression with soft-tissue
fibrosis. Because spontaneous regression is the norm, treatment usually is
supportive; however, surgery is considered for functional or cosmetic
compromise.

Malignant tumors
Malignant salivary gland tumors are much less common than benign ones,
but the symptoms can be similar—usually a lump in the neck. The following
symptoms may suggest a malignant tumor:
- Pain
- Facial or other nerve weakness
- Skin involvement such as ulceration or fixation of the overlying skin
- Blood-stained discharge into the mouth
- Local lymph node enlargement suggests metastasis.
There are minor salivary glands in the mucosa of the nose, mouth, and
throat. Neoplastic transformation here is often malignant.
Mucoepidermoid carcinomas
These are unusual tumors in that they have a range of aggressiveness
from low to high. High-grade tumors require excision and postoperative
radiotherapy, whereas low-grade tumors are generally treated with
surgery alone.
- This is the most common salivary gland malignancy.
- The tumors are histologically composed of mucinous and epidermoid
components.
- They are associated with radiation exposure.
- Differentiation between low-grade and high-grade lesions is based on
percentage of mucinous elements. Low-grade lesions have a higher
percentage of mucinous component.
Adenoid cystic carcinoma
These are the second most common malignant salivary gland tumors.
They are slow growing and have a strong tendency to spread along the
nerves. This perineural infiltration occurs early and is one reason for the

149

150

CHAPTER 7

The salivary glands

poor long-term control rate of this disease. They can spread several
centimeters beyond the palpable lump in this way. Treatment is with
wide local excision of the tumor and postoperative radiotherapy.
The short-term or 5-year prognosis tends to be good, and patients with
a recurrent tumor and even lung metastases may live for years. But the
long-term or 25-year prognosis is poor, and in most cases patients will
eventually die of this disease.
- It is the most common submandibular malignancy.
- Facial or other nerve weakness occurs early.
- Histologically it has a classical “Swiss cheese” appearance with a cribriform. High-grade lesions are composed of more solid sheets of cells.
Other salivary gland malignancies
- Acinic cell carcinoma
- Malignant mixed tumors
- Carcinoma ex-pleomorphic adenoma
- Metastasizing mixed tumor
- Carcinosarcoma
- Squamous cell carcinoma
- Lymphoma
- Adenocarcinoma
- Clear cell carcinoma
- Malignant oncocytoma
- Salivary duct carcinoma
- Undifferentiated carcinoma

CHAPTER 7

The salivary glands

Sialadenitis
Sialadenitis describes any inflammation of the salivary glands. Acute sialoadenitis is commonly the result of an acute infection of the submandibular
or parotid gland. Suppurative sialoadenitis usually occurs in elderly or
debilitated patients, who may be dehydrated and have poor oral hygiene.
The most common organism of suppurative sialoadenitis is Staphylococcus
aureus. The presence of calculi, or stones, within the gland may increase
the risk of infection. Drugs such as the oral contraceptive pill, thiouracil,
alcohol, and many others with anticholinergic activity may cause sialadenitis.
Viral sialoadenitis is also very common, and mumps parotitis is one of the
most common forms.
Chronic sialoadenitis may be the result of multiple infections with
compromise of the outflow system, resulting in decreased flow and
mucous plugs. There is fibrosis of the gland as well as histologic evidence
of prolonged inflammation. Other common causes of chronic sialadenitis
include radiation, trauma, and immunocompromised conditions.

Signs and symptoms
The symptoms are usually a painful swelling of the gland and pyrexia.
They may be associated with meals. Bacterial sialoadenitis is generally
unilateral whereas viral sialoadenitis is traditionally bilateral. Pressure
over the affected gland may lead to pus leaking from the duct. There may
be a palpable stone in the duct or within the gland.

Treatment
Treatment involves rehydration, antibiotics, and attention to oral hygiene.
Sialogogues, such as lemon drops that stimulate saliva production, are
helpful. Surgical drainage may be required if an abscess complicates this
infection.
Chronic salivary gland inflammation or recurrent acute attacks of
sialadenitis may arise as a result of stones or stricture within the gland or
duct. Stones arise as accumulations of calcium and other salts found in
saliva, deposits on foreign material, and food debris within the ducts.
Strictures most often occur after an episode of inflammation in the duct.
Pain and swelling when eating are common. This condition usually occurs
in the submandibular gland, and surgical excision may be required.

SIALOLITHIASIS 1

Sialolithiasis
Sialolithiasis, or salivary stones, is common and usually affects the
submandibular gland, since the secretions are richer in minerals such as
calcium and phosphate and thicker because of increased mucin content.
The stones are usually composed of hydroxyapatite. About 80%–90%
of calculi occur in the submandibular gland, with the remainder occurring
in the parotid. There are very few cases of salivary gland stones in the
sublingual or minor salivary glands. The stones may cause salivary stasis
and obstruction. Risk factors include male gender, prolonged dehydration,
gout, diabetes, and hypertension.

Signs and symptoms
Symptoms may include pain and swelling in the affected gland during or
after meals. The gland will become tense and tender. Inspection of the
floor of the mouth may reveal the thickened, inflamed submandibular
duct, and a stone maybe palpable within the duct. If there is any uncertainty about the diagnosis, a plain X-ray or a sialogram (an X-ray of the
duct system using dye) should be used. A non-contrast CT scan can also
detect stones and defines its relationship to the gland. Submandibular
gland stones are generally radio-opaque and visible on radiographs.
Most parotid gland stones are radiolucent.

Treatment
Conservative treatment with rehydration, analgesia, and sialogogues may
be all that is required. Sometimes a small stone will spontaneously pass
out of the duct into the mouth and the symptoms will settle. Larger
stones may need to be removed. This can be performed transorally if the
stone is palpable in the floor of mouth and near the duct orifice. If the
stone is close to the gland, the whole gland may need to be removed by
an open operation via the neck. Endoscopic evaluation and removal of
calculi have also been described, and lithotripsy for stones has been used.

153

154

CHAPTER 7

The salivary glands

Other inflammatory conditions
Sjogren syndrome
Sjogren syndrome is an autoimmune disease that afflicts primarily women
in their 60’s. It causes dry mouth (xerostomia), dry eyes (keratoconjunctivitis sicca), and, in many cases, diffuse, non-tender enlargement of the
parotid gland. It may occur in a primary form or be associated with other
autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis or systemic lupus
erythematosus.
There are often circulating antibodies, called autoantibodies SS-A and
SS-B, that may be detected in the serum. The diagnosis can be confirmed
by biopsy of a minor saliva gland found in the mucosa of the oral cavity,
generally the lower lip. Pathology reveals an infiltration of plasma cells
around the gland.
Treatment is based on levels of symptoms and is supportive. Systemic
steroids may be necessary during acute flares. Steroid eye drops are
useful temporarily for severe symptoms. Dry mouth is generally treated
with good hydration, artificial saliva, and oral gel. Complications over
time include dental caries, difficulty swallowing, and mucosal discomfort.
Patients with primary Sjogren syndrome should be followed for the
development of lymphoma, which occurs in approximately 10%.

Other causes of salivary gland swelling
Benign lymphoepithelial lesions are associated with HIV infection and are
very commonly seen in the parotid gland. Symptoms include a soft, compressible, cystic swelling of the gland which when aspirated yields clear,
straw-colored fluid. FNA of the cyst walls may show aciner atrophy and
infiltration of lymphocytes with epithelial cells. There is an association
with B-cell lymphoma.
Systemic viral infections such as mumps and HIV may cause inflammation
of the parotid or submandibular glands.
Necrotizing sialometaplasia is a benign, self-limiting inflammatory process
that primarily afflicts males. It appears as a painless ulceration of the hard
palate. Histologically, there is squamous metaplasia and pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia. The importance of this entity lies in the potential for misdiagnosis as a malignancy such as squamous cell carcinoma or
mucoepidermoid carcinoma.
Granulomatous conditions such as tuberculosis and sarcoidosis may affect
the saliva glands.
Sarcoidosis is the great mimicker that can present as salivary gland swelling.
This systemic granulomatous condition has a wide range of different manifestations and has primarily lung involvement with perihilar lymphadenopathy. Histology shows the presence of non-caseating granulomas. Heerfordt
syndrome is nonpulmonary sarcoidosis with the following symptoms: parotid
swelling, uveitis, facial palsy (secondary to granulomatous inflammation
around the facial nerve), sensorineural hearing loss, and fever.

OTHER INFLAMMATORY CONDITIONS 1

Inflammatory pseudotumor occurs as painless swelling and can affect
lymph nodes. This is a non-neoplastic reactive swelling of unknown etiology. Histologically it shows diffuse inflammatory cells with connective tissue.
This condition resolves spontaneously.

CHAPTER 7

The salivary glands

Pseudosalivary swellings
These swellings may mimic salivary gland enlargement, such as the
following:
- Intraglandular lymph nodes
- Hypertrophy of the masseter muscle—may mimic parotid enlargement
- Parapharyngeal space masses—may present as an intraoral mass in a
similar way to a deep lobe of parotid mass
- Lesions or cysts of the mandible or teeth—may look like a submandibular gland mass
- Winging of the mandible—may mimic parotid swelling

The salivary glands

Salivary gland surgery
See Figs. 7.3–7.5 showing incisions (Fig. 7.3), the facial nerve and its relation to the parotid (Fig. 7.4), and the submandibular gland and anatomy
(Fig. 7.5).
The facial nerve passes through the parotid gland and is at risk in
parotid surgery. Surgeons will often use the facial nerve monitor to help
them identify and avoid injury to the facial nerve.
Other surgical pointers to the position of the facial nerve are listed
below:
- The facial nerve exits from the stylomastoid foramen, which lies at the
root of tympanomastoid suture. This is palpable during parotid surgery.
- The facial nerve lies approximately 1 cm deep and 1 cm inferior to a
small V-shaped piece of cartilage of the tragus known as the tragal
pointer.
- The facial nerve bisects the angle made between the mastoid process
and the posterior belly of the digastric muscle.
- A retrograde approach may be found by finding a distal branch and
tracing the nerve proximally.
- The vertical segment of the facial nerve can be identified via
mastoidectomy.

Complications of parotid gland surgery
- Paresthesia or numbness of the ear lobe is common, because the
greater auricular nerve may need to be divided to gain access to the
parotid gland.
- Hematoma
- Salivary fistula—when saliva leaks out through the incision
- Temporary facial nerve weakness—occurs in about 10% of cases
- Permanent facial nerve weakness—occurs in less than 1% of cases
- Frey’s syndrome—sweating and redness of the skin overlying the
parotid gland when eating. It occurs when postsynaptic secretomotor
nerve fibers are severed during surgery and they re-grow abnormally,
innervating the sweat glands of the skin.

Complications of submandibular gland surgery
- Hematoma—the most common complication
- Weakness of the marginal mandibular nerve—this can usually be
avoided by making a low, horizontal incision 2 cm below the angle of
the mandible. The surgical dissection should be carried out deep to the
capsule of the gland, i.e., in a plane deep to the nerve.
- Lingual and hypoglossal nerve damage—these nerves lie close to the
deep surface of the gland and are potentially at risk during the
surgery.

CHAPTER 8

The larynx

Structure and function of the larynx
Structure
The larynx is a tube made up of a cartilaginous skeleton, intrinsic and
extrinsic muscles, and a mucosal lining. The cartilaginous skeleton, which
houses the vocal cords, is comprised of the thyroid, cricoid, and arytenoid
cartilages. Above, the larynx connects with the pharynx and oral cavity;
below, it connects with the trachea and major bronchi (Fig. 8.1). Behind
the larynx is the opening of the esophagus.
The larynx is suspended from the hyoid bone, which is significant in
that it is the only bone in the body that does not articulate with any
other bone. The cartilaginous skeleton of the larynx is composed of
three unpaired and three paired cartilages. The thyroid cartilage is the
largest of the unpaired cartilages and resembles a shield in shape. The
second unpaired cartilage is the cricoid cartilage, whose shape is often
described as a “signet ring.” The third unpaired cartilage is the epiglottis,
which is shaped like a leaf.
The three paired cartilages include the arytenoid, cuneiform, and corniculate cartilages. The arytenoids are shaped like pyramids, and because
they are a point of attachment for the vocal cords, allow the opening and
closing movement of the vocal cords necessary for respiration and voice.
The cuneiform and corniculate cartilages are very small and have no
clear-cut function. Food and drink are guided from the mouth to the
esophagus, while air passes via the trachea to the lungs. Food passes over
the back of the tongue and runs down two channels called the piriform
fossae. These lie slightly behind and to the side of the larynx. They join
behind the cricoid cartilage and form the esophagus (see Fig. 8.2).

Function
The larynx has three primary functions: phonation, respiration, and deglutition. These functions are all intimately related to one another in as
much as dysfunction of one affects the other two. For example, during
deglutition the larynx protects the lower airways from contamination by
fluids, liquids, and saliva. The sequence is as follows: the larynx rises
during swallowing, bringing the laryngeal inlet closer to the tongue base
and allowing the food bolus to pass on either side. The epiglottis folds
down to cover the larynx. The vocal cords and false cords (see Fig. 8.3)
come together.

CHAPTER 8

The larynx

The vocal cords
Structure
The vocal cords, also called the vocal folds, are fixed to the thyroid
cartilage at the front and to the arytenoid cartilages at the back. These
cartilages can slide away from and toward each other, opening and closing
the laryngeal inlet. They divide the larynx in two—the supraglottis lies
above the vocal cords while the subglottis lies below.
The mucosal cover of most of the upper airway is respiratory epithelium
with numerous mucosal glands. The free edge of the vocal cords is
adapted for periodic vibration and is made up of nonkeratinizing
squamous mucosa with no mucus glands. A highly specialized lamina
propria separates the epithelium from the underlying muscle. This lamina
propria contains three layers: superficial, intermediate, and deep. The deep
layer is the stiffest layer and is made up of the vocal ligament (part of the
conus elasticus). The intermediate layer has the most elastic fibers of the
three. The superficial layer is often referred to as Reinke’s space and has
the lowest concentration of both elastic and collagenous fibers, thus offering
the least impedance to vibration.
Innervation
The sensation of the supraglottis and glottis is carried by the internal
branch of the superior laryngeal nerve. The external branch carries
motor fibers to the cricothyroid muscle. This muscle is important in
adjusting the tension of the vocal cord. The vagus nerve gives rise to
the recurrent laryngeal nerve and this in turn carries sensation to the
subglottis and is motor to all the other muscles of the larynx. The left
recurrent laryngeal nerve has an unusually long course and loops down
into the chest, lying close to the hilum of the lung. It is prone to infiltration
by tumors of this region (see Fig. 8.8, p. 183).
Lymph drainage
The vocal cords are a watershed for lymphatic drainage. Above, the
supraglottis drains to the pre-epiglottic and upper deep cervical nodes,
while below, drainage is to the lower deep cervical and pretracheal
nodes. The cords have very poor lymph drainage, so tumors limited to
vocal cords have a low risk of lymphatic spread. Tumors of the lymphaticrich supra- or subglottis frequently present with lymph node metastases
and consequently will have a worse prognosis (see Fig. 8.4, p. 167).

Function
The vocal cords are the source of the sound vibration (phonation), which
is further refined with our mouth, tongue, lips, and teeth to produce
speech. As air passes up between the cords, the Bernoulli effect draws
the mucosa of the cords together. They meet for a fraction of a second
and then the pressure rises below the cords, blowing them apart again.
This vibration of the cords along with the distortion of the mucosa that
results from it is known as the mucosal wave. This is the basis for voice
production.

THE VOCAL CORDS 1

Deglutition is a complex process that relies on several sphincters in
the upper digestive tract and is typically divided into three phases. The
oral phase is volitional and begins with preparation of the food bolus. As
this bolus passes into the vallecula, the involuntary oropharyngeal phase
begins. As the food bolus passes through the upper esophageal sphincter
the final (esophageal phase) commences.

CHAPTER 8

The larynx

Congenital laryngeal lesions
Young children and infants are more prone to breathing difficulties
because their larynx differs from that of an adult in the following ways:
- The airway is smaller both relatively and absolutely.
- The laryngeal mucosa is less tightly bound down and as a result may
swell dramatically.
- The cartilaginous support for the airway is less rigid than in an adult.
This makes it more prone to collapse, especially during inspiration.

Laryngomalacia
Laryngomalacia is the most common cause of stridor in infancy. Furthermore, it is the most common congenital laryngeal anomaly. Males are
affected twice as often as females. Laryngomalacia arises from a continued
immaturity of the larynx.
Signs and symptoms
- These are often not present at birth. In fact, onset of symptoms
typically occurs days to weeks after birth (most commonly within
the first 2 weeks of life).
- Typical stridor associated with laryngomalacia is low in pitch, with a
fluttering quality secondary to the circumferential rimming of the
supraglottic airway and aryepiglottic folds.
- Symptoms are most prominent when the child is in the supine
position or when the child is agitated. More forceable inspiration
tends to result in a louder stridor quality due to greater prolapse
and thus greater obstruction.
Diagnosis
- Radiographic studies can suggest the diagnosis of laryngomalacia,
although the mainstay of diagnosis is flexible nasopharyngoscopy.
Treatment
- GERD is associated with and worsens this condition. Patients should
be placed on medications to control acid.
- More then 95% of laryngomalcia will resolve in 12–18 months without
any interventions.
- Surgical intervention is rare and includes aryepiglottoplasty.

Subglottic stenosis (SGS)
This abnormality can be congenital or acquired. The vast majority (95%)
of cases are acquired. The most common cause of acquired SGS (90%) is
endotracheal tube intubation. The most important risk factor for the
development of laryngotracheal stenosis (LTS) is the duration of intubation.
Other factors include size of the endotracheal tube, movement of the
endotracheal tube, traumatic intubation, number of re-intubations, and
presence of an infection while intubated. Gastro-esophageal reflux (GER)
has been proposed as a medical condition that may exacerbate the
pathogenesis of LTS, may cause restenosis after repair, and may be the
sole cause of stenosis in patients with no previous history of endotracheal
intubation or laryngotracheal trauma.

CONGENITAL LARYNGEAL LESIONS 1

The main sign of this condition is stridor at any age from birth to
2 years. Diagnosis is made by inspecting and measuring the diameter of
the subglottis under general anesthetic. The important things to document
during endoscopy are as follows:
(1) Outer diameter of the largest bronchoscope or endotracheal tube
that can be passed through the stenotic segment
(2) Location or subsites (glottis, subglottis, trachea) and length
of stenosis
(3) Other separate sites of stenosis
(4) Other airway anomalies in infants (clefts, webs, cricoarytenoid joint
fixation, neoplasms, etc.)
(5) Reflux changes
Mild cases may be treated conservatively, but more severe stenoses require
surgical intervention and laryngotracheal reconstruction. See Table 8.1
for grading of stenosis.

Laryngeal web
This condition occurs when the larynx fails to completely recanalize and
the airway is reduced. Fusion can be minimal, with little effect on the
airway; or complete fusion can occur which is incompatible with life.
The main signs of this condition are respiratory difficulties, stridor, and
a hoarse cry. Severe cases will require immediate surgical intervention
either via a tracheostomy (when an artificial breathing hole is made in the
neck below the cords to bypass the obstruction) or by endoscopic division
of the web.

Laryngeal cleft
This occurs when the posterior larynx fails to fuse. At its most severe it
will also extend down to involve the posterior wall of the trachea.
The main signs are respiratory problems associated with feeding, as
a result of aspiration into the trachea. Mild cases can be difficult to
diagnose. When there are symptoms, surgical repair may be needed.

Vocal cord palsy
The recurrent laryngeal nerves are long in children and adults, reaching
from the skull base down into the chest and back up again to the larynx.
Because of their length, they are prone to damage anywhere along
their course. Unilateral palsy will cause a weak, breathy cry and feeding
difficulties as a result of aspiration, and bilateral palsy will present as
marked stridor.

CHAPTER 8

The larynx

Infections of the larynx
Acute laryngitis
Inflammation of the larynx may occur in isolation or as part of a general
infective process affecting the whole of the respiratory tract. It is very
common, often presenting as a sore throat and loss of voice with a cold.
Signs and symptoms
- Hoarse voice
- Pain on speaking and swallowing
- Malaise
- Slight pyrexia
- Examination of the vocal cords will show them to be reddened and
swollen.
Treatment
Most patients with acute laryngitis either self-medicate or are treated in
the primary-care setting with supportive therapy such as voice rest,
simple analgesia, steam inhalations, and simple cough suppressants.
Voice rest is especially important for any professional voice user.
Patients should be advised of this and of the risk of hemorrhage into the
vocal cord, which can produce permanent adverse effects on the voice.

Chronic laryngitis
Chronic laryngitis is a common inflammation of the larynx caused by
many different factors. It often begins after an upper respiratory tract
infection (URTI). Smoking, vocal abuse, chronic lung disease, sinusitis,
postnasal drip, reflux, alcohol fumes, and environmental pollutants may
all conspire together to maintain the inflammation.
Signs and symptoms
- A hoarse voice
- A tickle in the throat or a feeling of mucus in the throat
- A patient who is constantly clearing their throat or coughing—this
causes still more inflammation of the cords and establishes a vicious
circle
- A laryngoscopy that reveals thickened, red, edematous vocal cords.
Patients should be referred for a laryngeal examination if their symptoms
fail to settle within 4 weeks. If any concern remains after this examination, a biopsy under general anesthetic should be performed to exclude
laryngeal malignancy.
Treatment
The agents causing the chronic laryngitis should be removed. The patient
may require the skills of a speech therapist. Patients will also respond
well to explanation and reassurance that they do not have a more
serious condition.

INFECTIONS OF THE LARYNX 1

Reinke’s edema
This is a specific form of chronic laryngitis found in smokers. The vocal
cords become extremely edematous and filled with a thin, jelly-like fluid.
The edema fails to resolve because of the poor lymph drainage of the
vocal cord. Smoking cessation and speech therapy are helpful in removing
the causes of this condition. In some cases microlaryngeal surgery is
required to incise the cord and aspirate the edema. It is important to
minimize damage to the free edge of the vocal cord when performing
this operation, as it can permanently affect the mucosal wave and, hence,
the voice.

Epiglottitis and supraglottitis
This is an inflammation of the epiglottis or supraglottic tissues that affects
children and adults. Epiglottitis is now uncommon in children (as a result
of the HIB vaccination). It is seen more often in adults, where it tends to
affect the whole of the supraglottic tissues (and is called supraglottitis).
The causative agent is usually H. influenzae.
Signs and symptoms
- Difficulty in swallowing, leading to drooling of saliva
- Change in the voice, described as a muffled or “hot potato” voice,
or change in the child’s cry
- Dramatic swelling of the supraglottic tissues
- Pools of saliva seen collected around the larynx on endoscopy
This condition should not be underestimated. It may start with features
similar to those of any other respiratory tract infection, but it can rapidly
progress to total airway obstruction within hours of onset. Consider this
diagnosis early on, and get expert help.
Management
- Admit the patient and keep them upright. Laying the patient flat could
obstruct their airway.
- Do not attempt to examine the mouth, as this may obstruct the
patient’s breathing.
- X-rays do not add much to the diagnosis and remove the patient from
immediate expert assistance should the patient need it.
- Early diagnosis is essential for reducing morbidity and mortality.
- Call for airway assistance—an otolaryngologist, trauma surgeon, or an
anesthesiologist.
Treatment
If epiglottitis or supraglottitis is suspected, stop further investigations.
Escort the patient calmly and quickly to an operating room where the
anesthesiologist and surgeon are standing by with the appropriate equipment (laryngoscope, ventilating bronchoscope, and tracheostomy set).
Where possible, intubate the patient and treat with the appropriate
antibiotics. However, oral intubation may be difficult and surgery may be
necessary to secure the airway.

CHAPTER 8

The larynx

Croup
This infection is common in children. It affects the whole of the upper
respiratory tract, hence the more descriptive name, acute laryngotracheobronchitis. It is usually viral in origin (parainfluenza most common),
but a secondary bacterical infection (staphylococci, pneumococci) is
sometimes seen. The speed of onset of croup is slower than in epiglottitis,
but it can be extremely serious and even life threatening. Classically, a
febrile URTI is followed by a “barky” croupy-like cough. On lateral neck
X-rays the classic “steeple” sign is often seen.
Signs and symptoms
- Mild preceeding upper respiratory tract infection
- Rising pyrexia
- Stridor
- Malaise.
- Supraglottis unaffected
Treatment
- Admission to the hospital may be necessary for treatment in a
croup tent.
- Intravenous antibiotics (for bacterial superinfection)
- ± racemic epinephrine and nebulizer treatments
- Humidified air and ventilator support if necessary
- Steroids

CHAPTER 8

The larynx

Cancer of the larynx
The vast majority of laryngeal cancers are squamous cell carcinomas.
Smoking is the risk factor for laryngeal cancer, although smoking and
drinking in combination puts the patient at even more risk. It is the most
common neck and head malignancy.
Since the entire upper aerodigestive tract has been exposed to the
same risk factor (i.e., tobacco and alcohol), there is a widespread field
change throughout this mucosa. These patients thus have an increased
risk of developing another cancer in the mouth, pharynx, larynx, or
esophagus. Five percent of patients with one head and neck cancer will
present with a second primary tumor elsewhere in the head or neck.
This second primary tumor may be entirely asymptomatic.

Signs and symptoms
The patient’s symptoms will depend on which site(s) within the larynx is
affected. A tumor on the vocal cord will cause a hoarse voice, and a
patient in this situation will usually present with symptoms early in the
course of disease. However, a tumor in the supraglottis may produce few
symptoms until much later and a patient may present with advanced
disease. All patients with a mass in the neck must be referred for an ENT
examination.
Signs of advanced laryngeal cancer are the following:
- Pain—often referred to the ear
- Voice change—the voice is muffled rather than hoarse, unless the
tumor also extends to the true vocal cords.
- Breathing difficulties and stridor
- Difficulty swallowing or inhaling
- Lymph node enlargement in the neck—this is often the only
presenting feature.

Investigations
Although a clinical diagnosis can often be made after examination of the
larynx, a biopsy is essential, because conditions such as laryngeal papillomas,
granulomas, and polyps may mimic laryngeal cancer. All patients should
also have an examination of the entire upper aerodigestive tract (panendoscopy) to check for a second primary tumor.
All patients must have at least a chest X-ray. A CT scan of the chest is
routine practice in many centers. CT/MRI scanning of the neck is also
mandatory, particularly when looking for thyroid cartilage erosion and
enlarged lymph nodes in the deep cervical chain.

Staging
TNM staging is applied to head and neck cancers in a similar way to that
for other sites.
- The T stage is determined by the anatomical site or sites affected.
- The N stage refers to the local nodal spread.
- The M stage is determined by the presence or absence of distant
metastases (see Boxes 8.1–8.3).

CHAPTER 8

The larynx

Treatment of laryngeal cancer
Premalignant lesions or carcinoma in situ can be treated surgically by
removing the entire lesion. Some clinicians advocate the use of a CO2
laser to accomplish this, but there are concerns about accuracy of review
of the pathology. Early-stage laryngeal cancer (T1 and T2) can be treated
with either radiation therapy or surgery alone. In this setting they offer
about the same 85%–95% cure rate. Surgery has a shorter treatment
period, and saves the option of radiation for reoccurrence, but may have
worse voice outcomes. The procedure of choice is usually a partial laryngectomy. Radiotherapy is given for 6–7 weeks; its use avoids surgical risks
(see Box 8.4, p. 177), but it does have complications, including mucositis,
odynophagia, laryngeal edema, xerostomia, esophageal stricture, laryngeal
fibrosis, radionecrosis, and hypothyroidism.
Current treatment of advanced laryngeal cancer is evolving. For
instance, new chemotherapeutic regimens are undergoing clinical trials.
Surgical techniques are changing to decrease the morbidity of total laryngectomy. For advanced-staged lesions, patients usually receive surgery
and radiation, most often with surgery before adjuvant radiation. For
most T3 and T4 lesions a total laryngectomy is required; some small T3
lesions can be treated with a partial laryngectomy. The adjuvant radiation
is started within 6 weeks of the surgery, and with once-daily protocols
lasts 6–7 weeks. Indications for postoperative radiation include T4 primary,
bone/cartilage invasion, extension into soft tissue of the neck, perineural
invasion, vascular invasion, multiple positive nodes, nodal extracapsular
extension, margins less than 5 mm, positive margins, carcinoma in situ at
margins, and subglottic extension of primary tumor.
Induction and concurrent chemotherapy with external-beam radiation
is increasingly being used for the treatment of advanced-stage laryngeal
cancer.
Each patient should be assessed individually, and treatment decisions
must be made in a multidisciplinary team setting, with the knowledge and
consent of the patient.

Surgery for laryngeal cancer
The decision of which type of surgery to perform depends largely on the
size and extent of the tumor. Surgery may be performed endoluminally—
with endoscopes from the inside—usually with the aid of a laser. Or the
radical excision of part of or the entire larynx may be needed. In general,
smaller tumors (T1 and T2) are more easily treated with endoscopic
laser surgery, and larger T3 and T4 tumors are treated with radical
excisional surgery (see Laryngectomy, p. 177).

TREATMENT OF LARYNGEAL CANCER 1

Box 8.4 Key learning points in radiotherapy for laryngeal
cancer
- Treatment intent maybe palliative or curative.
- Chemotherapy is only used as an addition to radiotherapy
(or surgical) treatment.
- Small tumors do very well.
- Radiotherapy is usually given for small tumors.
- Large tumors are usually treated with a laryngectomy.
- Postoperative radiotherapy is often given for advanced disease
with poor histology.

Laryngectomy
Several different types of partial laryngectomy have been described.
These are collectively known as “less than total” and are beyond the
scope of this book.
A total laryngectomy, first described at the beginning of the last century,
remains a reliable and effective treatment. During a total laryngectomy
the larynx is removed and the trachea is brought to the skin as an end
stoma in the neck. The pharynx is opened and repaired to reconstitute
the swallowing mechanism (see Fig. 8.5). A neck dissection is often
performed in combination with this procedure because patients with
advanced or recurrent laryngeal disease are at considerable risk of having
nodal metastases, which may be palpable or hidden.

CHAPTER 8

The larynx

Voice restoration after laryngectomy (see also p. 177)
Esophageal speech
In those who can achieve it, esophageal speech (see Fig. 8.6a) offers
near-normal verbal communication. The basic principle is that air is
swallowed into the stomach and then regurgitated into the pharynx. This
causes vibration of the pharyngoesophageal (PE) segment, similar to in a
belch. This can be modified with the lips and teeth into intelligible
speech.
The main problem is that not all patients can manage to achieve this
type of speech, and even if they do, only small amounts of air can be
swallowed. This means that the resultant speech can only be made up of
short phrases at best.
Tracheoesophageal puncture
In this procedure (see Fig. 8.6b), artificial communication is created
between the back wall of the trachea and the front wall of the pharynx/
esophagus. This is usually done at the time of the initial surgery (primary
puncture), but it can be performed any time thereafter (secondary
puncture).
A one-way valve is inserted into this tract, which allows the passage of
air from the trachea to the esophagus, vibrating the PE segment as above.
To activate the valve, the patient must occlude their stoma and try to
breathe out. This may be done with a finger or by using a second manually
operated valve that sits over the stoma as part of a heat and moisture
exchanger (HME). The HME also filters the inhaled air and prevents
excess water vapor from being lost from the respiratory tract—in effect,
this replaces some of the functions of the nose.
Artificial larynx (Servox)
Some patients cannot achieve either of the above forms of speech and
require an external vibrating source. The vibrating end of this device is
held firmly onto the patient’s neck, floor of their mouth, or cheek, causing
these tissues to vibrate. As a result, the air within the pharynx and oral
cavity vibrates and sound is produced. Although the voice produced
does sound rather unnatural, this is a simple and effective means of
communication (see Fig. 8.7).

CHAPTER 8

The larynx

Benign lesions of the larynx
These are laryngeal lesions that are not cancer. Signs of a benign lesion,
such as a hoarseness, can be indistinguishable from those of laryngeal
cancer. It is therefore imperative that any patient with a change in their
voice lasting more that 4 weeks be referred to an ENT surgeon to
exclude a laryngeal malignancy.

Vocal cord polyps
Vocal fold polyps are benign lesions of the middle membranous vocal
fold that arise as a result of vocal hemorrhage. They arise spontaneously
and suddenly and may be associated with previous laryngeal inflammation.
The point at the anterior third of the membranous vocal fold represents
the area of pronounced phonotrauma. This region is also known as the
“striking zone,” and is a region where polyps, nodules, varices, and sulcus
commonly form. The symptoms are usually a sudden onset of hoarseness
with vocal strain and sore throat.
The appearance of vocal cord polyps can vary widely. Polyps are
unilateral and are commonly associated with a reactive fibrous lesion on
the contralateral vocal cord. They can be hemorrhagic with evidence of
recent hematoma formation. They can be also be pedunculated and may
be difficult to see because they sometimes hang down on their stalk to sit
below the cords. Histologically, these lesions form within the subepithelial
basement membrane. Treatment is with microphonosurgery.

Vocal cord cysts
These lesions are mucus-filled masses within the vocal fold. They usually
arise spontaneously and their exact etiology is unknown. They may be
associated with previous laryngeal inflammation. The symptoms are a
hoarse voice and/or a sore throat.
The cysts are intracordal and can be within the lamina propria or the
vocalis muscle. Treatment is with microsurgical excision, taking care to
avoid iatrogenic damage to the free edge of the vocal cord and, hence,
the mucosal wave and voice.

Vocal cord granuloma
This lesion is usually unilateral and affects the posterior aspect of the
vocal cord. As a result, it can have quite a minimal effect on the voice.
Vocal cord granuloma arises as a result of inflammation of the arytenoid
cartilage (perichondritis). It is most often seen as a result of intubation
trauma or excessive coughing. The patient usually complains of pain in
the larynx. Reflux is a commonly associated feature.
The lesion may require a biopsy, as SCC can present with similar
features. Treatment may include surgical excision, speech therapy, and
treatment of acid reflux.

Vocal fold varices and ectasias
Varices and ectasias of the vocal folds are the result of microvascular
trauma within the superficial lamina propria. Most of these lesions are
located on the superior aspect of the middle membranous vocal fold

BENIGN LESIONS OF THE LARYNX 1

(striking zone). This condition is most prevalent in vocal abusers, specifically
female singers. Voice therapy is the primary modality of treatment. Surgical
intervention may be instituted in patients who cannot accept residual
vocal symptoms and limitations. One of the more commonly used techniques involves making use of epithelial cordotomies and removing the
vessels.

Singer’s nodules
These nodules, also known as screamers’ nodules, occur as a result of
prolonged voice abuse or misuse. They are common in children and
amateur actors and singers—they give a characteristic huskiness and
strain to the voice.
These nodules are always bilateral and occur at the junction of the
anterior third and posterior two-thirds of the vocal cords. Early or “soft”
nodules will resolve with speech therapy and good vocal habits, but
long-established “hard” nodules may require surgery.

Papillomas
These noncancerous growths are most commonly seen in children but may
also occur in adults. Papillomas arise as a result of human papilloma virus
(HPV). The route of transmission is thought to be through inhalation. There
may also be some defect in the host immune system, as some individuals
are affected and others are not. Spontaneuous resolution tends to occur in
children around puberty, but this is less common in adults.
In its most severe form, papilloma may result in significant airway
obstruction in the larynx, trachea, and major bronchi. If the patient’s
airway is obstructed, surgical debulking of the papilloma is required.
Removal of every last papilloma in not advised, since this will cause scarring
of the vocal cords and the papillomas often recur. A tracheostomy
should be avoided to prevent spread to the lower airway.
Malignant transformation may occur in adults, especially with subtypes
7 and 11. Systemic treatment with interferon is effective, but rebound
growth may be dramatic when it is stopped. Cidofovir and indole 3 carbinol
have been used with some success.

Muscle tension dysphonia
This is a common problem seen in general practice and ENT practice.
The symptom is a hoarse voice that tires easily and may vary in pitch.
Patients sometimes say their voice “cracks” or “gives out” and the quality
of the voice varies from day to day and moment to moment. Occasionally
the patient may present with aphonia.
These problems are caused by laryngeal muscular-tension abnormalities
and are associated with voice misuse, psychological stress, and psychiatric
disease.
Globus-type symptoms are frequent, including a feeling of a lump in
the throat, a feeling of mucus in the throat, and frequent throat clearing.
The treatment is reassurance and explanation, with speech therapy for
patients who do not respond well.

181

182

CHAPTER 8

The larynx

Vocal cord palsy
Palsy or paralysis of the vocal cords will mean that the patient may have
a weak, breathy voice rather than the harsh, hoarse voice of laryngeal
cancer. Patients will have a poor, ineffective cough and aspiration is
common. See Box 8.5, p. 183.
The recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) is a branch of the vagus nerve
and has a long course (see Fig. 8.8, p. 183). This makes it susceptible to
damage in a variety of sites (see Fig. 8.9, p. 184).
Investigation
Remember the rule of thirds below:
- 1/3 idiopathic
- 1/3 surgery
- 1/3 neoplasia
Where there is no history of recent surgery, consider the following:
- CT scan—skull base to aortic arch
- Ultrasound of thyroid
- Esophagoscopy
If these images are negative, then postviral neuropathy is the most likely
cause. The causes of vocal cord immobility (fixation rather than palsy)
include rheumatoid arthritis, laryngeal trauma, prolonged intubation, and
carcinoma affecting the cricoarytenoid joint. An endoscopy, together
with palpation of the joint, is necessary to confirm this abnormality.
Treatment
Where there is a small gap between the cords, speech therapy may be all
that is needed to strengthen the mobile cord and aid compensation.
When there is a larger gap, the paralyzed cord can be medialized, either
by an injection technique or via thyroplasty (see Fig. 8.10, and Fig. 8.11,
p. 184). Poor function of the cords may lead to aspiration and pulmonary
infections. Dietary modifications, tube feeding, and even a tracheostomy
may be required to protect the airway from aspiration.

Neurological laryngeal conditions
Spasmodic dysphonia (or laryngeal dystonia) is a voice disorder caused by
involuntary movements of one or more muscles of the larynx or voice
box. Spasmodic dysphonia causes the voice to break or to have a tight,
strained or strangled quality. There are three different types of spasmodic
dysphonia:
Adductor spasmodic dysphonia is the most common of these conditions
and is characterized by abnormal breaks when the vocal cords inappropriately close causing choppy or strained speech. Abductor spasmodic
dysphonia is characterized by inappropriate opening of the vocal cords
and breathy breaks on connected speech. The third type is mixed and
has features of both.
Currently the best treatment for reducing the symptoms of spasmodic
dysphonia is injections of very small amounts of botulinum toxin directly
into the affected muscles of the larynx. The injections generally improve
the voice for a period of 3–4 months, after which the voice symptoms

BENIGN LESIONS OF THE LARYNX 1

gradually return. Re-injections are necessary to maintain a good speaking
voice. Initial side effects that usually subside after a few days to a
few weeks may include a temporary weak, breathy voice or occasional
swallowing difficulties.

Box 8.5 Learning points—vocal cord palsy (see Fig. 8.9, p. 184)
- Unilateral vocal cord palsy leads to vocal cord lateralization and a
weak voice but a good airway. Over time, the paralyzed cord can
medialize or the contralateral cord overcompensates to produce
a good voice.
- Bilateral vocal cord palsy leads to vocal cord medialization and
airway problems but a good voice.

STRIDOR 1

Stridor
Stridor is usually a high-pitched noise caused by an obstructed airway. It
is most common in children, because of the anatomical differences
between the pediatric and the adult larynx (see p. 162).
The timing of the stridor in respiration tells you the site of the
obstruction or restriction:
- Laryngeal stridor = inspiratory
- Tracheal stridor = expiratory—a wheeze
- Subglottic stridor = biphasic—occurs when breathing in or out
A small reduction in the diameter of the airway leads to a dramatic
increase in airway resistance and, hence, the work of breathing
(Poiseuilles law: resistance =r4 ).

Causes of stridor
Congenital
- Laryngomalacia
- Vocal cord web
- Bilateral vocal cord palsy
- Subglottic stenosis
Acquired
- Trauma
- Foreign body
- Epiglottitis or supraglottitis
- Croup
- Carcinoma
- Airway compression, e.g., thyroid

Assessment
Stridor is an ominous sign. Even if the patient appears to be coping,
be sure that they are closely observed and that facilities to secure the
airway are readily at hand. Patients may suddenly decompensate with
devastating consequences.
- Take a rapid history.
- Measure O2 saturation.
- Take the patient’s temperature.
- Check respiratory rate.
In children, pyrexia, drooling, dysphagia, and a rapid progression of the
illness suggest epiglottitis. Take the patient to a place of safety such as a
resuscitation room or operating room and call for a senior ENT surgeon
and experienced anesthetist.
A similar history in adults suggests supraglottitis. This diagnosis can
usually be confirmed by careful nasolaryngoscopy.
Also see the section on emergency airway, below.

- Will admission and observation be sufficient for the time being, or do
you need to intervene to secure the airway?
- If intervention is required, do you need to do something now, or do
you have time to wait for help to arrive?

Assessment
Assessment should follow three stages: look, listen, and observe.
Look
- What is the patient’s color—is he or she blue?
- Are there any intercostal retractions or tracheal tug?
- What is the patient’s respiratory rate?
Listen
- Can the patient talk in sentences, phrases, words, or not at all?
- Do they have stridor? Is it inspiratory, expiratory, or mixed?
- What history can the patient give?
Observation
- Is the patient’s respiratory rate climbing?
- Is the patient feverish?
- What is the patient’s O2 saturation? Is it falling?

Interventions
Consider the following options:
- Give the patient oxygen via a face mask or nasal prongs.
- Broad-spectrum antibiotics, such as Augmentin (check that the patient
is not allergic)
- Racemic ephinephrine
- Systemic steroids
- Heliox—this is a mixture of helium and oxygen that is less dense than
air. It is easier to breathe, and it buys you time, during which you can
take steps to stabilize the airway.
Endotracheal intubation
This should be the first line of intervention where possible. If it proves
difficult or impossible, move on quickly.
Cricothyroidotomy
Any hollow tube can be inserted through the cricothyroid membrane
into the airway (see Fig. 8.12). The Bic pen is famous for having been
used in this way, but a wide-bore cannula, “mini-trac,” or transtracheal
ventilation needle is probably more appropriate. If you are unsure of
your landmarks, fill a syringe with a little saline and use a needle to probe
for the airway, with suction applied. A steady stream of bubbles will
appear when the airway is entered.

THE EMERGENCY AIRWAY 1

Tracheostomy
A surgical hole is made in the trachea below the cords. In an emergency,
a longitudinal incision is made in the midline of the neck and deepened to
the trachea, dividing the thyroid. Brisk bleeding is to be expected. The
blade is plunged into the airway and twisted sideways to hold the tracheal fenestration open. A cuffed tracheostomy or endotracheal (ET)
tube is inserted into the airway and the bleeding thyroid is dealt with
afterwards.

CHAPTER 8

The larynx

Tracheostomy care and tracheostomy
tubes
Tracheostomy operation
In an elective tracheostomy, the incision is usually placed horizontally.
The strap muscles are separated in the midline, and the thyroid isthmus is
carefully divided and oversewn. The trachea is opened at the third or
fourth tracheal ring, and a window of tracheal cartilage is removed.
A tracheostomy tube of the right size (three-quarters of the diameter of
the trachea) is inserted and the cuff is inflated.

Tracheostomy tubes
The choice of tubes may seem bewildering; the basic principles are
described below (see Figs. 8.13 and 8.14).
Tracheostomy tubes with inner cannula
The inner tube is slightly longer than the outer one, and crusting tends to
occur at the distal end and on the inner tube. The inner tube can easily
be removed, cleaned, and replaced without removing the outer tube.
Any patient who is likely to require a tracheostomy for more than 1 week
is probably best fitted with a tracheostomy tube with inner cannula.
Cuffed and non-cuffed tubes
The cuff is high volume and low pressure, thus preventing damage to
the tracheal wall. The cuff prevents fluid and saliva from leaking around
the tube and into the lungs. In addition, it makes an airtight seal between
the tube and the trachea, thus allowing positive-pressure ventilation.
Most tubes are cuffed, but when a tracheostomy is in place long term,
and no mechanical ventilation is needed, a cuffless tube should be used
to prevent damage to the trachea.
Metal tubes
Metal tubes are non-cuffed and are used only for patients with permanent
tracheostomies. They have the advantage of being inert and “speaking
valves” can be inserted.
Fenestrated tubes
Most tubes are non-fenestrated. The advantage of a fenestrated tube (one
with a hole in its side wall) is that air can pass through the fenestration,
through the vocal cords and enable the patient to talk. The disadvantage
is that they may have an increased incidence of granulation tissue and
subglottic stenosis.

Post-tracheostomy care
In the first few days after a tracheostomy operation, special care needs to
be taken. The patient should be nursed by staff familiar with tracheostomy care. The patient should be given a pad and pencil with which
to communicate.

TRACHEOSTOMY CARE AND TRACHEOSTOMY TUBES 1

Precautions
- The tube should be secured with tape and knotted at the side of the
neck until a tract is well established.
- The tape should be tied with the neck slightly flexed.
- The cuff should not be overinflated, to prevent ischemic damage to the
tracheal wall. Use a pressure gauge to check the cuff’s pressure.
- The patient must be given humidification for at least the first 48 hours
to reduce tracheal crusting.
- Regular suctioning of the airway to clear secretions may be needed.
- A spare tracheostomy tube and an introducer should be kept by the
patient’s bed in case of accidental displacement of the tube.
- Tracheal dilators should also be close by for the same reason.

CHAPTER 9

The esophagus

Introduction
The esophagus is a muscular tube connecting the pharynx to the
stomach. In adults it is 25 cm long. It starts at the level of C6, the cricoid
cartilage, and it ends at the gastroesophageal junction, or the diaphragm.
The cricopharyngeus muscle acts as an upper esophageal sphincter.

Congenital esophageal conditions
These rare conditions may account for some cases of infant death, feeding
problems, or failure to thrive. They are frequently associated with other
abnormalities of the larynx and/or the trachea. Complex surgery may be
required and treatment should be given in specialist pediatric centers
(see Fig. 9.1).

Esophageal foreign bodies

GLOBUS 1

Globus
Globus pharyngeus, syndrome, and hystericus are all terms that have
been used to describe a common symptom complex of a “feeling of a
sensation in the throat (FOSIT) with no obvious cause.” It is probably
caused by excess muscle tension in the pharyngeal musculature.

Features
-

Feeling of a lump in the throat
Mucus collection in the throat that is rarely cleared
Symptoms come and go.
Symptoms are usually in the midline.
The sensation is most noted when swallowing saliva rather than food
or drink.
Worse when stressed
Worse when tired
More common in women
Associated with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)

Pharyngeal malignancy may present with similar symptoms, so beware
especially of the following
- Unilateral globus
- Globus and otalgia
- Globus and a neck lump
- Persistent or progressive symptoms
Reassurance is usually all that is required to treat globus, but further
studies such as barium swallow or endoscopy may be required to
exclude malignant disease.

CHAPTER 9

The esophagus

Laryngopharyngeal reflux
Laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR) is a common condition associated with
gastroesophageal reflux (GERD). It is caused by changes in the larynx and
upper aerodigestive tract due to stomach acid reflux. It is often associated
with an incompetent lower esophageal sphincter or hiatus hernia.
Doctors and patients may not recognize that GERD, a stomach problem,
could be responsible for their throat symptoms.

Classical symptoms of GERD
-

Heartburn
Discomfort behind the sternum
Nausea
Waterbrash—bitter fluid regurgitation
Odynophagia—discomfort with hot or cold drinks

Laryngopharyngeal reflux symptoms
-

Mucus in the throat
Postnasal drip
A feeling of a lump in the throat
Hoarse voice
Sore throat on waking
Cough
Globus

Investigations
Patients with a history of reflux symptoms such as indigestion, heartburn,
and burping may be treated with a therapeutic trial of a proton pump
inhibitor (PPI) for 1 month.
If the symptoms recur or treatment fails completely, patients should be
referred for further investigation with an upper gastrointestinal (GI)
endoscopy, barium swallow, and 24-hour pH monitoring.

Conservative treatment
Patients should be advised on the following:
- Make dietary changes such as avoiding spicy food, carbonated drinks,
and alcohol.
- Avoid using common triggers that include caffeine, chocolates, and
peppermints.
- Try to lose weight if obesity is a problem.
- Avoid going to bed within 3 hours of eating.
- Stop smoking.
- Prop up the head of the bed on a couple of bricks or blocks or use a
sleeping wedge.

Medical treatment
- Antacids such as Gaviscon
- H2 antagonists such as ranitidine
- Proton pump inhibitors

Surgical treatment
Patients who are resistant to treatment may require anti-reflux surgery,
which can be performed laparoscopically.

NEUROLOGICAL CAUSES OF SWALLOWING PROBLEMS 1

Neurological causes of swallowing
problems
The mechanics of the upper aerodigestive tract are complex. Food, drink,
and saliva are directed toward the esophagus, via the pyriform sinus,
while air passes to the lower respiratory tract via the larynx.
The swallowing mechanism is a complex process involving both
sensory and motor functions. It is initiated voluntarily but progresses as a
dynamic reflex. A neurological condition that affects a patient’s motor or
sensory function may also cause problems with swallowing.

Common neurological causes of swallowing problems
-

CVA (stroke)
Bulbar palsy
Motor neuron disease
Multiple sclerosis
Tumors of the brainstem
Cranial nerve lesions, e.g., vagal neuroma
Systemic neurological conditions, e.g., myasthenia gravis

Investigations
Assessment will involve taking a detailed swallowing history and asking
the patient about any coughing or choking attacks indicating aspiration.
A general neurological examination and a specific cranial nerve examination should be done. A chest X-ray may show evidence of aspiration.
A video swallow gives detailed information about the function of the
esophagus (such as delay, pooling, poor coordination, spasm, cricopharyngeal hyperfunction, etc.). A barium swallow test may be of limited value
because it will only give static pictures.

Treatment
Wherever possible, the patient’s underlying condition should be treated,
but there will be times when the aims of treatment are to control the
symptoms. This could involve the following:
- Swallowing therapy as directed by a speech and language therapist
- Dietary modification, such as more thickened fluids
- Gastrostomy feeding tube.
- Cricopharyngeal myotomy—surgical division of the upper esophageal
sphincter muscle
- Vocal cord medialization procedures, when a vocal cord paralysis
causes aspiration
- Tracheostomy (see p. 187)
- Tracheal diversion or total laryngectomy (see p. 177)

195

196

CHAPTER 9

The esophagus

Post-cricoid web
This is a rare condition and its cause is unknown. An anterior web forms
in the lumen at the junction of the pharynx and esophagus, behind the
cricoid cartilage.
Patterson Brown–Kelly (UK) and Plumber–Vinson (USA) both describe
this condition—their names are frequently used in association with the
syndrome.
A post-cricoid web is linked with iron deficiency anemia, and it has the
potential to become malignant. Because of this chance of malignancy, an
endoscopy and biopsy are recommended. It may also cause dysphagia,
and can be seen on a barium swallow.
The web may be dilated and/or disrupted with the help of an endoscope.

ACHALASIA 1

Achalasia
The specific cause of achalasia is unknown. Patients with achalasia have
two problems of the esophagus. The first is that the lower two-thirds of
the esophagus does not propel food toward the stomach properly.
The second problem is dysfunction of the lower esophageal sphincter
(LES). The LES should relax in response to swallowing to allow food to
enter the stomach. In patients with achalasia, the LES fails to relax, creating
a barrier that prevents food and liquids from passing into the stomach.
One theory about achalasia is that the nerve cells responsible for relaxation
are destroyed by an unknown cause.

Signs and symptoms
- Progressive dysphagia
- Regurgitation
- Weight loss

Investigations
A barium swallow may suggest achalasia. An endoscopy is needed to
exclude an esophageal tumor, as this can produce similar X-ray appearance
and symptoms.

Treatment
Drug therapy Two classes of drugs, calcium channel blockers and nitrates.
Usually taken 30 minutes prior to meals, they cause relaxation of the
sphincter.
Balloon dilatation (pneumatic dilatation) Balloon dilatation mechanically
stretches the contracted LES. This procedure is effective for relieving
symptoms of achalasia in two-thirds of patients, although chest pain
persists in some people. Up to half of patients may require more than
one treatment for adequate relief.
Surgery (myotomy) Myotomy can be used to directly cut the muscle
fibers of the LES. The surgical technique used most often is called the
Heller myotomy. In the past, surgery was performed through an open
incision in the chest or abdomen, but it can now be performed through a
tiny incision using a thin, lighted tube (a laparoscope or a thoracoscope).
This new approach is less traumatic and shortens recovery time. Patients
who undergo myotomy are given general anesthesia and generally stay in
the hospital for 1–2 nights.
Botulinum toxin injection Botulinum toxin injection is a new treatment
for achalasia. The botulinum toxin temporarily paralyzes the LES,
preventing contraction and helping to relieve the obstruction. Botulinum
toxin injection may also be used as a diagnostic test in people with
suspected achalasia who have inconclusive test results.

197

198

CHAPTER 9

The esophagus

Zenker’s diverticulum
This is a type of hernia, or pulsion diverticulum, that affects the junction
of the pharynx and esophagus. Elderly males are most often affected.
Zenker’s diverticulum is believed to arise as a result of incoordination
of the swallowing mechanism, leading to an increased intraluminal pressure
above the closed upper esophageal sphincter. As a result of this pressure,
the pharyngeal mucosa herniates through an anatomical area of weakness,
known as Killian’s dehiscence, that lies between the two heads of the
inferior constrictor muscle (see Fig. 9.2).

Signs and symptoms
-

Dysphagia
Regurgitation of undigested food
Halitosis
Gurgling noises in the neck
A lump in the neck
Aspiration
Pneumonia

Investigations
A barium swallow will indicate the diagnosis. A rigid endoscopy must
follow to exclude the rare finding of a carcinoma within the pouch.
This is sometimes the result of long-term stasis of its contents.

Treatment
Treatment is only necessary if the patient is symptomatic. Endoscopic
stapling of the wall that divides the pouch from the esophagus is the
current treatment of choice. Excision, inversion, and suspension of the
pouch have been described.

CHAPTER 9

The esophagus

Esophageal tumors
Benign esophageal tumors are rare and arise from the local tissue
elements, e.g., leiomyoma, adenoma, lipoma.

Malignant esophageal tumors
The risk factors for a malignant esophageal tumor include smoking, a high
alcohol intake, achalasia, and anemia. Eighty percent of malignant tumors
occur in males over 60 years old. Primary carcinomas are the most
common. These carcinomas are squamous and adenocarcinoma.
Squamous cell carcinoma
Squamous cell carcinoma arises from this epithelial layer in an apparent
response to chronic toxic irritation. Alcohol, tobacco, and certain nitrogen
compounds have been identified as carcinogenic irritants.
Certain medical conditions predispose patients to the development of
esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. These include achalasia, lye strictures,
head and neck tumors, celiac disease, Plummer–Vinson syndrome, tylosis,
and prior exposure to radiation. Squamous cell carcinoma may arise in
the setting of achalasia, typically after a period of 20 or more years, and it
is believed to result from long-standing irritation by retained material.
Of patients with strictures caused by lye ingestion, 3% develop squamous
carcinomas after 20–40 years.
Adenocarcinoma
Most common in the mid- and distal esophagus, adenocarcinoma arises
from abnormal esophageal mucosa in a well-characterized sequence.
In reaction to chronic gastroesophageal reflux, metaplasia of the normal
stratified squamous epithelium of the distal esophagus occurs, resulting in
a specialized intestinal glandular epithelium containing goblet cells, called
Barrett epithelium. Further genetic alterations in this epithelium lead to
dysplasia, which may progress from low-grade to high-grade dysplasia
and, ultimately, to adenocarcinoma. Gastroesophageal reflux disease is
the most important factor in the development of Barrett epithelium.
Of patients with GERD, 10% develop Barrett epithelium. Of patients with
Barrett epithelium, 1% develop esophageal adenocarcinoma, a risk that is
30–40 times higher than in the population without Barrett epithelium.
Therefore, patients with Barrett epithelium are advised to undergo periodic
surveillance esophageal endoscopy with biopsy.

The signs and symptoms
- Weight loss
- Pain in the throat and/or epigastrium
- Progressive dysphagia

Investigations
- Barium swallow may show a narrowing or mucosal abnormality
suggesting a malignant tumor.
- Endoscopy and biopsy will confirm the diagnosis.
- CT scan of the chest and abdomen is used to assess the extramucosal
extent and metastatic spread.

ESOPHAGEAL TUMORS 1

Treatment
- The best chance of a cure is with surgical excision, where possible.
This may be given with preoperative chemotherapy and postoperative
radiotherapy.
- After the excision, the resulting esophageal defect will be reconstructed, with either a stomach pull-up, free jejunal grafting, or a
myocutaneous flap (see Fig. 9.3).
Where a cure is not possible, palliation may be achieved via
- Radiotherapy
- Laser debulking of the mass
- Endoscopic stenting
- PEG tube for long-term feeding

CHAPTER 9

The esophagus

Barrett’s esophagus
Barrett’s esophagus (BE) is a metaplastic disorder in which specialized
columnar epithelium replaces healthy squamous epithelium. Barrett metaplasia
is the most common cause or precursor of esophageal carcinoma. The rate
of esophageal adenocarcinoma is increasing in the Western world, and it
has a poor prognosis, mainly because individuals present with late-stage
disease. The exact causes of Barrett’s esophagus are not known, but it is
thought to be caused in part by the same factors that cause GERD.
Although people who do not have heartburn can have Barrett’s esophagus,
it is found about three to five times more often in people with this condition.
Barrett’s esophagus is uncommon in children. The average age at diagnosis
is 60, but it is usually difficult to determine when the problem started. It is
about twice as common in men as in women.

Diagnosis
Barrett’s esophagus can only be diagnosed by an upper GI endoscopy to
obtain biopsies of the esophagus. At present, it cannot be diagnosed on
the basis of symptoms, physical exam, or blood tests.

Treatment
- Behavior and diet changes
- Medications—PPI
- Surgery if reflux is uncontrolled by medications

Anatomy of the neck
Surface anatomy
Many of the important structures in the neck can be seen or felt on
examination. These are:
- The mastoid process (a)
- The clavicular heads (b)
- The sternocleidomastoid muscle (c)
- Trachea (d)
- Cricoid cartilage (e)
- Cricothyroid membrane (f)
- Thyroid prominence (g)
- Hyoid bone (h)
- Carotid bifurcation (i)
- Thyroid gland (j)
- Parotid gland (k)
- Submandibular gland (l)
- Jugulodigastric lymph node (m)
Use Fig. 10.1 to identify the above structures on yourself. It is particularly
important to quickly identify the cricothyroid membrane to be able to
perform an emergency cricothyroidotomy (see p. 205).

Triangles of the neck
The anterior and posterior triangles of the neck are often referred to in
clinical practice and are useful descriptive terms. These triangles may be
subdivided as shown in Fig. 10.2a, but the usefulness of the subdivisions is
questionable.

Deep anatomy
The neck is divided into anatomical compartments by strong fascial layers
(see Fig. 10.2b).
- The posterior compartment contains the skeletal muscles of the
cervical spine.
- The anterior compartment contains additional fascial envelopes that
have these important structures:
- The pretracheal fascia encloses the thyroid gland and binds it to the
trachea.
- The carotid sheath encloses the carotid, internal jugular, and vagus
nerve.
Between these fascial planes lie the parapharyngeal space and the retropharyngeal space. These spaces are clinically relevant because they may
become involved in and allow the spread of deep-seated infections or
malignancy.

CHAPTER 10

The neck

Lymph node levels
The classification of lymph node levels in the neck is commonly referred
to in clinical practice, and it is important to have an understanding of
them (see Fig. 10.3).
Most lymph drainage from the aerodigestive tract is through the deep
cervical chain, which runs along the internal jugular vein deep to the sternocleidomastoid muscle. It has been discovered that particular anatomical
sites drain reliably to particular groups of lymph nodes.
A nodal-level system has been devised to simplify the discussion of
lymph nodes and to ensure that we are all talking the same language.
Essentially, this is a naming system that gives a number or level to groups
of lymph nodes in a particular area. See Fig. 10.3, which is a diagram of
the lymph node levels in the neck.
This nodal-level system is of particular importance when considering
the lymphatic spread of head and neck cancers. The first group of nodes
that a cancer involves is called the first-echelon nodal level. For example,
the first-echelon nodes for tonsil cancer are level 3; from here other
nodal levels may be affected, usually levels 2 and 4.
Cancers in other sites may metastasize in different patterns, for example,
the first-echelon nodes from nasopharyngeal cancer tend to be level 5.
This concept and model have led to the development of selective neck
dissections, i.e., supraomohyoid neck dissections (see p. 217).

CHAPTER 10

The neck

Investigation of neck masses
Neck masses are common. All patients with a neck mass must have an
ENT examination to exclude a malignancy.
A full history should be taken, including duration, change in size, smoking
history, pain (including referred otalgia), and any concurrent illness.
A neck mass should be thoroughly examined and the following aspects
noted: site, size, shape, texture (smooth or lobulated), position (midline
or central), solid or cystic, single or multiple, tender, attached to deep
structures, movement on swallowing, movement on tongue protrusion,
pulsatile (see Fig. 2.14, p. 33).
In addition to the above, a full ENT examination should be given.

Investigations
Fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) is the single most important
diagnostic test. It is like a blood test but involves taking cells from the
mass rather than blood from a vein. There is no danger of seeding malignant cells if the appropriate method is used (see p. 227, How to perform
an FNA).
Blood tests Where the history suggests an inflammatory mass, consider
the following:
- Complete blood count (CBC)
- Sedimentation rate or C-reactive protein
- Paul–Bunnell, monospot, or infectious mononucleosis (IM) screen
- Toxoplasma
- HIV test
Biopsy may be needed if a diagnosis cannot be made. Wherever possible,
this should be excisional rather than incisional. All but the most trivial
neck masses should be biopsied under general anesthesia. If there is a
high suspicion of malignancy based on history and clinical finding, frozen
sections should be sent and the patient should also be consented for a
possible neck dissection.
Endoscopy Cancers of the silent sites of the head and neck may give little
or no symptoms themselves but may metastasize to the neck, presenting
as a neck mass. Examination of these sites is vital, usually under general
anesthetic, i.e., via panendoscopy, which looks at the entire upper
aerodigestive tract. The silent sites include the following:
- Nasopharynx
- Tongue base
- Tonsil
- Vallecula
- Pyriform fossa
- Post-cricoid region

INVESTIGATION OF NECK MASSES 1

Radiology
- Chest X-ray—for malignancy, TB, HIV.
- Ultrasound scan (USS)—for thyroid, salivary glands. This test may be
useful in children, as it is noninvasive and easy, and it can distinguish
between a solid or a cystic mass.
- Spiral CT—rapid acquisition is useful for mobile structures like the
larynx and for those patients who find lying flat difficult.
- MRI—provides excellent soft tissue definition but is degraded by
patient movement.

CHAPTER 10

The neck

Congenital neck remnants
Thyroglossal cysts and fistulae
The thyroid gland develops at the base of the tongue and descends
through the tissues of the neck to its final position overlying the trachea.
It leaves a tract that runs from the foramen cecum of the tongue to the
thyroid gland. This tract curves around the body of the hyoid bone.
Thyroglossal cysts and fistulae arise from congenital abnormalities of this
process. They are the most common mass found in the midline of the
neck. The mass is usually located at or below the level of the hyoid bone,
although a thyroglossal duct cyst (TGDC) can be located anywhere from
the foramen cecum to the level of the thyroid gland. They are common
in teenagers and in young adults.
Signs and symptoms
These may present as a midline swelling, a paramedian swelling, or a
discharging sinus. The cyst will rise on tongue protrusion because of their
attachment to the tongue base (see Figs. 10.4, and 11.1, p. 221).
Treatment
Before surgical excision of the lesion, ensure that there is a normal functioning thyroid gland in its usual position in the neck. Surgical excision,
known as Sistrunks operation, involves removing the lesion plus the tissue
block between the lesion and the hyoid, plus the mid-portion of the hyoid
bone and any associated tract passing to the foramen cecum of the
tongue. Very rarely, carcinoma can appear in the thyroglossal duct. It is
typically papillary adenocarcinoma.

Branchial system
The word branchial comes from the Greek “bragchia,” meaning gills.
A cyst refers to a mucosa- or epithelium-lined structure with no external
or visceral openings. A sinus refers to a tract with or without a cyst that
communicates to either the gut or skin. A fistula is a tract connecting the
gut to the skin. There are several types of branchial cysts or sinuses,
depending on their embryological origin.
Types
First branchial cleft cyst
First branchial cleft cysts are divided into type I and type II. Type I cysts
are located near the external auditory canal. Most commonly, they are
inferior and posterior to the tragus, but they may also be in the parotid
gland or at the angle of the mandible. They may be difficult to distinguish
from a solid parotid mass on clinical examination. Type II cysts are associated with the submandibular gland or found in the anterior triangle of
the neck.
Second branchial cleft cyst
The second branchial cleft accounts for 95% of branchial anomalies.
Most frequently, these cysts are identified along the anterior border of the
upper third of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, adjacent to the muscle.
However, these cysts may present anywhere along the course of a second

CONGENITAL NECK REMNANTS 1

branchial fistula, which proceeds from the skin of the lateral neck,
between the internal and external carotid arteries, and into the palatine
tonsil. Therefore, second branchial cleft cyst is in the differential diagnosis
of a parapharyngeal mass.
Third branchial cleft cyst
Third branchial cleft cysts are rare. A third branchial fistula extends from
the same skin location as a second branchial fistula (recall that the clefts
merge during development); however, a third branchial fistula courses
posterior to the carotid arteries and pierces the thyrohyoid membrane
to enter the larynx. Third branchial cleft cysts occur anywhere along that
course (e.g., inside the larynx), but are characteristically located deep to
the sternocleidomastoid muscle.
Fourth branchial cleft cyst
Fourth branchial cleft cysts are extremely rare. A fourth branchial fistula
arises from the lateral neck and parallels the course of the recurrent
laryngeal nerve (around the aorta on the left and around the subclavian
artery on the right), terminating in the pyriform sinus. Therefore, fourth
branchial cleft cysts arise in various locations, including the mediastinum.
Complications
These include squamous cell carcinoma arising in a branchial cleft cyst.
Treatment
Treatment is with surgical excision. These lesions do not regress and
frequently become infected.

Dermoid cysts
These cysts lie anywhere between the chin and the suprasternal notch.
They arise from defects in fusion of the midline and are an example of
“inclusion cysts.” They present as painless midline swellings and do not
move on swallowing or tongue protrusion (as in thyroglossal duct cysts).
Treatment is via surgical excision.

Hemangioma
A hemangioma is an abnormal proliferation of blood vessels that may
occur in any vascularized tissue. Hemangiomas are usually not present at
birth but are antedated by a pale, well-circumscribed flat area that may
contain some central telangiectasia. The actual hemangioma will appear
within the first month and will continue to increase in size for the next
3–8 months. A stable phase of relatively no growth then occurs over the
next 6–12 months, followed by slow involution of the tumor by ages
5–7 years. They can occur just about anywhere in the head and neck, but
are more common in the skin, parotid, lip, oral cavity, perinasal region,
and larynx or subglottis. The complications of these lesions are ulceration, infection, bleeding, compression syndromes (airway compromise),
thrombocytopenia, and even high-output cardiac failure.
Various modalities of therapy are used to treat hemangiomas.
They depend on a variety of factors including: the age of the patient, the
site and size of the lesion, and the hemodynamic flow of the hemangioma.
It is important to note that congenital lesions typically regress.

Treatment
- Observation
- Steroids
- Embolization, cryotherapy, sclerotherapy, antifibrinolytic agents
- Radiation therapy
- Laser photocoagulation
- Surgery with or without preoperative embolization
- Any combination of the above

Cystic hygroma
These are rare, benign lymphangiomas found in neonates and infants.
They insinuate themselves between the tissues of the neck and may
reach a massive size. They may cause compressive airway symptoms.
Treatment involves securing the airway where necessary, surgical
excision, which can be staged, or injection with sclerosant.

CHAPTER 10

The neck

Neck infections
Parapharyngeal abscess
This is a deep-seated infection of the parapharyngeal space (see p. 207). It
often results from a primary infection in the tonsil or is an extension
from a parapharyngeal abscess (or quinsy) (see p. 98). It is more
common in children than in adults.
Signs and symptoms
These include pyrexia, neck swelling deep to the sternocleidomastoid
muscle, and a patient who seems unwell. There may be trismus or a
reduced range of neck movements. The tonsil and the lateral pharyngeal wall
may be pushed medially. Airway compromise is a late and ominous sign.
If the diagnosis is in doubt, a CT scan will often distinguish between
lymphadenitis and an abscess.
Treatment
This will involve a high dose of IV broad-spectrum antibiotics (Unasyn), in
addition to surgical drainage.

Retropharyngeal abscess
This is an infection of the retropharyngeal space. It is much more common
in children and infants than in adults.
Signs and symptoms
These include an unwell patient with pyrexia, often with preceding URTI
or swallowing difficulty. There may be shortness of breath or stridor, or
torticollis, due to prevertebral muscle irritation.
Treatment
A high dose of IV broad-spectrum antibiotics (Unasyn) can be given.
Where necessary, the airway should be secured, and surgical incision and
drainage may be performed via the mouth.

Ludwig’s angina
This is a rare infection of the submandibular space; it usually occurs as a
result of dental infection. It is more common in adults than in children.
Signs and symptoms
These include pyrexia, drooling, trismus, and airway compromise due to
backward displacement of the tongue. There may be firm thickening of
the tissues of the floor of mouth, which is best appreciated on bimanual
palpation.
Treatment
High doses of IV broad-spectrum antibiotics (Unasyn) can be given.
Secure the airway (try a nasopharyngeal airway first, since this will often
suffice, but where necessary consider a tracheostomy). Surgical incision is
often unsatisfying since little pus may drain away.

LYMPH NODE ENLARGEMENT 1

Lymph node enlargement
- The majority of neck nodes in children are benign.
- The majority of neck nodes in adults are malignant.
- Neck nodes may be involved secondarily in an infection of any part of
the ENT systems.
See p. 206, Lymph nodes.

Nonneoplastic lymphadenopathy
Cervical
- Viral upper respiratory infection
- Infectious mononucleosis
- Rubella
- Cat scratch disease
- Streptococcal pharyngitis
- Acute bacterial lymphadenitis
- Toxoplasmosis
- Tuberculosis or atypical mycobacterial infection
- Acute leukemia
- Lymphoma
- Neuroblastoma
- Rhabdomyosarcoma
- Kawasaki disease
Submaxillary and submental
- Oral and dental infections
- Acute lymphadenitis
Occipital
- Pediculosis capitis
- Tinea capitis
- Secondary to local skin infection
- Rubella
- Roseola
Preauricular
- Local skin infection
- Chronic ophthalmic infection
- Cat scratch disease
The diagnosis in these cases will often be made following the appropriate
screening blood test and chest X-ray. FNAC and even excision biopsy
may be needed to exclude malignancy.

215

216

CHAPTER 10

The neck

Neoplastic lymphadenopathy
Lymphoma
This is a primary malignant tumor of the lymphatic tissues.
Signs and symptoms
These include multiple nodes of a rubbery consistency. The patient may or
may not experience night sweats, weight loss, axillary or groin nodes, and
lethargy.
Investigations
FNAC may produce suspicious findings; an excision biopsy is often
required to confirm the diagnosis and allow for subtyping. A chest X-ray
and/or a chest CT scan may be done, or, for staging, a CT scan of the
abdomen or pelvis. Bone marrow may be needed for staging.
Treatment
This may involve chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy. The patient may
need a lymphoma multidisciplinary team review.

Squamous cell carcinoma
This is a primary mucocutaneous malignancy that commonly spreads to
local lymph nodes. It can affect single or multiple nodes.
Signs and symptoms
The patient may have ENT-related symptoms such as a sore throat, a
hoarse voice, or otalgia. The nodes may have a firm or hard consistency.
The patient may have a history of smoking.
Investigations
These may include FNAC, an ENT examination to look for head and
neck primary carcinoma, a CT or MRI scan of the neck, a CT scan of the
chest and/or chest X-ray (to look for metastases), a whole body PET
scan, a liver USS (metastases), a panendoscopy, and biopsy.
Where no ENT primary is seen on examination, a rigorous search
should be done for a silent tumor. This will usually involve imaging as
above with ipsilateral tonsillectomy, biopsy of the tongue base, postnasal
space, and pyriform fossa at a minimum (see Silent areas of ENT,
p. 208).
Treatment
This depends on the stage, the size, and the site of the primary tumor
(see also Box 10.1). Options for treatment include the following:
- Radiotherapy involves 4–6 weeks of daily treatment with a total dose
of 50–60 Gy.
- Radical neck dissection involves removing the affected nodes as well as
all the other nodal groups and lymph-bearing structures on that side of
the neck. This includes the lymph nodes at levels 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, the
internal jugular vein (IJV), the sternomastoid muscle, and the spinal
accessory nerve.

NEOPLASTIC LYMPHADENOPATHY 1

- Modified radical neck dissection takes all the nodal levels (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
but preserves one or all of the IJV, the sternomastoid, and the accessory
nerve.
- Selective neck dissection Instead of all the nodal groups being removed,
those groups thought to be at most risk are selectively dissected and
removed. All other structures are preserved.

The neck

Neck hernias
Pharyngeal pouch
See p. 198.

Laryngocele
This is caused by expansion of the saccule of the larynx. The saccule is a
blind-ending sac arising from the anterior end of the laryngeal ventricle
(p. 164, Fig. 8.2). A laryngocele is an air-filled herniation of this structure.
This can expand, and either remains within the laryngeal framework
(internal laryngocele), or part of it may extend outside the larynx
(external laryngocele). It escapes through a point of weakness in the
thyrohyoid membrane.
There is a rare association with a laryngeal cancer of the saccule, and
all patients should have this area examined and biopsied.
There is little evidence to support the supposition that this condition is
more frequent in trumpet players and glass blowers.
Signs and symptoms
- Mass in the neck, which may vary in size
- Hoarseness
- A feeling of something in the throat (FOSIT)
- Swallowing difficulties
- Airway problems
If the laryngocele become infected and full of pus (laryngo-pyocele) then
they may rapidly increase in size and cause additional pain.

CHAPTER 11

The thyroid and parathyroid glands

Embryology and anatomy of
the thyroid
Thyroid problems are frequent topics in both undergraduate and postgraduate exams. It is thus well worth investing some time in understanding
the thyroid.

Embryology of the thyroid
The thyroid begins its development at the foramen cecum at the base of
the tongue. The foramen cecum lies at the junction of the anterior twothirds and the posterior third of the tongue in the midline (see Fig. 11.1).
The thyroid descends through the tissues of the neck and comes to
rest overlying the trachea. This descent leaves a tract behind it—this can
be the source of pathology in later life (see Box 11.1) (e.g., thyroglossal
cysts—see Chapter 10, p. 212).

Anatomy of the thyroid
The thyroid gland is surrounded by pretracheal fascia and is bound tightly
to the trachea and to the larynx. This means the gland moves upward
during swallowing. The recurrent laryngeal nerves (branches of the
vagus) lie very close to the posterior aspect of the thyroid lobes. These
nerves have ascended from the mediastinum in the tracheoesophageal
grooves and are at risk in thyroid operations. They may become involved
in thyroid malignancy; in cases of malignancy a patient will often present
with a weak and breathy hoarse voice.
The thyroid gland has a very rich blood supply—trauma or surgery to
the gland can lead to impressive hemorrhage into the neck.
The parathyroid glands, important in calcium metabolism, lie embedded on
the posterior aspect of the thyroid lobes.

CHAPTER 11

The thyroid and parathyroid glands

Thyroid enlargement (goiter)
Goiter simply means an enlargement of the thyroid gland. It is not in itself
a diagnosis. Both physiological and pathological conditions may cause a
goiter.

Simple goiter
This is a diffuse enlargement of the thyroid and may result from iodine
deficiency. Diffuse enlargement of the gland also occurs in Graves’ disease.

Multinodular goiter
This benign goiter is the most common thyroid problem. It is caused by
episodic periods of thyroid hypofunction and subsequent thyroidstimulating hormone (TSH) hypersecretion, which leads to hyperplasia of
the gland. This is followed by involution of the gland. Prolonged periods
of hyperplasia and involution are thought to be responsible for the nodular
enlargement of the gland found in a multinodular goiter.
A finding of a single nodular enlargement of the thyroid raises the
question of malignancy. This should be managed as described below (see
Fig. 11.2).
Treatment
A partial thyroidectomy may be necessary, but only in a patient with one
or all of the following signs:
- Pressure symptoms in the neck
- Dysphagia
- Airway compression
- Cosmetic deformity

Graves’ disease
This disease is an autoimmune condition in which antibodies are produced
that mimic the effect of TSH. A hyperthyroid state develops and there is
often a smooth goiter. There is an associated hypertrophy of the orbital
muscles causing exophthalmos. The Graves’ ophthalmopathy may be most
impressive (the actor Marty Feldman had this condition). See p. 226 for
eye signs in Graves’ disease.
Treatment
Treatment is hormonal manipulation with carbimazole. Surgery to correct
the proptosis may be achieved via a transnasal orbital decompression.
Here, the medial wall of the bony orbit is removed to allow the orbital
contents to herniate into the nasal cavity.

THYROID ENLARGEMENT (GOITER) 1

Hashimoto’s thyroiditis
This is an autoimmune condition characterized by the destruction of
thyroid cells by various cell- and antibody-mediated immune processes.
There can be a transient hyperthyroidism, but most patients present with
hypothyroidism. Many patients develop a goiter, but the gland can be
normal sized or atrophic. Hypothyroidism is usually insidious in onset, with
signs and symptoms slowly progressing over months to years. Thyroxine
replacements may be necessary. Patients with this condition have an
increased risk of developing a thyroid lymphoma.

CHAPTER 11

The thyroid and parathyroid glands

Thyroid neoplasia
Thyroid tumors may arise from either the follicular cells or the supporting
cells found in the normal gland. They are quite common, and each of these
tumors has its own particular characteristics (see Fig. 11.3). Papillary and
follicular adenocarcinomas are frequently referred to as differentiated
thyroid tumors.

Follicular cell neoplasms
- Papillary adenocarcinoma
- Follicular adenocarcinoma
- Anaplastic adenocarcinoma

Supporting cell neoplasms
- Medullary carcinoma

Papillary adenocarcinoma
This adenocarcinoma usually affects adults of age 40–50 years. There are
usually multiple tumors within the gland. Papillary carcinoma spreads via
the lymphatic system, hence 60% of presenting patients have involved
neck nodes.
If the disease is limited to the gland, 90% of patients will survive
10 years or more. If the disease has spread to involve the neck nodes,
60% of patients will survive 10 years or more.
Treatment involves a total thyroidectomy, plus a neck dissection where
there are involved nodes. A postoperative radioiodine scan should be
performed and if increased uptake is found, an ablatative dose is given.
After surgery, patients will need lifelong thyroid replacement at TSHsuppressing doses.

Follicular adenocarcinoma
This type usually affects adults of age 50–60 years. There is a well-defined
capsule enclosing the tumor, and it spreads via the bloodstream. Up to 30%
of patients will have distant metastases at presentation, thus prognosis is
poorer than that for papillary adenocarcinoma.
Treatment is as above for papillary adenocarcinoma.

Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma
This condition occurs in adults over 70 years of age, and is more common
in women. It involves rapid enlargement of the thyroid gland and pain.
The patient will have airway, voice, or swallowing problems due to direct
involvement of the trachea, larynx, or esophagus.
The prognosis is very poor, with 92% of patients with this condition
dying within 1 year, even with treatment.

Medullary carcinoma
This carcinoma arises from the parafollicular C cells (or calcitoninsecreting cells). The patient’s level of serum calcitonin is raised and their
serum calcium level remains normal. Neck metastases are present in up
to 30% of patients.

THYROID NEOPLASIA 1

Treatment involves a total thyroidectomy and radiotherapy.

Benign thyroid adenoma
These adenomas can be functioning or nonfunctioning.
Functioning adenomas
These adenomas produce thyroxine and will take up iodine and technetium. They appear bright, or “hot,” on isotope scanning. Symptoms of
thyrotoxicosis may develop. They are rarely malignant.
Although treatment is usually medical with thyroid-suppressing drugs, it
may be surgical via excision. Radiotherapy and ablation may be required.
Nonfunctioning adenomas
These adenomas do not take up iodine. They appear “cold” on isotope
scanning, with 10%–20% being malignant. Treatment is via surgical excision.

Blood tests
Thyroid function tests (TFTs)
T4 (thyroxine) and T3 (tri-iodo-thyronine) are both bound to plasma
proteins in the blood, but a proportion of both remains unbound and is
physiologically active. Bear this in mind when interpreting these results in
conditions where the free-to-bound ratio may be disturbed, e.g., in
nephrotic syndrome or pregnancy.
Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) controls the production of thyroid
hormones via a negative feedback mechanism. TSH is usually raised in
hypothyroidism and reduced in hyperthyroidism.
Thyroglobulin
This is the carrier protein for T4. Its levels can be measured directly in the
blood. It is most frequently used as a tumor marker for the differentiated
thyroid carcinomas.
Calcitonin
This is produced by the medullary C cells of the thyroid. Levels are
raised in medullary thyroid carcinomas.

THYROID INVESTIGATIONS 1

Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA)
This is a tumor marker of medullary carcinoma of the thyroid.
Thyroid autoantibodies
Specific thyroid autoantibodies can be identified in Graves’ disease and
Hashimoto’s thyroiditis.

Radioisotope scanning
Radiolabeled iodine (123I) or technetium (99Tc) is given to the patient
orally. Then radiology is used to assess its subsequent uptake into
metabolically active thyroid tissue. A thyroid nodule may take up the
marker—it will appear bright, or “hot,” or it will fail to accumulate the
marker and it will appear “cold.”
- 80% of thyroid nodules are “cold.”
- 10%–20% of “cold” nodules are malignant.
- “Hot” nodules are usually benign.
- Often does not obviate the need for fine needle aspiration cytology

Ultrasound scan (USS)
This is an excellent investigation for demonstrating the thyroid. It will
readily distinguish solid and cystic masses inside the thyroid. Often, a USS
will show that what appears clinically as a single nodule is in fact part of a
multinodular goiter.

MRI and CT scans
CT and MRI are not a routine component of the thyroid mass evaluation.
The use of iodine as intravenous contrast for CT scans will interfere with
radioactive iodine therapy and should be avoided if a well differentiated
thyroid malignancy is suspected.
These scans may be helpful in determining the extent of a retrosternal
swelling. A non-contrast CT scan of the neck and chest may confirm
airway distortion or compression from a large goiter. These scans may
also reveal nodal metastases.

Fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC)
This test can be used to differentiate solid from cystic masses and it may
help in diagnosing malignancy. A residual mass noted after cyst aspiration
should be tested again by FNA to exclude malignancy. Papillary carcinoma is diagnosed by the presence of nuclear grooves and intranuclear
inclusions (often described as “Orphan Annie eyes”). It is difficult to
distinguish between follicular adenoma and follicular carcinoma; the
difference lies in demonstrating capsular invasion, which is impossible to
show on cytological features alone. Formal histology is usually required
to confirm this diagnosis.

CHAPTER 11

The thyroid and parathyroid glands

Treatment of thyroid conditions
Management of a thyroid nodule
This is best shown diagrammatically; see the flow chart in Fig. 11.2,
p. 223.

Hormonal manipulation
Thyroxine Patients experiencing hypothyroid states and those who have
undergone thyroidectomy may need to take thyroxine for life. Doses of
thyroxine sufficient to suppress TSH production are given in welldifferentiated thyroid cancers to reduce tumor growth, since these tumors
are also TSH driven.
Carbimazole or propylthirouracil may be given in hyperthyroidism, since
these inhibit the formation of T3 and T4.
Radioactive ablation
Most well-differentiated thyroid tumors will trap iodine. This ability can
be put to therapeutic effect by administering radioactive iodine.
The patient is first rendered hypothyroid via thyroidectomy. The tumor
cells then become hungry for iodine and will avidly take up the radioactive
iodine to their own cytotoxic demise! Radioiodine therapy can also be
used to control a persistent hyperthyroid state.

Thyroid surgery
Thyroid surgery is generally safe and well tolerated by patients.
Hemithyroidectomy involves the removal of one thyroid lobe. It is indicated in benign thyroid conditions and as an excisional biopsy procedure
when malignancy is suspected but not confirmed.
Total thyroidectomy is indicated in thyroid malignancy. Because it
increases the risks to the recurrent laryngeal nerves and to the parathyroid glands, some surgeons will perform a near-total thyroidectomy, leaving a small amount of thyroid tissue behind in the area of the recurrent
laryngeal nerve.

RISKS AND COMPLICATIONS OF THYROID SURGERY 1

Risks and complications of thyroid
surgery
Discussed below are some of the most common and important risks of
thyroid surgery.

Vocal cord palsy
This is due to recurrent laryngeal nerve damage. Patients will present
with a weak and breathy voice. All patients should undergo a vocal cord
check preoperatively to document cord mobility before the procedure.

Bilateral vocal cord palsy
This will lead to medialization of the vocal cords, resulting in lifethreatening airway obstruction. Facilities for re-intubation and tracheostomy must be readily available.

Hematoma
Hematoma after thyroid surgery is another potentially serious complication
because the vascular nature of the thyroid can lead to a rapid accumulation
of blood in the neck, resulting in compression of the airway. For this reason,
all thyroidectomy patients should have stitch/clip removers at the bedside.
If a patient’s neck begins to swell rapidly after thyroid surgery, the wound
should be reopened (on the ward if necessary), the clot evacuated, and the
airway restored. Once the airway has been secured, the bleeding point can
be found and controlled.

Hypocalcemia
This should be anticipated whenever a total thyroidectomy has been
performed. Daily calcium levels should be checked and the patient should
be observed for the signs of hypocalcemia:
- Tingling in the hands and feet
- Perioral paraesthesia
- Muscle cramps
- Carpopedal spasm—muscle spasms affecting the hands and feet
- Chvosteck’s sign—facial spasm seen on tapping over the facial nerve in
the region of the parotid
- Tetany—generalized muscle spasm
As soon as hypocalcemia is suspected, give the patient IV calcium gluconate
and start oral replacement therapy.

229

230

CHAPTER 11

The thyroid and parathyroid glands

Parathyroid embryology and function
Embryology
In all vertebrate species, the parathyroid glands are derived from the
endoderm of the pharyngeal pouches. The superior parathyroid glands
are derived from the fourth pharyngeal pouch. During development, they
are intimately associated with the lateral lobes of the thyroid gland, to
which they become anchored, giving them a consistent location (usually
midway along the posterior thyroid borders, where the inferior thyroid
artery enters the gland or at its intersection with the recurrent laryngeal
nerve). The inferior parathyroid glands are derived from the third pharyngeal pouch. During development, they are intimately associated with
the thymus gland and have a more inconsistent location than the superior
parathyroid glands. They are usually found close to the inferior thyroid
poles, but may descend with the thymus into the thorax or may not
descend at all, remaining above the carotid bifurcation. Accessory or
supernumerary parathyroid glands are found in approximately 13% of
individuals at autopsy.

Function
The function of the parathyroid glands is to maintain the body’s calcium
level within a very narrow range. When blood calcium levels drop below
a certain point, calcium-sensing receptors in the parathyroid gland are
activated to release parathyroid hormone (PTH, also known as parathormone) into the blood.
PTH is a small protein that takes part in the control of calcium and
phosphorus homeostasis, as well as bone physiology. Parathyroid hormone has effects antagonistic to those of calcitonin. It increases blood
calcium levels by stimulating osteoclasts to break down bone and release
calcium. It also increases gastrointestinal calcium absorption by activating
vitamin D, and promotes calcium uptake by the kidneys.

HYPERPARATHYROIDISM 1

Hyperparathyroidism
There are three classic types of hyperparathyroidism—primary, secondary,
and tertiary.

Primary hyperthyroidism
Primary hyperthyroidism accounts for most instances of hyperparathyroidism. Patients usually present with a finding of hypercalcemia with
normal renal function. Malignancy must be ruled out in patients with
hypercalcemia and an elevated PTH level. Primary hyperparathyroidism is
usually the result of a single benign adenoma; a minority of patients will
have hyperplasia of all four parathyroid glands. Parathyroid carcinoma
accounts for an insignificant minority.

Secondary hyperparathyroidism
Secondary hyperparathyroidism is due to resistance to the actions of
PTH, usually from chronic renal failure. The bone disease in secondary
parathyroidism along with renal failure is termed renal osteodystrophy.

Tertiary hyperparathyroidism
Tertiary hyperparathyroidism is a rare form caused by long-lasting disorders
of the calcium feedback control system. When the hyperparathyroidism
cannot be corrected by medication, one calls it tertiary hyperparathyroidism.

Symptoms
Depending on the severity of the hypercalcemia and the duration of the
disorder, a variety of symptoms can occur. Most cases of primary hyperparathyroidism are asymptomatic. For late symptoms remember the
mnemonic, “painful bones, renal stones, abdominal groans, and psychic
moans”!

Treatment
Surgery to remove the enlarged gland (or glands) is the main treatment
for the disorder and cures it in 95% of operations.

Familial hypercalciuric hypercalcemia (FHH)
Also known as familial benign hypercalcemia, this is an autosomal
dominant disorder caused by a defect in a calcium-sensing receptor gene.
This disorder has similar symptoms to those of the more common primary hyperparathyroidism. It is important to differentiate the two
because parathyroidectomy is inappropriate in treatment of this disorder.
Differentiation from primary hyperparathyroidism can often be achieved
by measuring the renal calcium/creatinine clearance ratio, which generally
is less than 0.01 in patients with FHH and higher in patients with primary
hyperparathyroidism.

The external ear

Structure and function
A working knowledge of the anatomy of the ear helps in documentation
and correspondence and in describing sites of lesions and trauma over the
telephone. The main anatomical points are shown in Figs. 12.1. and 12.2.
The external part of the ear consists of two parts:
- The pinna
- The external auditory canal (EAC)
The pinna collects sound waves and directs them into the external
auditory canal. Its shape helps to localize sound direction and amplification.
The EAC helps in transmitting sound waves to the eardrum or tympanic
membrane.
The EAC has two parts:
- An outer cartilaginous part
- In adults, the cartilaginous canal slopes forward and downward.
- In neonates and infants, the canal slopes forward.
- The outer canal contains hairs and ceruminous glands that
produce wax.
- An inner bony part

CHAPTER 12

The external ear

Congenital abnormalities
Minor abnormalities of the ear are common, but often they do not come
to medical attention.

Malformed pinna
The pinna develops from the six hillocks of His. Maldevelopment or
failure to fuse can produce obvious abnormalities of the ear. Malformed
pinna are described as microtia or anotia. They may or may not be associated with middle or inner ear abnormalities. The various classifications
are shown in Fig. 12.3.
Investigations
This includes documenting the defect, examining the EAC, and doing a
hearing assessment. A CT scan to assess middle ear, ossicle, and cochlea
anatomy may also be done.
Treatment
- Where there are minor anatomical abnormalities, no treatment is
given or hearing support is given as required.
- Where there is a major deformity or anotia, reconstruction of the
pinna may be considered. Consider a bone-anchored hearing aid
(BAHA) and abutments for attaching an artificial pinna.

Skin tags
Preauricular or periauricular skin tags are often detected at a neonatal
baby check. They are often incidental. Investigations involve checking for
normal EAC and screening hearing.

Preauricular sinus
This is a small dimple anterior to the tragus. It is usually detected at a
baby check and is caused by the incomplete fusion of the hillocks of His.
This preauricular dimple may be the external opening of a network of
channels under the skin. Patients who present late may have a discharge
from the punctum. Occasionally, repeated infections may require drainage.
Treatment
Where there is simple discharge, treat with oral antibiotics such as
Augmentin. Where there are repeated infections, antibiotics may be

CHAPTER 12

The external ear

Infection of the pinna
This would present as a painful, hot, red ear.

Investigations
- Identify the cause of the infection. Is this a spreading infection from the
EAC or is it a primary infection of the pinna?
- Identify whether it is an infection of the skin or whether it involves
cartilage. If the cartilage is infected, there is severe tenderness on
touching the pinna (see Box 12.1).
- Take a history and exclude trauma or an insect bite. Remember to
consider nonaccidental injury in children. Diabetic or immunocompromised patients may have severe cellulitis of the pinna.

Treatment
- Where there is a localized infection, remove any cause such as jewelry
piercing or an insect’s sting. Give oral antibiotics such as Ciprofloxain
or Augmentin.
- Where there is cellulitis of the pinna, remove the cause and treat with
IV antibiotics such as cefuroxime 1.5 g 8 hourly and metronidazole
500 mg tid IV 8 hourly until cellulitis resolves, for at least 24 hours,
followed by oral antibiotics for 1 week in total.
- Where there is perichondritis, remove the cause and treat otitis
externa if present. Treat with Ciprofloxacin or IV antibiotics such as
cefuroxime 1.5 g 8 hourly and metronidazole 500 mg tid IV 8 hourly
until cellulitis resolves, for at least 24 hours, followed by oral antibiotics
for 1 week in total.

Box 12.1 Piercings
- Trends in fashion dictate that piercings are often multiple and not in
the lobule of the ear. Lobule piercings have less likelihood of infection, as there is no cartilage in the lobule.
- Other piercings transfix the cartilage framework of the pinna.
This can lead to infection and cellulitis of the pinna.

CHAPTER 12

The external ear

Trauma to the pinna
Assess the patient, bearing in mind that a blow to the ear is a head
injury. Discover the force and mechanism of the injury. The site of the
injury should be carefully documented with the help of a diagram or a
photograph.
Any blunt trauma to the ear may cause a hearing loss or a traumatic
perforation of the eardrum. Always examine the EAC drum and perform
a simple bedside hearing assessment as follows:
- Examine the pinna and note the findings.
- Examine the EAC.
- Examine the tympanic membrane.
- Perform tuning fork tests.
- Perform free-field testing of hearing.
- Check patient’s tetanus status.

Lacerations of the skin
These are simply repaired, using nonabsorbable sutures such as 5.0
Prolene. Apply local anesthetic to the area, clean the wound, and use
interrupted sutures. Pay careful attention to everting the edges and
ensuring good opposition of the skin edges. Check the patient’s tetanus
status.

Lacerations involving the cartilage
- Clean wounds can be simply sutured in layers to include the cartilage.
- The cartilage is very painful to suture and a general anesthetic (GA)
may be required.
- Dirty wounds may need surgical debridement before closure.
- All wounds require antibiotic cover such as Ciprofloxacin or
Augmentin.

Hematoma of the pinna
This is a collection of blood between the perichondrium and the cartilage
which leads to pressure necrosis of the cartilage. Subsequent deformity,
infection, and fibrosis with cartilage loss lead to the typical “cauliflower
ear” of the wrestler.
Aspiration of the hematoma is difficult because of the thickness of the
clot. It is better to incise the hematoma and suture, using bolsters to
prevent re-accumulation (see Fig. 12.5).
Treatment
- Local anesthetic (LA) or GA
- Incision over hematoma
- Dental roll bolsters tied in place
- Removal of dressing after 5 days
- Oral antibiotics.

CHAPTER 12

The external ear

Otitis externa
This common condition forms a large percentage of both the emergency
and routine workload of an Otolaryngology department. Its presentation
is varied and it produces a spectrum of disorders, classified below.

Risk factors
-

Swimmers and surfers
Diabetics
Immunosuppressed patients (HIV)
Psoriasis sufferers
People with an abnormal migration of keratin

Clinical grading
- Is the pinna normal? If there is cellulitis, admission may be needed—
severe otitis externa (OE)
- What is the appearance of the EAC after cleaning under microscope?
- Is the EAC of normal diameter?—mild OE
- Is the EAC narrow but the tympanic membrane (TM) still visible?—
moderate OE
- Is the EAC narrow but the TM not visible due to edema?—severe OE
- Is there a furuncle in the EAC?
- Are there granulations in the floor of the EAC? This may be necrotizing
OE (see p. 244)
- Test the patient’s facial nerve function.

Treatment
All patients should keep ears water-free during treatment.
Mild OE
Presentation is scaly skin with some erythema. Treat as follows:
- Use either 0.5% hydrocortisone cream prn to be applied to the EAC,
- Acetic acid ear drops. Lowering of the pH changes the flora of the EAC.
- Perform regular aural toilet and avoid swimming.
Moderate OE
Presentation is of painful, discharging, smelly ears. There is a narrowed
EAC with cream cheese–like discharge. Treat as follows:
- Do microsuction clearance.
- Swab for microscopy if there has been previous antibiotic treatment.
- Otowick if the EAC very narrow.
- Use hygroscopic drops, e.g., aluminium acetate.
- Change wick in 48 hours.
- Swab if no improvement. Consider combination therapy with antibiotic
steroid drops depending on swab result and response to treatment.

OTITIS EXTERNA 1

Severe OE
Presentation is complete occlusion of the EAC or spreading pinna cellulitis.
Treat as follows:
- Do microsuction clearance.
- Treat as moderate OE.
- If there is severe pain, it may be furunculosis. Lance boil with a needle
or fine end of sucker. Add Ciprofloxin 500 mg bid po to regime.
- If there is cellulitis, admission for IV antibiotics may be needed.
- Exclude the tympanic membrane during treatment.

Be aware of allergy
Patients not responding to the appropriate therapy may be allergic to the
constituents of the drops. Patch testing may help to elucidate this problem.

243

244

CHAPTER 12

The external ear

Necrotizing otitis externa
This is an uncommon, severe, bacterial ear infection where the infection
spreads beyond the ear canal and into the surrounding bone. It is also
known as malignant otitis externa because of the mortality associated
with the condition. It is usually seen in diabetics or immunocompromised
patients. If you see a diabetic patient with otitis externa, consider this
condition.

Signs and symptoms
- Otalgia is out of proportion to the clinical appearance of the EAC.
- There is granulation tissue in the floor of the EAC at the junction of
the bony and cartilaginous parts of the canal.
- Microvascular disease predisposes to an osteomyelitis that spreads
across the skull base. Cranial nerves VII and IX–XII may be affected.
The opposite side of the skull base can be affected.
- Pseudomonas is the most common pathogen on culture.

Management
-

Admit patient for assessment.
Take a full history.
Make a thorough ENT examination.
Check cranial nerves.
Perform an aural toilet.
Perform a biopsy of the ear canal under GA or LA to exclude
malignancy
Do a CT scan to examine the appearance of the skull base and to
stage the extent of the disease.
Give ciprofloxacin drops.
Give oral ciprofloxacin.
Involve the infectious disease team.
Continue with drug therapy for 6–12 weeks.
Perform a surgical debridement only if the patient does not respond to
treatment or if there is skull base extension.

Be aware of malignancy
If things fail to settle or if the condition progresses, don’t forget, there may
be a possible malignant cause. An initial negative biopsy may be wrong.
Consider further deep biopsy or cortical mastoidectomy for histology.

CHAPTER 12

The external ear

Malignancy of the pinna
- The pinna is a common site for malignant skin lesions to develop.
- The types of cancer are basal cell carcinoma (BCC), squamous cell
carcinoma (SCC), and malignant melanoma.

Risk factors
-

Sun exposure
Previous skin cancers
Chemical exposure
Xeroderma pigmentosum.

Investigations and treatment
It is sometimes possible to make a diagnosis based on clinical observation.
Usually excision biopsy is the treatment of choice. Histological examination can confirm the type of malignancy. Further wider excision with or
without grafting can be undertaken.

Special reconstructions of the pinna
The unique appearance and structure of the pinna lead to several methods
of reconstruction after tumor removal. The aim is to preserve the structure of the pinna and its cosmetic appearance without compromising
curative removal. See Fig. 12.6.
If there is gross cartilage involvement, it may be necessary to remove
the pinna entirely.

CHAPTER 12

The external ear

Malignancy of the external
auditory canal
This is a rare condition, but it forms an important differential diagnosis in
dealing with infections or masses in the ear. When seen, it usually affects
the elderly. SCC is the most common type of malignancy.

Signs and symptoms
-

A growth in the EAC
An otitis externa
Facial nerve palsy
Other cranial nerve palsies such as IX–XII
Lymph node metastases

Management
-

Treat any infection.
Biopsy the lesion.
Perform CT scan to stage the lesion.
Perform MRI scan to assess intracranial spread.

Treatment options
-

Palliative
Curative
Radiotherapy
Surgery

Prognosis
The outlook for these patients is universally poor, with low 5-year survival
rates.

CHAPTER 12

The external ear

Miscellaneous conditions
Exostoses
Exostoses are the most common bony abnormality of the EAC; they are
present in approximately 1 out of every 150 patients examined for otolaryngologic problems. Bony exostoses manifest as a gradual narrowing
of the bony canal by broad-based mounds of bone that arise from the
anterior and posterior canal walls.
- They usually occur in individuals with a history of cold-water exposure
(such as swimmers or surfers).
- They usually occur bilaterally and are generally asymptomatic.
- Symptoms such as conductive hearing loss and otitis externa can arise
if the canal becomes occluded.
- Histologic findings include a dense, stratified arrangement of new bone
that is remodeled over time into normal lamellar bone.
Treatment
Surgery is indicated if the patient becomes symptomatic. A canalplasty is
usually performed.

Osteoma
An osteoma manifests as a discrete, pedunculated bony mass that arises
from the tympanosquamous suture line adjacent to the bony–cartilaginous
junction.
- It is usually solitary and unilateral.
- These are the most common bony neoplasms of the external ear canal
- Like exostoses, osteomas are usually asymptomatic; however, symptoms can arise if canal obstruction occurs.
- No link to cold-water exposure or radiation has been demonstrated.
- Histology reveals well-formed lamellae with multiple fibrovascular
channels throughout the interlamellar spaces.
Treatment is similar to that for exostoses.

Relapsing polychondritis
This is an autoimmune disorder in which an individual exhibits a systemic
destruction of articular and nonarticular cartilage. It characteristically
affects the head and neck (e.g., eyes, ears, eustachian tube, nose), respiratory system (e.g., larynx, trachea, bronchi), cardiovascular system (e.g.,
heart valves, blood vessels), and joints. The external ear is affected in
almost 90% of cases. Auricular signs and systems affected:
- Recurrent cellulitis of one or both pinna. The earlobes are typically
spared.
- Destruction of EAC cartilage may result in conductive hearing loss.
Treatment is with systemic corticosteroids, NSAIDs, or colchicines.

MISCELLANEOUS CONDITIONS 1

Ramsay Hunt syndrome
Also known as herpes zoster oticus, this syndrome is caused by varicellazoster viral infection. It has the following symptoms:
- Facial nerve paralysis
- Sensorineural hearing loss
- Bullous myringitis and a vesicular eruption of the concha of the pinna
and the EAC
Treatment includes use of an antiviral agent (e.g., valacyclovir) and systemic
steroids.

CHAPTER 13

The middle ear

Structure and function
The middle ear is made up of the following structures (see p. 235,
Fig. 12.2):
- Tympanic membrane
- Ossicular chain
- Nerves of the middle ear
- Muscles of the middle ear
- Mastoid air cell system
- Eustachian tube
The function of the middle ear is to transduce sound waves, amplify
them, and pass them to the cochlea. There is also an intrinsic mechanism
to protect the ear from loud noise.

Tympanic membrane
The tympanic membrane (Fig. 13.1) is composed of three layers. It is
divided into the pars flaccida and the pars tensa by the anterior and
posterior malleolar folds. These two parts differ in their strength. The pars
tensa has collagen fibers arranged radially, and the flaccida has randomly
arranged collagen and a high elastin content. The squamous epithelium
grows from central drum germinal centers. It then migrates radially and
out along the external auditory canal (EAC) to be shed at the external
auditory meatus (EAM).

The ossicular chain
The malleus, incus, and stapes conduct and amplify sound. The difference
in contact area between the drum and the malleus compared to the
contact area between the stapes and the oval window leads to an amplification. When this is added to the mechanical advantage of the articulated
ossicular chain, the total amplification is in the order of 22 times.

Nerves of the middle ear
The facial nerve has an intricate course. The chorda tympani is a branch
of the facial nerve. The tympanic plexus has secretomotor fibers to the
parotid. (see Fig. 13.2)

Muscles of the middle ear
The stapedius contracts and damps the movement of stapes. The tensor
tympani contracts and stabilizes the movement of the malleus. Both of
these mechanisms protect the ear from loud noise.

Mastoid air cell system
This connects with the middle ear via the antrum. It provides a reservoir
of air to balance vast changes in air pressure.

Eustachian tube
This tube provides a mechanism for the equalization of air pressure on
either side of the eardrum.

CONGENITAL ABNORMALITIES 1

Congenital abnormalities
Congenital abnormalities of the middle ear are rare in isolation.
Middle ear abnormalities are more common in association with microtia
(see p. 236). Abnormalities of the ossicular chain can occur in isolation.

Signs and symptoms
- Conductive hearing loss is never more than 60 dB.
- Normal tympanogram/As type/Ad type.

Management
- Diagnosis is usually suggested on CT and confirmed by performing a
tympanotomy.
- If the abnormality is in the better hearing ear, use a hearing aid.
Surgery carries a higher risk of permanent sensorineural loss.
- If the abnormality is in the worse hearing ear, then consider a
tympanotomy after a trial of a hearing aid.

257

258

CHAPTER 13

The middle ear

Acute otitis media
This is a very common condition (see Fig. 13.3). Almost everyone will
suffer with acute otitis media during their lifetime. Signs and symptoms
may include a preceding URTI, severe and progressive otalgia, or a discharge—this is usually associated with a resolution of the otalgia.
A diagnosis is made by taking a history, examining the tympanic membrane,
and taking the patient’s temperature.
Treatment for acute otitis media is controversial. Systematic review
suggests treatment with analgesia only. However, these reviews may have
included a high proportion of viral ear infections, for which antibiotics
would not be expected to be useful.

Management
-

Give analgesia in all cases.
Give oral antibiotics for 1 week.
Discharge may continue for 1 week.
When infection has resolved, always check that the tympanic membrane
is normal.

Recurrent infections of the middle ear
These must be differentiated from one persisting infection. Treat any acute
infection actively as above. If the patient has more than five infections in
6 months, then consider alternative treatment.

Treatment
- Medical—consider prophylactic therapy.
- Surgical—if there is effusion or glue ear consider grommet insertion
± adenoidectomy.
- All treatment needs monitoring—use an infection diary to record
episodes of infection pre- and post-treatment.

Caution
Acute otitis media is often misdiagnosed. Children with nocturnal earache often have glue ear or eustachian tube dysfunction. The tympanic
membrane may be red or injected, but there is no discharge and the pain
resolves very quickly upon waking.

CHAPTER 13

The middle ear

Complications of acute otitis media
Chronic infection
- The infection may persist and become chronic. This may be due to
resistant bacteria. Use a broad-spectrum antibiotic such as
Ciprofloxacin.
- Consider myringotomy for relief of symptoms or to obtain microbiological information.

Facial nerve palsy
- Ten percent of people have a dehiscent facial nerve when the bony
covering is absent over the nerve. This results in facial nerve irritation
and palsy.
- The patient must be admitted to the hospital and given IV antibiotics
and steroids.
- Consider myringotomy and grommet insertion if the condition fails to
resolve in 24 hours.

Acute mastoiditis
This is an infection of the mastoid air cells that will lead to a severe
earache with tenderness, swelling and redness behind the pinna. The pinna
may also be pushed forward, making it look more prominent.
This is an ENT emergency and requires admission and IV antibiotics
and possible surgical drainage.

Perforation of tympanic membrane
Repeated infections that perforate the tympanic membrane can lead to
perforations that do not heal.

Sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL)
Rarely, toxins can spread to the inner ear to produce a sensorineural
hearing loss. This is a greater risk with recurrent infection.

Vertigo
Infection near the lateral semicircular canal can produce a para labrynthitis. This can cause a spectrum of vestibular disturbance ranging from
mild unsteadiness to disabling vertigo.

GLUE EAR 1

Glue ear
Glue ear is caused by a combination of exposure to infection and a nonfunctioning eustachian tube. Almost 8 out of 10 children will have glue
ear at some time during childhood. The incidence of glue ear decreases
with age as the immune system develops and the eustachian tube
becomes larger.
The signs and symptoms of glue ear can include decreased hearing,
recurrent ear infections, poor speech development, failing performance
at school and, sometimes, antisocial behavior.

Risk factors
-

Smoking parents
Bottle feeding
Day-care nursery
Cleft palate
Atopy

Investigations
Take a full history, do a full examination including the palate, and carry
out age-appropriate audiometry (see p. 70) and tympanometry.

Management
This depends on a balance of the following:
- Social factors—more urgent action is needed if the family is unlikely to
make it to further appointments.
- Hearing disability—how the child is coping with their hearing problem
socially and at school is more important than the actual level of
hearing loss.
- Appearance of tympanic membranes—if there is gross retraction,
intervention may be needed to avoid retraction pocket formation.

Treatment
There are three options:
- Watchful waiting—this should apply to all patients for 3 months, as
glue ear will resolve in 50% of cases.
- Hearing aid—there is a window of opportunity at 4–8 years old. It is
noninvasive, but may lead to teasing at school.
- Insertion of grommets—short general anesthetic (GA) and adenoidectomy—see p. 366.

CHAPTER 13

The middle ear

Chronic suppurative without cholesteatoma
Chronic suppurative otitis media
without cholesteatoma
This common condition is associated with eustachian tube dysfunction
with or without an infection in the mastoid. As with other ear diseases,
its prevalence continues despite antibiotics.
The signs and symptoms of chronic suppurative otitis media include
continuous recurrent otorrhea, perforation in tympanic membrane
(Fig. 13.4, usually central), and no cholesteatoma present.

Risk factors
-

Smoking patient
Smoking parents
Acute otitis media
Decreased immunity

Investigations
- Take a full history and do an ENT examination.
- Do a microscopy of the eardrum with thorough cleaning.
- Take a swab for microbiology.

Management
- Give appropriate topical and systemic antibiotics based on the swab
result. The condition may settle with antibiotics and water precautions.
- Perform a regular aural toilet.
- Persistent infections may need surgery in the form of myringoplasty
and mastoidectomy.

CHAPTER 13

The middle ear

Chronic suppurative otitis media with
cholesteatoma
This is often divided into congenital and acquired:
- Congenital cholesteatoma results from an abnormal focus of
squamous epithelium in the middle ear space, i.e., a dermoid.
- Acquired cholesteatoma results from chronic eustachian tube
dysfunction.
- Acquired cholesteatoma is further subdivided into primary and
secondary forms.
It was hoped that the incidence of this condition would change with the
advent of antibiotics. Unfortunately, the disease continues, presenting at
any age. Signs and symptoms include recurrent otitis media with a smelly
mucopurulent discharge, hearing loss, facial nerve palsy, and vertigo.

Development of a cholesteatoma
Primary acquired cholesteatoma develops from a pars flaccida retraction
pocket. Prolonged low middle-ear pressure allows for propagation of the
pocket. The pocket neck becomes small compared to the sac itself.
Initially, squamous epithelium migrates with ease through the pocket.
As the sac gets bigger the squamous epithelium builds up inside the
pocket. Eventually germinal centers are incorporated. Infection supervenes
on the impacted squamous epithelium/keratin.
Secondary acquired cholesteatoma develops from a perforation in the
pars tensa. Epithelium then invades the middle ear and a cholesteatoma is
formed.

Investigations
-

Aural toilet
Microscopy and suction clearance
Topical antibiotic/steroid drops for 10 days
Review under the microscope after 1 month
Audiometry
CT scan of the temporal bone to look for pneumatization of the
mastoid or erosion of the scutum.

Management
This depends on the age and fitness of the patient, which ear is affected,
the patient’s wishes, and their ability to tolerate ear toilet.
Prophylaxis This is a controversial treatment in which early retraction
pockets are treated by inserting a grommet to reverse the development
of a cholesteatoma.
Early retraction pocket Attempt to clean the pocket and remove keratin.
GA may be required. Maintenance of a cleaned pocket can be undertaken
with regular aural toilet.

CHRONIC SUPPURATIVE OTITIS MEDIA WITH CHOLESTEATOMA 1

Established non-cleaning pocket If the worse hearing ear is affected,
surgery will be required to remove the risk of intracerebral complications.
See Mastoid surgery, p. 266.

Follow-up
These patients are at risk of recurrence and need careful follow-up.

265

266

CHAPTER 13

The middle ear

Mastoid surgery
Cortical mastoidectomy
A simple opening of the mastoid and ablation of the individual air cell are
performed to create one large cavity or drain pus. This procedure was
frequently performed in the pre-antibiotic ear to treat acute mastoiditis,
but is now much less common and usually performed as part of a more
complicated mastoid operation.

Modified radical mastoidectomy (MRM)
See Fig. 13.5. This is performed to remove cholesteatoma from the middle
ear and mastoid. The cholesteatoma, head of the malleus, and incus are all
removed and the connections between the middle ear cleft and mastoid
are enlarged. A “mastoid cavity” is created by removal of the posterior
canal wall; this may require cleaning in outpatients.

Combined approach tympanoplasty (CAT) (canal wall-up
mastoidectomy)
This operation is also performed for cholesteatoma, but here the posterior
canal wall remains intact and no cavity is formed. The eardrum looks
normal after the operation. Benefits of this approach include less outpatient care, better hearing results, and patients being better able to tolerate
swimming. However, since cholesteatoma can be “sealed in” behind an
intact drum, a “second-look” operation is required at 6–12 months to
ensure that the disease has been eradicated.

268

CHAPTER 13

The middle ear

Complications of chronic suppurative
otitis media
These are related to local and distant effects of cholesteatoma (see Fig. 13.6).

Local effects
Conductive hearing loss Because the retracted attic segment of the eardrum lies against the long process of the eardrum, it interferes with its
already tenuous blood supply. The incus initially thins, then loses its
attachment to the stapes. The cholesteatoma can bridge this gap and
temporarily improve the conductive loss.
Sensorineural hearing loss The toxic effect of the local infection can
cause a sensorineural hearing loss.
Vertigo may be due to a paralabrynthitis causing an irritative vestibulopathy, or it may be the result of erosion into the lateral semicircular canal,
called a fistula.
Facial nerve dysfunction If a dehiscence exists, infection can produce
direct irritation of the nerve. The cholesteatoma may also directly erode
the bony covering of the facial nerve.
Mastoiditis A chronic infection may lead to mastoiditis.

Distant effects
Meningitis The roof of the middle ear is also the floor of the middle
cranial fossa. A thin plate of bone separates the middle ear from the
meninges in this area. This can be eroded by an extensive cholesteatoma,
with a spread of infection to the meninges.
Cerebral abscess A spread of infection can lead to abscess formation,
which can progress to the temporal lobe.
Lateral sinus thrombosis The lateral sinus is one of the relations of the
mastoid air cell systems. Infection can spread to the lateral sinus, causing
local thrombosis. This in turn can lead to hydrocephalus.
Bezolds abscess Infection from the mastoid spreads through the mastoid
tip and travels under the sternocleidomastoid muscle. It then points in
the neck anterior to the muscle.
Citellis abscess Infection spreads medially from the mastoid tip to collect
in the digastric fossa.

CHAPTER 13

The middle ear

Otosclerosis
This is an osseous dyscrasia of the temporal bone. It presents as a slowly
progressive hearing loss, usually beginning in the patient’s twenties. There
is usually a family history of the condition. The patient may have difficulty
hearing when chewing and may have problems with quiet conversations.
Tinnitus occurs in 69%–80% of these patients. Dizziness is rarely caused
by this condition. There is no history of infection.
In its early stages the lesion is “spongiotic.” Later, this spongiosis
becomes sclerosis or a combination of these two abnormal bone types.
Later, osteocytes at the edge of the lesion extend into the bone, surrounding the central vascular spaces. Stapes fixation occurs when the
annular ligament or stapes footplate becomes involved. Spread to the
cochlea produces high-tone sensorineural hearing loss.

Incidence
-

The female-to-male ratio is 2 to 1.
6.4% of temporal bones have evidence of otosclerosis.
0.3% of the population has a clinical manifestation of the disease.
The condition is bilateral in 70% of patients.
50% of patients with otosclerosis have a family history.

Investigations
- Check for a normal mobile, intact tympanic membrane.
- Look for “Schwartzes sign”—a flamingo pink blush anterior to the oval
window. This means there is increased vascular supply to the
otospongiotic focus.
- Perform pure tone audiometry. This shows conductive hearing loss
(CHL) typical of a Carhart’s notch (see Fig. 13.7).
- Check for absent stapedial reflex.
- Carry out a CT scan—this may help to exclude other bony abnormalities of the middle ear such as ossicular fixation.

Differential diagnosis
Paget’s disease There is other bony involvement (e.g., frontal bossing),
increased alkaline phosphatase, and mixed hearing loss.
Osteogenesis imperfecta Also known as Van der Hoeve syndrome, this
condition leads to mixed hearing loss with blue sclera. There is frequently
a history of multiple bony fractures.

Treatment
The options are as follows:
- No treatment
- Hearing aid
- Surgery—stapedectomy after a 3-month trial of hearing aid

Contra-indications to surgery
- Surgery should be performed on a worse-hearing ear only.
- Previous sensorineural hearing loss in contralateral ear.
- If there is tympanic membrane perforation, this will necessitate a
myringoplasty first.
- Infection.

OTOSCLEROSIS 1

Cochlear otosclerosis
This is due to spread of the otosclerotic process to the basal turn of the
cochlea. Treatment with sodium fluoride helps to reduce the abnormal
bone metabolism and thus stabilize hearing loss. Monitor with serial pure
tone audiograms.

CHAPTER 13

The middle ear

Trauma
Acoustic trauma
Loud noise can produce direct traumatic effects on the middle ear. See
Chapter 14, p. 275 (noise-induced hearing loss).

Head injury
Direct blows to the head can produce:
- A temporal bone fracture—p. 324
- A coexistent hemotympanum—blood in the middle ear
- Ossicular chain disruption
- Rarely, cochlea concussion can produce an SNHL.

Management
Patients with severe trauma may present late to ENT, as they usually
have more pressing priorities in their management. Treat the patient’s
head injury and check for a cervical spine injury. Perform an otoscoopy
(see Box 13.1) and look for CSF otorrhea. Check the facial nerve function.

Hearing assessment
- A tuning fork test will distinguish CHL from SNHL.
- Pure tone audiogram will confirm the tuning fork findings and will
quantify any hearing defect.

Treatment
SNHL Consider steroids. Give prednisolone 1 mg/kg po 1 week if there
are no contraindications. Follow with serial audiograms.
CHL No immediate treatment is required. Review as outpatient in 6 weeks.
The hemotympanum will have resolved. Retest the patient’s hearing. If CHL
persists, check the tympanogram to ensure that there is no glue ear and
consider tympanotomy with ossicular reconstruction.

Box 13.1 Pens, cotton tip applicators, and sticks
If these objects are inserted into the EAC they rarely reach the
eardrum. They usually impact on the skin of the EAC and tear it, causing
bleeding. Careful examination with the otoscope can usually identify this
problem.
Traumatic perforations of the TM heal sponataneously. Treat hemotympanum and possible ossicular dislocation as above.

NEOPLASIA 1

Neoplasia
Benign and malignant tumors involving the middle ear space can occur,
but these are very rare.

CHAPTER 14

The inner ear

Structure and function of the
inner ear
The inner ear can be divided into two parts, the cochlea and the vestibular
system (Fig. 14.1).

Cochlea
This is the organ of sound transduction. The cochlea is coiled as a helical
form and is encased in hard bone of the petrous temporal bone.
The specialized structure of the cochlea turns sound waves into electrical
signals that pass to the brain.
The cochlea has a tonotopic representation—this means that different
areas are frequency specific. High frequencies are dealt with at the start
or at the base of the cochlea. Low tones are dealt with at the cochlea
apex. See Fig. 14.2 for a cross-section of the cochlea.
The neurological pathway to the auditory cortex is best remembered
by using the E COLI mnemonic: Eighth nerve, Cochlear nucleus, superior
Olive, Lateral lemniscus, Inferior colliculus.

CHAPTER 14

The inner ear

Vestibular system
The vestibular system functions to provide information about angular and
linear acceleration for the brain. It is also encased in the petrous temporal
bone.
Five separate neuroepithelial elements work in combination to provide
this information: three semicircular canals, the utricle, and the saccule.
The semicircular canals are paired to provide complimentary information
about the direction of travel (Fig. 14.3). The inferior and superior vestibular
nerves pass the information to the brain. The ultrastructure of these
neuroepithelial elements is shown in Fig. 14.4.

CHAPTER 14

The inner ear

Sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL)
The etiology of such a hearing loss can usually be determined by careful
consideration of the patient’s history, a clinical examination, and the
findings of special investigations (see Table 14.1).
The age of onset of the patient’s hearing loss is important, as is any family
history of hearing loss. Careful consideration of a patient’s pregnancy and
perinatal history is also important.

Examination
The aim of this examination is to discover any congenital abnormality or
inherited syndrome in which hearing loss may play a part.

CHAPTER 14

The inner ear

Presbyacusis
This term describes a decreased peripheral auditory sensitivity. It is usually
age related and affects men more than women.

Signs and symptoms
This condition shows itself as bilateral and progressive, with symmetrical
SNHL and no history of noise exposure. The patient may have worse
speech discrimination than expected on review of the audiogram.
Decreasing central auditory discrimination leads to phonemic regression.

Investigations
- Otoscopy
- Pure tone audiogram (see Fig. 14.5)

Types of presbyacusis
Based on the shape of the audiogram and the site of loss, presbyacusis
can be subdivided into the following subtypes:
- Sensory presbyacusis: steep-sloping audiogram above speech frequency.
It starts in mid-life, so speech discrimination is preserved. There is
degeneration in the organ of Corti.
- Neural presbyacusis: down-sloping high-frequency loss. Audiogram
results are flatter than in sensory presbyacusis. There is thought to be
first-order neuron loss, along with a disproportionate discrimination
score.
- Strial presbyacusis: flat audiogram. There is good discrimination.
- Cochlear conductive/indeterminate presbyacusis: down-sloping audiogram. There is increasing stiffness of the basilar membrane.
- Central presbyacusis is marked by loss of GABA in the inferior
colliculus
- Middle-ear aging: loosening of ligaments or an ossicular articulation
problem occurs.

Management
The patient may be given counseling and advice about hearing loss and
given a hearing aid when the symptoms are troublesome.

CHAPTER 14

The inner ear

Noise-induced hearing loss
This is defined as damage to the inner ear caused by exposure to loud
noise. There is a relationship between the volume of sound and its duration that causes damage. Eight hours of exposure to a sound level of
85 dB usually causes damage. Louder sounds will cause damage at
shorter exposure times.
Acoustic trauma is caused by sounds greater than 180 dB. Rupture of
the tympanic membrane and ossicular fracture may occur.

Signs and symptoms
The patient will usually present with bilateral and symmetrical hearing
loss. There may be a noise-induced temporary threshold shift (TTS)—
for example, hearing may improve over the weekend if the problem is
noise at work. The patient may have difficulty hearing in the context of
background noise or they may have tinnitus.

Investigations
Use audiometry. For a typical pattern see Fig. 14.6.

Pathology
Hearing loss is greatest in the 3–6 kHz region of cochlea. Below 2 kHz
the acoustic reflex is protective. EAC resonant frequency is 1–4 kHz,
so energy delivered at these frequencies is greater. The actual loss of
cochlea cells occurs where noise damage is greatest. Outer hair cells lose
rigidity and the stereocilia fuse.

Management
Consider the following to prevent further noise damage:
- Health and safety at work
- Provision of ear plugs or muffs
- Routine hearing screening for occupations at risk
For established damage consider
- Hearing aids
- Counseling for tinnitus

2 Rifle shooting
This will sometimes result in an asymmetric SNHL with the noise-damaged
pattern. When firing a rifle, one ear is nearer to the gun barrel. If the
patient shoots right-handed, their LEFT ear is most affected, as it is nearer
to the barrel of the gun.

CHAPTER 14

The inner ear

Tinnitus
This is a sensation of a noise in the ear. It can exist with a hearing loss of
any cause and can even occur in patients with normal hearing. However, it
is most commonly associated with sensorineural hearing loss. Most people
will experience tinnitus at some time in their lives and for most it is no
more than a transient nuisance. In others, however, it is a troublesome
symptom that can trigger depression or even suicide. Tinnitus is usually
intrinsic, i.e., only heard by the patient.

Causes of intrinsic tinnitus
-

Drugs
Labyrinthitis
Trauma
Vascular
Presbycusis
Meniere’s disease
Noise-induced hearing loss
Otosclerosis
Acoustic neuroma

Cause of extrinsic tinnitus
- An insect in the ear canal
- Vascular malformations
- Palatal myoclonus

The tinnitus model
Experiments have shown that 95% of normal people will experience a
degree of tinnitus when put into a sound-proofed room. This means that the
ear and auditory pathways are producing “noise” or electrical activity that
even normally hearing people can recognize; however, our central auditory
pathways filter out this useless information, and we do not normally perceive
it. In fact, our CNS is constantly monitoring our surroundings, but little of
this is brought to our attention. For example, up to this point you were not
aware of your shoes on your feet, or the noise of passersby and traffic, but
now that they have been brought to your attention you have become aware
of them.
This screening system is essential to avoid sensation overload! It is
believed that tinnitus becomes problematic when this screening or filtering
process breaks down, and the “noise” that the ear generates is not discarded as useless information but is instead perceived as a threat, which by
itself triggers an emotional reaction via the limbic system.
Tinnitus retraining therapy seeks to reverse this process by counseling
the patient and removing the perception of noise as a threat (Fig. 14.7).
When meeting patients with tinnitus it is very important to avoid negative counseling such as the following: “Tinnitus—oh that’s awful. I would
hate to have that.” Or, “Tinnitus—well there is nothing that can be done
about that; you will just have to put up with it.” Sentiments such as these
will only serve to reinforce the negative feelings patients have about their
condition and turn their feelings of “threat” into feelings of hopelessness.

CHAPTER 14

The inner ear

Autoimmune ear disease
Autoimmune ear disease is classified as either organ specific or as a
systemic disease.

Organ specific
This type of disease shows vestibuloauditory autoimmunity or evidence
of cell-mediated immunity against inner ear antigens.

Systemic disease
This disease type is part of a recognized systemic autoimmune disease.
Common diseases that have auditory vestibular involvement are discussed
below. Patients with autoimmune ear disease are usually middle-aged and
are more likely to be female than male.

Signs and symptoms
- Bilateral unexplained SNHL
- May be fluctuant dizziness or Meniere’s-like syndrome with
aural fullness
- Rapidly progressive hearing loss over days or weeks
- Associated seventh-nerve palsy
- Normal otoscopic examination
- Coexistent systemic immune disease.

Investigations
Take a full history and give a full otoneurological examination, including a
pure tone audiogram. Order an MRI scan to exclude acoustic neuroma
with unilateral presentation.
Carry out the following blood tests:
- Antigen-specific antibodies
- Antigen-nonspecific antibodies
- Acute-phase reactants
- Lyme titers

Treatment
Treatment should be given under the guidance of a neurotolgist and/or a
rheumatologist. Give steroids such as prednisolone 1 mg/kg per day po
or give steroid-sparing alternatives:
- Cyclophosphamide
- Methotrexate
- Plasmaphoresis
The following conditions are thought to have an autoimmune basis and
can cause hearing loss.

Polyarteritis nodosa
This condition affects the small and medium arteries. There is a rare
association with an inner ear hearing loss.

AUTOIMMUNE EAR DISEASE 1

Cogan’s syndrome
This is a nonsyphilitic interstitial keratitis with vestibuloauditory dysfunction.
It presents with photophobia and lacrimation 1 to 6 months before vestibuloauditory symptoms develop.

Atypical cogan’s
This interstitial keratitis develops 1 to 2 years before auditory vestibular
problems.

Wegener’s granulomatosis
This is a necrotizing granulomatous vasculitis of the lower and upper
respiratory tract that also affects the kidneys, causing focal necrotizing
glomerulonephritis. Typically, 90% of patients have a sensorineural hearing
loss and 20% have a conductive hearing loss with effusion. Also, 90% of
patients are cANCA positive.

Relapsing polychondritis
In this condition, giant-cell arteritis and systemic vasculitis cause recurrent
episodes of inflammatory necrosis. There is a raised ESR and a false positive
VDRL.

Rheumatoid arthritis
This is a very common condition with characteristic arthropathy.

291

292

CHAPTER 14

The inner ear

Ototoxicity
Because drugs can damage the cochlea and vestibular system, it is worth
taking a careful drug history, as a wide range of drugs can cause symptoms. Check with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or the
Physician’s Desk Reference (PDR) for side effects.

Aminoglycoside antibiotics
These antibiotics have a narrow therapeutic index and can cause damage
to the inner ear. Common side effects are drug-induced vestibular symptoms and hearing loss.
Patients requiring parenteral aminoglycoside antibiotics should have
the plasma levels of the drug monitored during therapy. Local policy
varies; often trough levels of antibiotic are used to determine future dose
levels.

Topical antibiotics
Most topical antibiotics available contain an aminoglycoside antibiotic.
These drugs are experimentally ototoxic in guinea pigs and other animals.
They are believed to enter the inner ear through the round-window
membrane, causing direct ototoxic effects. Drug data sheets also warn of
the risks of using these preparations when there are grommets in situ or
there is a perforation of the TM.
2 Short courses of these topical antibiotics—less than 10 days—are safe
for treating perforations or grommets in the presence of infection.
Edema of the middle ear mucosa with a thickened round-window membrane limits the entry of antibiotic into the inner ear. Untreated infection
is a greater risk to hearing than the antibiotic.

Therapeutic uses
Aminoglycosides can be used to treat patients with Meniere’s disease by
causing a vestibulopathy when instilled into the middle ear. Much higher
doses are used than with the standard drops.

Other drugs
Chemotherapy, especially cisplatin, induces SNHL. Aspirin and erythromycin can cause a reversible SNHL. Patients present with tinnitus.
Vancomycin and loop diuretics can also cause ototoxicity.

CHAPTER 14

The inner ear

Hereditary hearing loss
Heredited hearing loss may be divided into syndromic and nonsyndromic types. Non-syndromic or nonorganic hearing loss is most
common, representing about two-thirds of cases.
As the loci of genes associated with hearing loss are identified, it
becomes more obvious that the classifying of these conditions on a syndromic basis may be misleading. Many patients with apparently nonsyndromic hereditary hearing loss have the same gene alterations as their
syndromic counterparts but are not phenotypically syndromic.
Other classifications of hereditary hearing loss are as follows:

Branchial-oto-renal (BOR) syndrome
In this rare condition there is an association of branchial fistulas or cysts
with hearing problems and renal abnormalities.

Alport syndrome
This is a rare hereditary, progressive glomerulonephritis with SNHL.
It presents as hearing loss and renal problems. There are six subtypes of
Alport syndrome, classified by type of inheritance, age of onset of renal
failure, presence of hearing loss, and ocular abnormalities. The diagnosis
of Alport syndrome depends on three of the following features being
found:
- Positive family history of hematuria and renal failure
- Electron-microscopic evidence of glomerulonephritis on renal biopsy
- Characteristic ophthalmic signs
- Progressive high-frequency SNHL starting in childhood

Pendred syndrome
This is a rare autosomal recessive, inherited condition in which a nontoxic goiter is found in association with profound congenital SNHL. It is
associated with the mondini deformity of the cochlea.

Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome
This condition is believed to be autosomal recessive. The abnormality is
located on chromosome 11. There is a prolonged QT interval on EKG.
Multiple syncopal episodes may occur from the age of 3–5 years on.

Usher syndrome
This is an autosomal recessive condition consisting of retinitis pigmentosa
and hearing impairment.

NONORGANIC HEARING LOSS (NOHL) 1

Nonorganic hearing loss (NOHL)
This describes a situation in which a patient claims to have a hearing loss
where none exists, or one in which a patient exaggerates a hearing loss
that does exist.
A typical example may be a child who is having difficulties at school or
at home, and who presents with a very poor hearing test result. Often
the hearing loss documented on the audiogram will seem out of keeping
with the child’s participation in the consultation. Another example is a
patient who is pursuing a claim for damages as a result of a hearing loss.
The clues to look for when diagnosing this condition are concerns
raised by the audiologist about inconsistent results, litigation involvement,
or unusual parent–child interaction.

Investigations
- Pure tone audiometry
- Stenger test
- Speech audiogram—it is more difficult to fabricate an abnormal
response.
- Stapedial reflex testing
- Delayed speech feedback—the patient reads aloud and their speech is
played into the affected ear. The playback is slightly delayed, which will
cause the patient to hesitate or stutter if they can hear.
- Brainstem-evoked auditory response—this is the gold standard in
litigation cases.

Management
Careful handling of nonorganic hearing loss is required. It may be wise to
suggest to affected children that you know their hearing is better, but
don’t be too confrontational. Bring them back for another audiogram and
suggest that they try to be a little more accurate.
Litigation claims need more tact and multiple investigations before
undertaking any confrontation.

Stenger test
Use two 512 Hz tuning forks. This test can also be performed in the
audiology booth.
Step 1
The patient closes their eyes and the examiner stands behind the patient.
The tuning fork is activated and placed 5 cm from each ear in turn.
The patient will hear the note in their good ear but deny hearing it in the
nonhearing ear.
Step 2
Both tuning forks are used without the patient realizing it. One is held
5 cm from the ear with the alleged poor hearing. The other is held, at the
same time, 15 cm away from the good ear. The patient with NOHL will
deny hearing any sound. The tuning fork held near the bad ear will mask
the sound of the tuning fork near the good ear. The genuine patient will
only hear the tuning fork near the good ear.

CHAPTER 14

The inner ear

Labyrinthitis (vestibular neuronitis)
This presents as a sudden episode of vertigo in a previously well person.
It is equally common in men and women, with the usual age of onset
being 30 to 40 years. Attacks are usually single, but people may occasionally experience multiple attacks, and it can be recurrent. It normally lasts
1–2 days and improves over weeks. Vertigo is usually unilateral or, rarely,
bilateral. Epidemics can occur in the spring or summer. There may be an
associated URTI 2 weeks prior to the vertigo. It occasionally leaves a
BPPV symptom complex.

Pathology
- Axonal loss—endoneurial fibrosis and atrophy of the nerve
- Suspected viral etiology, e.g., rubeola, HSV, reovirus, CMV, influenza,
and mumps

Investigations
-

Pure tone audiograms
Nystagmus away from affected side
Quix test positive (seated Romberg test)
ENG if there is clinical doubt about the diagnosis
MRI if there is asymmetry or recurrent episodes

Treatment
- Vestibular suppressant for acute attack—Stemetil 5 mg sub-buccal/
12.5 mg IM
- Steroids if there is SNHL—prednisolone 1 mg/kg for 1 week
- Patients usually compensate well for this condition.
- Vestibular rehabilitation for patients who do not compensate

CHAPTER 14

The inner ear

Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo
This is the most common cause of peripheral vertigo. It usually starts
around the age of 50 years. The patient experiences brief episodes of
vertigo caused by changes in position, in particular looking up and rolling
over in bed. It is worse in the morning and evening. This condition is
believed to occur as a result of stimulation of the semicircular canals by
otoliths that have become misplaced.
There are three typical patterns in benign paroxysmal positional vertigo
(BPPV):
- Acute form—resolves in 3 months
- Intermittent form—active and inactive periods over years
- Chronic form—has continuous symptoms over longer duration

Investigations
-

Full otoneurological examination
Dix-Hallpike test
Pure tone audiogram
ENG if there is diagnostic uncertainty
MRI scan if symptoms persist for more than 3 months

Dix-Hallpike test
Have the patient sit on the examining table positioned in such a way that
when they lie back their head will be over the end of the bed. While the
patient is sitting, turn their head 30° toward the examiner. This leads to
maximal stimulation of the posterior semicircular canal (PSCC) on lying
down. Then ask the patient to lie down and look at the examiner’s nose.
The examiner supports the head and allows the head to extend over the
edge of the bed. A positive test results in rotatory nystagmus after a
delay of 1–5 seconds. This lasts between 10 and 30 seconds. Reversal to
the upright position changes the direction of the nystagmus. This process
is fatigable and sensitivity of the test can be improved with Frenzel
glasses, which do not allow optic fixation.

Treatment
Fatiguing exercises are used if the patient has significant symptom-free
episodes (see Fig. 14.10).
Epley maneuver can bring 90% relief if the patient has had symptoms, by
repositioning the displaced otoliths (see Fig. 14.11).
Surgery This is rare. A singular neurectomy may lead to SNHL in 10%–20%
of patients. A retrosigmoid vestibular nerve section may result in 1%
mortality, as the procedure involves craniotomy. A posterior canal occlusion via a mastoid operation will control the symptoms, but a SNHL may
complicate 5% of cases.

CHAPTER 14

The inner ear

Meniere’s disease/syndrome
Meniere’s disease presents as increasing fullness in the ear and roaring
tinnitus, with a sensation of blocked hearing, and episodic vertigo.
Alternatively, there may be a sudden onset of vertigo with no warning
(see Signs and symptoms, p. 304). Typically, 30%–50% of people with
Meniere’s disease have bilateral symptoms within 3 years of presentation.
Meniere’s disease occurs in 50–150 people per 100,000 of the population.
It is more common in females than in males and usually occurs between the
ages of 35 and 40 years.

Causes
-

Idiopathic Meniere’s disease
Post-traumatic head injury or ear surgery
Postinfectious delayed, e.g., in mumps and measles
Late-stage syphilis
Classical Cogan’s
Atypical Cogan’s

Signs and symptoms
Of people with Meniere’s disease.
- 42% have hearing loss alone
- 11% have vertigo alone
- 44% have vertigo and hearing loss
- 3% have tinnitus
Vertigo lasts more than 20 minutes and is associated with nausea, vomiting,
and autonomic effects. Most episodes last 2–4 hours (although some last
for more than 6 hours).
Horizontal or horizontorotatory nystagmus is always present. The patient
may experience disequilibrium after an attack for several days.
A fluctuating SNHL is found in the early stages of the disease. Later, the
hearing loss becomes permanent. The hearing may not change for some
days after an attack.
Types of hearing loss
- Low-frequency SNHL
- Flat, moderately severe SNHL
- Bilateral SNHL with >25 dB asymmetry
Poorly controlled patients have progressive hearing loss, stabilizing at
50–60 dB.

Variant presentations of Meniere’s disease
- Lemoyez variant—hearing improves with vertigo attacks
- Otolithic crisis of Tumarkin—patient has drop attacks with vertigo
(decompression of saccule)
- Cochlear Meniere’s—auditory symptoms only
- Vestibular Meniere’s—vestibular symptoms only

MENIERE’S DISEASE/SYNDROME 1

Investigations
There is no single diagnostic test.
- Otoneurological examination
- Pure tone audiogram
- MRI scan if there is asymmetry
- Autoantibodies—ESR, ANA, RhF, IgG
- Electrocochleography (ECoG)—this test involves placing a recording
electrode either in the EAC or through the tympanic membrane to
rest against the promontory of the cochlea. Sound is then applied to
the test ear and the electrical activity in the ear is documented. Several
components can be identified and measured. An increased ratio of the
summating potential compared to the action potential >0.4 suggests
hydrops (Fig. 14.12).

Pathology
On sectioning the inner ear in affected patients, the scala media is
expanded, as if there has been too much pressure in the endolymph.
This is known as endolymphatic hydrops.

CHAPTER 14

The inner ear

Treatment of Meniere’s disease
Medical management
- Prophylaxis—A low-salt diet is always recommended. A diuretic such
as triamterene/hydrochlorothiazide or acetazolomide is often
prescribed.
- For acute attacks of vertigo—Meclizine and promethazine are antihistamines and vestibular suppressants.
- Six-month review with symptom diary recording vertigo (spinning)
episodes and the length of each episode.

Surgical intervention
Patients whose symptoms are not improved by maximum medical therapy
will require active intervention.

Principles of intervention
All treatments balance the control of vertiginous episodes with the risk of
hearing loss and the associated morbidity of the procedure (see Table 14.3).
Treatment should not be undertaken for non-vertiginous symptoms.
Care should be undertaken when dealing with the better hearing ear.
Factors affecting the choice of intervention
- Patient choice
- Surgeon’s preference
- Cost of treatment
- Hearing level in affected ear
- Patient fitness
Measuring success
Guidelines from the American Academy of Otorhinolaryngologists and
Head and Neck Surgeons (AAOHNS) measure success as comparing the
number of vertiginous episodes in 6 months prior to treatment with the
number of episodes 6 months after treatment and followed up for 2 years.

CHAPTER 14

The inner ear

Vascular causes of inner ear
dysfunction
Vascular occlusion of the labyrinthine artery can cause the sudden onset
of vertigo and hearing loss. This occlusion leads to widespread necrosis
of membranous structures and labyrinthitis ossificans. The patient may
have a prior history of transient ischemic attacks (TIAs)—62% of TIA
patients have episodic vertigo. Compensation usually occurs in 4 –6 months.

Occlusion of anterior vestibular artery
This produces hearing loss and vertigo. As the posterior circulation
remains intact, the patient may simply present with a BPPV-like symptom
complex.

Recurrent vestibulopathy/vascular loop syndrome
Seven percent of patients with vertigo experience this syndrome. It is
believed to occur as a result of an abnormally placed blood vessel
impacting on the vestibular nerve in the internal auditory meatus.
Females with this syndrome outnumber males by a 2:1 ratio. The usual
age is 35–55 years old. Patients have usually had symptoms of episodic
vertigo for 3 years at presentation, with 80% having had episodic vertigo
within the previous year and 10% having BPPV. PTA high-frequency loss is
found in 50% of patients and a middle frequency loss in 20%. The resulting
histological abnormality is axonal loss and endoneurial fibrosis.

Investigations
-

Full neurotological examination
Spontaneous nystagmus
Nonclassical Dix Hall Pike test—no fatigue
Pure tone audiograms
MRI/MRA

Treatment
Treatment is with vestibular suppressants—perchlorperazine or meclizine
for vertigo. Also consider microvascular nerve decompression.

CHAPTER 15

The skull base

Overview
The skull base is a specialized area of clinical work. No other anatomical
region of the body involves such a complex proximity of neurovascular
structures. Because of the rich network of blood vessels and cranial
nerves, and the proximity to the brain and intracranial tissues, the surgeon must operate with tremendous care to avoid significant morbidity.
The otolaryngologist is actively involved in this area, often as part of a
team including a neurosurgeon or plastic or craniofacial surgeon.
Cranial-base surgery has evolved into a unique specialty of highly
trained physicians. The morbidity of surgical procedures in this area has
decreased secondary to improved techniques, enhanced pre- and intraoperative monitoring, and reconstructive efforts. Access to these difficult
areas has increased with the development of image guidance systems and
the ability to extend endoscopic sinus surgery approaches via the sphenoid
and ethmoid roof to the skull base.

CHAPTER 15

The skull base

Anatomic considerations
Skull base regions
See Fig. 15.1.
Anterior skull base
- It extends from the frontal bone, over the cribriform plate, fovea
ethmoidalis, and orbital roofs, to the greater wing of the sphenoid
bone.
- The olfactory nerve (CN I) passes through foramina within the
cribriform plate to the superior nasal cavity.
- The most common location of iatrogenic injury during ethmoidal
surgery is at the fovea ethmoidalis.
Middle skull base
- It extends from the greater wing and body of the sphenoid bone to the
petrous ridge of the temporal bone.
- Cranial nerves II through VI, the internal carotid and middle meningeal
arteries, and superior ophthalmic vein traverse through foramina.
- Inferior to the skull base lie the pterygopalatine, temporal, infratemporal, and post-styloid parapharyngeal spaces.
Posterior skull base
- This extends from the petrous ridge to the occipital bones.
- It contains foramina for the jugular vein, and cranial nerves VII
through XII.
- It includes the foramen magnum.
- It has grooves for the petrous, sigmoid, and transverse sinuses.

CHAPTER 15

The skull base

Acoustic neuroma
Acoustic neuromas are benign, slow-growing tumors derived from
Schwann cells. More appropriately termed vestibular schwannomas,
these tumors often originate from the vestibular nerve within the internal
auditory canal (IAC). Postmortem data suggest that this tumor may be
underdiagnosed. An acoustic neuroma may be found incidentally on MRI,
in part because of increased detection of small tumors. See Box 15.1 for
differential diagnosis of CPA angle tumors.
Acoustic neuromas account for 6%–8% of all intracranial neoplasms,
most of which are sporadic (95%). Five percent of them are genetic, as
part of the inherited condition of neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) on
chromosome 22, and arise bilaterally.

Presentation
The patient may experience some of the following:
- Asymmetric sudden SNHL, progressive high-frequency SNHL,
or tinnitus
- Vestibular symptoms—either disequilibrium or vertiginous episodes.
- Symptoms of raised intracranial pressure such as headache or visual
disturbance.
- Brainstem compression—incoordination or ataxia gait
- Hitselberger’s sign—postauricular numbness due to facial nerve
compression
- Reduced corneal reflex
- Unterberger’s test is positive—the patient marches on the spot with
the eyes closed. A positive test is a rotation to one side or the other.

Investigations
-

PTA, speech discrimination, acoustic reflex, and reflex decay
Auditory brainstem-evoked response (ABR)
Vestibular testing (ENG or posturography)
MRI scan with gadolinium contrast
Full otoneurological exam

Management
In weighing options for managing these tumors you must balance the
risks of hearing loss, facial nerve palsy, and surgical morbidity. There are
several possibilities:
- Observation—with serial MRI scans for slow-growing tumors
- Translabyrinthine approach—destroys the hearing but is a more direct
approach. Its advantages are a low risk to the facial nerve and the
ability to address larger tumor sizes.
- Middle fossa approach—technically challenging to work around the
facial nerve. For small tumors only. Its advantage is improved hearing
preservation.
- Retrosigmoid approach—good visualization, preserves the hearing,
most tumor sizes are treatable. There is a risk of air embolism.
- Stereotactic radiosurgery—multiplanar radiotherapy, useful in treating
small tumors in patients at risk for surgical resection. Its success is
determined by inhibition of tumor growth.

ACOUSTIC NEUROMA 1

Complications
- Any intracranial procedure, e.g., craniotomy—carries a 1% risk of
mortality
- Facial nerve palsy
- Total hearing loss
- CSF leak, meningitis, air embolism, intracranial hemorrhage

CHAPTER 15

The skull base

Glomus jugulare tumors
Glomus jugulare tumors are benign paragangliomas arising from neuroendocrine tissue (glomus bodies) within the jugular foramen.
Histologically, these tumors resemble paragangliomata of the carotid body,
promontory of the cochlea and adrenal medulla. Neurosecretory chief
cells are arranged in nests (zellballen) surrounded by fibrous trabeculae
and sustentacular cells. In contrast to secretory pheochromocytomas, only
1%–3% of glomus tumors secrete catecholamines and dopamine. Growth
usually occurs through foramina and air cells but can erode bone with
increasing size.

Presentation
- Asymptomatic until tumor reaches significant size
- Catecholamine excess, flushing, diarrhea, hypertension, headaches
- Compression of neurovascular structures within the jugular bulb may
cause neuropathies of CN IX–XI (Vernet syndrome: paralysis of the
ipsilateral soft palate, pharynx, and vocal fold).
- Petrous carotid extension may herald Horner syndrome.
- Extension to middle ear, pulsatile tinnitus, conductive hearing loss,
facial weakness
- Posterior fossa extension, ataxia, and gait disturbance

Investigation
Like paragangliomas of other head and neck regions, the diagnosis of
glomus jugulare tumors is facilitated through clinical exam and imaging
rather than biopsy. Diagnostic biopsy is generally contraindicated because
of the vascular nature of the tumors and poor accessibility.
Identification can be facilitated by the following:
- Cranial nerve and audiometric examinations
- CT scanning of temporal bone or neck with contrast delineates bony
landmarks and erosion.
- MRI T1-weighted images allow determination of soft tissue and intracranial extension. Gadolinium enhancement reveals characteristic “salt
and pepper” appearance of vascular channels.
- Angiography may be used to identify the vascular supply of tumor and
for embolization within 48 hours of planned surgical resection.
- Consider serum catecholamine and 24-hour urinary vanillylmandellic
acid and metanephrine.

Management
- Complete surgical resection is preferred.
- Staging assists in determination of the most appropriate approach.
- Transcervical, transmastoid, and transcranial approaches may be
necessary.
- Preoperative angiography with embolization 1–2 days prior
- A- and B-blockade preoperatively if tumor is secreting
- External beam radiotherapy is considered for nonsurgical candidates
but is not curative.
- Postsurgical rehabilitation for neuropathies

CHAPTER 15

The skull base

Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC)
Because of the proximity of the nasopharynx to the skull base and vital
structures, the invasive nature of tumor growth, and the difficulty of
examining the region, NPC generally has a poor prognosis. There are
three distinct types of nasopharyngeal carcinoma:
- Type I—keratinizing SCC. This type accounts for 25% of NPC in North
American cultures, and patients at risk are similar to those with SCC of
the head and neck in general.
- Type II—non-keratinizing SCC, least frequently encountered
- Type III—undifferentiated carcinoma (lymphoepithelioma). This is
more common in patients from southern China and Hong Kong. It is
associated with Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) and accounts for 60% of NPC
in North America. Staging schema is illustrated in Box 15.2.

Presentation
-

Lymph node metastasis
Nasal obstruction
Middle ear effusion
Epistaxis
Extensive tumors can involve the skull base and cause cranial nerve
palsies (CN V/VI early, III/IV with cavernous sinus extension, IX/X/XI
with jugular foramen involvement).

Investigations
- Thorough head and neck examination with flexible endoscopy
(see Fig. 15.2).
- Patients will be given a CT and/or an MRI scan.
- FNA of involved cervical neck nodes

Important
Every patient presenting with a unilateral middle ear effusion must have
their nasopharynx visualized to exclude NPC.

Treatment
- Primary treatment involves radiotherapy to the nasopharynx and
bilateral neck.
- Concurrent chemoradiation may improve disease-free survival in
patients with advanced disease.
- Neck dissection may be necessary if there are extensive lymph node
metastases.
- Surgical treatment of NPC primary is limited by poor exposure and
cranial nerve morbidity.

Prognosis
Overall prognosis is poor, with 5-year survival ranging from 30% to 57%.

CHAPTER 15

The skull base

Juvenile angiofibroma
This is a rare benign tumor seen almost exclusively in males. (If the patient
is female, consider chromosomal analysis.) It originates near the
sphenopalatine foramen at the lateral nasal wall. It may invade locally to
the pterygopalatine fossa, orbit, or intracranial region but is not malignant.
The histological architecture demonstrates multiple endothelial-lined
vascular channels within a fibrous connective tissue stroma. The feeding
vessels are often derived from the external carotid system, i.e., internal
maxillary artery, but may originate from the internal carotid artery.

Presentation
-

Recurrent epistaxis in young male (average age, 14 years)
Nasal obstruction
Unilateral middle ear effusion
Cheek swelling
Sinusitis
Large posterior nasal mass
Pulsatile mass palpated prior to adenoidectomy

Investigations
-

Clinical examination with endoscope
CT scan (bulging of the posterior maxillary sinus wall) and MRI
Angiography
Do not do a biopsy for fear of life-threatening hemorrhage

Management
- The primary treatment involves preoperative angiographic embolization
followed by surgical resection 48–72 hours later.
- There are several ways to gain access to the area, including medial
maxillectomy and transpalatal and midfacial degloving approaches.
- Complete resection of the tumor is facilitated by the increased
exposure gained by a combined approach, such as transpalatal and
midfacial degloving.
- In some cases, an endoscopic resection may be appropriate.

CHAPTER 15

The skull base

Sinonasal malignancy
This term describes a diverse group of malignant tumors affecting the
nose and sinus system. SCC accounts for 70% of sinonasal malignancy,
adenocarcinoma for 10%, and adenoid cystic carcinoma for 10%. The
remainder consists of soft tissue sarcomas, lymphoreticular tumors,
olfactory neuroblastoma, melanoma, and metastatic tumors. Because of
the inaccessibility of the region and lack of symptoms, early diagnosis is
uncommon.
Exposure to a number of industrial chemicals has been correlated with
sinonasal tumors. Nickel workers are at risk of developing SCC and
woodworkers are at risk for adenocarcinoma. Presentation is often
delayed for up to 20 years following exposure. See Box 15.3 for staging
guidelines. The overall prognosis is poor, with less than 50% of patients
surviving for 5 years.
Common sites for sinonasal malignancy are the following:
- Maxillary sinus
- Nasal cavity
- Ethmoid sinus

Presentation
Some or all of the following features may be seen:
- Nasal obstruction
- Epistaxis
- Sinusitis
- Maxillary symptoms
- Loose teeth
- Ulcer on palate
- Cheek swelling or hypoesthesia (infraorbital nerve involvement V2)
- Ethmoid symptoms
- Unilateral obstruction
- Diplopia, proptosis, chemosis
- Headache

Investigations
- CT and/or MRI
- Endoscopy and biopsy (see Fig. 15.3)
- FNA if cervical metastases

Treatment
Because of the advanced stage of disease at diagnosis, most tumors are
treated with combined surgical resection and radiotherapy. The location
and extent of disease dictate the extent and approach of surgery.
Localized tumors of the maxillary sinus require maxillectomy. An attempt
is made to preserve the orbit when possible. Advanced tumors of the
frontal, ethmoid, and sphenoid sinuses with involvement of the skull base
often require craniofacial resection with neurosurgery. Rehabilitation
following surgery may be improved with the use of prothodontics or flap
reconstruction.

CHAPTER 15

The skull base

Temporal bone fractures
Fractures of the temporal bone may occur following significant blunt or
penetrating trauma to the head. Etiologies include missile, thermal, blast,
foreign body, or blunt head injury. Fistfights, falls, motor vehicle, and
machinery accidents account for most cases. It is crucial to perform a
thorough initial evaluation (airway, breathing, circulation [ABC]) and rule
out coexistent trauma such as spinal, brain, thoracic, and abdominal
injury.
Classically, fractures have been described by the direction of the
fracture line along the petrous ridge (see Figs. 15.4 and 15.5). Longitudinal
fractures (80% of total) occur following temporal or parietal blows,
through foramina anterior to the ridge. Look for ruptured tympanic membrane (TM), hemotympanum, conductive hearing loss, and Battle’s sign
(mastoid ecchymosis). Transverse fractures (10% of total) occur from
frontal or occipital blows and cross the otic capsule or IAC, imparting
significant long-term morbidity. There is a higher incidence of facial-nerve
and cochleovestibular injury.

Presentation
-

TM laceration, EAC fracture or laceration, mastoid ecchymosis

Investigations
-

Otoscopic evaluation
Cranial nerve exam
High-resolution CT temporal bone
Tuning fork evaluation or complete audiometry
B2-transferrin assay for ear fluid (if applicable)
ENoG for facial nerve integrity (if applicable)

Management
- Establish adequate airway, ensure respiration, and assess circulation.
- Conductive hearing loss may resolve if due to TM trauma or hemotympanum. If persistent at 3 months, consider tympanotomy to assess
for sclerosis, ossicular discontinuity, and acquired cholesteatoma.
- Vertigo generally resolves by 6 months, with return of ENG to normal.
Acute treatment involves meclizine, promethazine, and diazepam. If it
persists, consider a perilymphatic fistula and recommend bed rest,
elevation of the head, stool softeners, and antitussives. Surgical repair
of the fistula is required if refractory.
- Facial nerve injury should be assessed with ENoG. If there is >90%
degeneration within 2 weeks, recommend facial nerve decompression.
If delayed-onset or incomplete paralysis occurs, consider observation
plus steroids.

TEMPORAL BONE FRACTURES 1

- CSF otorrhea may resolve within 2 weeks in most cases with bed rest,
head elevation, stool softeners, and lumbar drainage. If it persists, dural
repair may be necessary.
- IV antibiotics are indicated if otitis media or meningitis occurs.

CHAPTER 15

The skull base

Complications of surgery
The skull base is an anatomic region of significant complexity through
which structures from the brain pass downward to the face and neck and
vice versa. The surgeon must have not only a profound understanding
of the structural anatomy but also an appreciation for the physiologic and
metabolic functions controlled by the region. Improvements in both surgical technique and intraoperative monitoring have reduced the incidence of
major surgical morbidity in the region.
Complications of skull base surgery include the following:
- Cranial nerve injury: cranial nerves I–XII are at risk, depending on
surgical region
- Vascular complications:
- Carotid or jugular rupture
- Vertebral artery rupture
- Venous thrombosis or thromboembolus
- Infarction
- Air embolus
- Cerebral complications
- Brain edema or herniation
- Meningitis, intracranial abscess
- Venous sinus thrombosis
- Seizures
- CSF leak
- Metabolic alterations: syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone
secretion (SIADH) or diabetes insipidus

CHAPTER 16

Facial plastic surgery and reconstruction

Principles of reconstruction
Head and neck surgery can have devastating functional and cosmetic
consequences. Resection of portions of the tongue, palate, pharynx, and
larynx can result in severe problems with respiration, deglutination and
phonation. Transfacial and transmandibular approaches can result in
disfiguring scars as well as impaired function. The basic principles of
reconstruction are to restore basic function and physiology, preserve
cosmetic subunits, and minimize disfigurement. This can be accomplished
in a variety of ways, including the deliberate placement of scars along
natural skin creases or along cosmetic subunit boundaries, the restoration of bulk with tissue and filling agents, and sometimes selective facial
chemodenervation and reinnervation.

The reconstructive ladder
The reconstructive ladder (Table 16.1) refers to a stepwise approach for
the assessment of tissue reconstruction, from the simplest and least
invasive to the most invasive and complicated. At the bottom of the
ladder is healing by secondary intention, whereas at the top is free flap
reconstruction. The approach must be evaluated by considering the
functional and cosmetic outcomes of each approach, balanced by the
severity of each procedure. Donor site morbidity, patient general medical
condition and age, and need for further surgery may all affect the reconstructive algorithm. Reconstruction may also involve the use of obturators
and prosthetics. With greater expertise and safety of free flaps, there are
many advocates of an escalated reconstruction approach with more
aggressive reconstructions for smaller defects.

PRINCIPLES OF RECONSTRUCTION 1

Wound healing
Steps in wound healing
- Step 1: The inflammatory cascade. The break in epithelium and soft
tissue damage release inflammatory mediators that activate and recruit
fibroblasts. Fibroblasts are activated and begin to migrate into the
wound.
- Step 2: The proliferative phase. The fibroblasts produce ground substances (collagen and components of the extracellular matrix) and lay
the foundation for epithelial migration and angiogenesis.
- Step 3: The remodeling phase. The collagen and ground substance
reorganize to form scar tissue.

329

330

CHAPTER 16

Facial plastic surgery and reconstruction

Scar revision
Scar revision is based on the excision and redirection of badly healed or
badly placed scars into less conspicuous areas. This can be accomplished
in several manners; placing scars into natural skin creases, into the margins
of cosmetic subunits, and into natural facial shadows. Linear scars tend to
be more conspicuous than irregular scars. The most pronounced scars are
straight or linear scars that cross multiple subunits, and are perpendicular
to natural skin creases. See Figs. 16.1 and 16.2 for common techniques of
revising scar.

Relaxed skin tension lines (RSTL)
Skin elasticity is different based on the direction of tension. The RSTLs
are the lines of minimal tension of the skin. Incisions should be made
parallel to these lines. The lines of maximal extensibility (LME) are perpendicular to the RSTLs. The least skin tension is across the LMEs and
will ultimately result in the thinnest scar.

Z-plasty
This is a bilateral transposition and rotational flap that can lengthen,
redirect, and reposition scars. Z-plasty is used to reposition scars along
RSTLs and to lengthen contracted scars. The angle of the limbs of the Z
corresponds to the degree of length added. A 30* angle results in a 25%
gain, a 45* angle results in the addition of 50% of length, and 60* angle
results in a 75% gain.

M-plasty
The M-plasty is a modification of an elliptical excision with a wedge cut
out at each edge. This reduces the length of the scar.

W-plasty and geometric broken line
These techniques are used in an attempt to camouflage linear scars.
The original scar is excised and the edges are made into a pattern. A Wshaped pattern is used for W-plasty whereas the geometric broken-line
technique uses an irregular pattern.

CHAPTER 16

Facial plastic surgery and reconstruction

Common local and regional flaps
Local flaps have a random blood supply, predominantly from the dermal
and subdermal plexus, which are fed by musculocutaneous vessels. In the
head and neck, these flaps are quite reliable because of the rich vascular
supply of the face. Axial pattern flaps require a consistent superficial
blood supply along the length of the flap. These types of flaps are used
for reconstruction after skin cancer surgery such as Mohs surgery.

Advancement flaps
In this type of flap linear movement is used to close defects. Examples of
advancement type flaps are V-to-Y and bilateral advancement flaps.
These are useful around the forehead.

Rotational flaps
This type of flap rotates a flap of tissue into the defect. The incision is a
semicircle and requires extensive undermining. The advancement to fill
the tissue defect is along the arc of rotation.

Transposition flaps
This type of flap requires tissue elevation and undermining, and the tissue
is rotated into the defect, leaving another defect that needs to be closed.
Z-plasty, rhomboid flaps, and bilobed flaps are examples of transposition
flaps.

Interpolated flaps
These are flaps that use tissue that is elevated with a pedicle and is
brought over intact skin bridge. These flaps usually require an axial or
named blood supply. An example is the paramedian forehead flap (See
Fig. 16.3).

Local flaps
There are many variations of advancement, rotation, and transposition
flaps that are used in combinations for reconstruction. There are often
multiple types of flaps that can be used for the same defect; the choice is
individually tailored for the patient and determined by the surgeon’s
experience. Table 16.2, and Figs. 16.2 and 16.4 show several examples and
illustrations of commonly used superficial skin flaps in the head and neck.

Pedicled flaps
Pedicled flaps draw nutrition from a large and reliable vascular supply
that is usually an axial and named vessel (see Table 16.3). Dissection is
performed to carefully preserve this blood supply. The advantage is that
the tissue can provide its own vasculature into the tissue defect.

CHAPTER 16

Facial plastic surgery and reconstruction

Free flaps
Microvascular free tissue transfer or free flaps have greatly expanded the
capacity for large tissue defect reconstruction. Free tissue is harvested
with its blood supply and transferred to the reconstruction site with
anastomosis of the arterial and venous supply. Numerous types of donor
flaps are available and the list continues to expand. Several of the more
common flaps used for head and neck reconstruction are described here.
Flap composition (muscle, fascia, mucosa, skin, nerve, soft tissue, fat),
donor site morbidity, length of the pedicle, viability and ease of the flap,
and ability to harvest the flap during extirpation surgery are all important
factors to consider. These operations are among the lengthiest and most
complicated in surgery, and flap care and management require diligent
and careful surveillance.

Preoperative assessment
Adequate vascular supply from the donor site is assessed. An Allen test
may be sufficient for evaluation of the vascular supply for a radial forearm
free flap, while an MRA or angiogram may be necessary for fibular freeflap evaluation in a patient with vascular disease. Choice of flap is determined by the amount and composition of tissue needed and donor site
availability.

Postoperative care
Postoperative care of the patient involves maintaining a euvolemic or
slightly hypervolemic state and strict control of blood pressure, especially
avoiding hypotension, and preventing hypothermia. Postoperative care of
the flap involves frequent checks for flap viability and blood supply. Flap
monitoring can be done by direct physical examination of the flap, such
as observation for bleeding by pinprick or the wound edges and capillary
refill. Doppler signals directly over the vascular pedicle and flap temperature are also regularly checked. All of these techniques are used to
evaluate flap perfusion. Arterial insufficiency is characterized by a cool,
pale appearance and prolonged capillary refill. In vascular insufficiency the
flap appears congested and blue, and there is brisk capillary refill along
with dark venous blood with pinprick. If there is evidence of anastomotic
disruption, surgical exploration should be performed immediately.
The success of free tissue transfer is between 95% and 98%. Problems
with the venous system of the flap occur more frequently than those
with arterial anastomosis. Most thromboses occur within the first 3 days
postoperatively. If there is evidence of flap failure, flap survival depends
on the duration of ischemic time before correction. There is a no reflow
phenomenon that occurs after a certain ischemic time has elapsed secondary to failure of the microvascular system. Flap salvage rates are between
69% and 100%.

Radial forearm free flap
The radial forearm free flap is one of the most common flaps used in
head and neck reconstruction. It is composed primarily of fascia and skin;
however, bone and sensory nerve can also be incorporated. The pedicle

FREE FLAPS 1

consists of the radial artery and two venae comitantes. The flap is harvested
from the medial surface of the forearm.
The radial forearm free flap has multiple advantages. The vascular
pedicle is long, reliable, and readily harvested. It is thin and pliable tissue
that can be adapted to a wide variety of different reconstructive needs.
The flap can be made sensate by including the medial and lateral antebrachial nerves. The lateral cortex of the distal radius can also be used
for bony reconstruction. However, the bone is monocortical and of
limited use, as it is quite thin and prone to fracture.
The main drawbacks for the radial forearm free flap involve donor site
morbidity. The Allen test is performed preoperatively by checking the
perfusion of the hand after digital pressure occlusion of the radial and
ulnar arteries. Even with a normal Allen test, however, there is a chance
of vascular insufficiency to the hand after removal of the radial artery.
In addition, the donor site needs to be covered with a skin graft, which is
usually harvested from the thigh.

Fibula free flap
The workhorse for reconstruction of large bony defects is the fibula
osteocutaneous free flap. It is excellent for reconstructing mandible and
other defects requiring strong, stable bony support. The skin island and
accompanying soft tissue are somewhat small and the blood supply to
this area is not as robust. The blood supply is based on the peroneal
artery, which is a branch of the posterior tibial artery. There is a sensory
potential for transfer as well with the lateral sural cutaneous nerve.
A disadvantage of the fibular free flap is variable blood supply and
potential donor site morbidity. Patients with peripheral vascular disease
are at higher risk for developing ischemic problems with the foot.
An intact posterior tibial pulse and dorsal pedalis pulse usually indicate
good blood supply. However, vascular studies are commonly performed.
An ankle–brachial index of <1 suggests that further study with an arteriogram, duplex, or MRA may be necessary.

Lateral thigh free flap
The lateral thigh free flap is composed of fascia and skin. The blood
supply is based on the cutaneous perforators of the deep femoral artery,
which originates off the femoral artery. The mass of soft tissue available
for harvest can be highly variable depending on body habitus. This soft
tissue flap can be used for a wide variety of head and neck reconstructions. In terms of tissue bulk, it is intermediate between the radial forearm
and the rectus flaps. Sensory nerve harvest of the lateral femoral cutaneous
nerve can also be performed.

Rectus free flap
The rectus myocutaneous free flap is composed of muscle, fascia, fat, and
skin. It is substantial flap used to provide bulk for many different types of
reconstructions. In the head and neck it can be used for oral cavity, soft
tissue, and skull base reconstruction. The blood supply to the pedicle is
generally from the deep inferior epigastric vessels, although there is also
secondary supply from the deep superior epigastric arteries.

339

340

CHAPTER 16

Facial plastic surgery and reconstruction

The main advantage of the rectus free flap is its bulk and long vascular
pedicle. Because the donor site is away from the head and neck a twoteam approach for flap harvest and tumor extirpation can be performed.
The most common complications at the donor site include hernias,
wound dehiscence, and infection.

Jejunal
The free jejunal flap is composed of a portion of small intestine between
the duodenum and the ligament of Treitz. The blood supply is from the
jejunal arteries and the associated mesenteric vascular arcades. It is used
for reconstruction of mucosal defects within the pharynx or esophagus.
Unlike all the other muscular and soft tissue free flaps, the jejunum has
peristaltic action. Monitoring of the flap is usually performed by isolating
a small segment of the bowel and placing it outside the neck closure.

Principles of aesthetic examination
Beauty is in the eye of the beholder. Because cultural and individual
aesthetic sensibility varies, attempts have been made to establish normative values for facial aesthetics, as well as formulas and algorithms to
assess and quantify beauty. However, variability is common, and what is a
satisfactory outcome for the surgeon may be far from desirable to the
patient. Communication and presurgical counseling are paramount prior
to any cosmetic undertaking. The use of facial morphing computer programs
may help establish realistic goals and expectations. Individual surgeons
often have their own sense of aesthetics which are passed on to their
treatments.
Generally, an aesthetically pleasing face is smooth, symmetric, proportioned, and balanced. Almost everyone has inherent asymmetries that can
be discerned with careful analysis. These asymmetries should be pointed
out to patients during preoperative counseling because they may become
more obvious after the procedure. Skin texture and facial contour are also
important, and initially, less invasive options should be advocated before
discussing surgery.

Facial landmarks
The external facial landmarks of the face are illustrated in Fig. 16.5 and
listed below (Table 16.4) from superior to inferior. Soft tissue landmarks
are determined by facial appearance and can be garnered from facial
photographs. Bony landmarks are determined by palpation during the
physical examination.

Facial thirds and fifths
Ideal facial proportions have been the source of debate and scrutiny.
Generally, ideal proportions divide the face vertically into thirds and
horizontally into fifths. The thirds are from the hairline (trichion) to the
glabella, glabella to subnasale, and subnasale to menton. See Figs. 16.6a
and b. In the vertical dimension, the width of the eyes, the nose, and
distance from the lateral canthus to the lateral projection of the ear are
approximately equal.
The Golden ratio is a mathematical proportion equal to 1:1.618 (or also
5:8) that is said to have intrinsic harmony. The Golden ratio was celebrated by ancient Greeks and Egyptians and even Leonardo da Vinci as an
ideal proportion for beauty. There are several examples of the golden
proportion in the face, including the ratio of the length to width of the
human head and the ratio of the upper face to mid-face.

Facial and nasal angles
There have been many methods and algorithms that define the ideal
facial angles (see Table 16.5 and Fig. 16.7). The nasafrontal and nasolabial
angles are two examples of guidelines that are used frequently during
facial analysis.
Table 16.5 Facial and nasal angles
Dorsal line

Line passing through the nasion to the nasal tip

Nasofrontal angle

Angle formed by the line created by the dorsal line of
the nose and the line from the nasion to glabella.
In men the ideal angle is approximately 115* while in
women it is slightly greater, at 120* to 135*.

Nasofacial angle

Incline of the nasal dorsum to the plane of the face;
30* to 40*

Nasolabial

Angles of the lines created by the border of the upper
lip and the subnasale and between the subnasale and
the columella. The ideal angle in men is approximately
90* and increased in women at 100*–105*. This is
reflected by the slightly upturned or rotated
appearance in female noses.

Facial plastic surgery and reconstruction

Photography
Facial photos for aesthetic facial surgery are taken in a standardized and
consistent manner. Generally, the facial views are taken with the Frankfort horizontal as the plane of reference. The Frankfort horizontal plane
extends from the superior border of the external auditory canal (corresponds to the superior tragus) to the infraorbital rim. Photography for
rhinoplasty generally includes frontal, base, lateral, and oblique views.

Rhinoplasty
The nose is at the center of the face and is the focal point. Because it is
in the center, the nose sets off many of the other facial features including
lips, eyes, cheeks, chin, and forehead. On profile, the nose is the most
prominent feature. One of the complexities of rhinoplasty is deciding
how an aesthetically harmonious nose can be achieved within the framework of an individual’s other features. For instance, increasing nasal projection will soften the features of the chin. A short, rotated nose may
look very good in a short individual but inappropriate in someone tall.
A cookbook approach to rhinoplasty will ultimately result in unhappy
patients.

Nasal anatomy
There are specific terms to describe the different regions of the nose
(see Table 16.6). The nose is divided into thirds. The upper third is primarily nasal bone and articulates with the frontal bone. The nasofrontal
suture is the groove formed by this articulation and represents the nasion.
The region where the upper lateral cartilages overlap with the nasal bones
is referred to as the keystone area.
The middle third is composed of the upper lateral cartilages. The upper
lateral cartilages are shaped like airplane wings and are attached firmly to
the nasal bones. At the caudal edge, they form an interlocking s with the
lower lateral cartilages in a region known as the “scroll.”
The lower third is composed of the pair of lower lateral cartilages.
The lower lateral, or alar, cartilage is shaped like a horseshoe and is
divided for reference into three regions: the medial crura, the middle or
intermediate crura, and the lateral crura. The structure of the lower
lateral cartilages and their attachments to the septum and upper lateral
cartilages are the basis for nasal tip support. The internal and external
nasal valve areas rely greatly on the cartilaginous support and structure.

Aesthetic assessment
The nose should be approximately one-third the vertical length of the
face, beginning at the glabella to subnasale. The width and length should
be approximately 0.6 (remember the golden ratio). The width of the
nose at the alar base should be approximately the width of the eyes.

Cottle maneuvers.

External nasal valve

Area formed by the medial and lateral crus of the alar
cartilages and nasal floor. Also an area of narrowing.
This area is tested by Cottle maneuvers.

Functional assessment
Functional assessment of the nose refers to the ability of the nose to
carry and humidify air. Assessment includes the stability of the nasal tip
and nasal valves as well as the septum and characteristic of the nasal
mucosa. Clinical evaluation for allergies, sinusitis, olfaction, and tear
production may be considered. Cottle maneuvers should be performed
to assess valve stability and relative contribution to nasal obstruction.

Techniques
There are many different ways to address nasal deformities for aesthetic
evaluation, with various techniques available for addressing deformities of
the upper, middle, and lower nasal vaults. The tip can be addressed with
an external (open) approach or an endonasal (closed) approach. The open
approach allows for direct visualization of the lower lateral cartilages
with improved precision and easier assessment for symmetry. An endonasal approach spares the patient an incision across the columella and
there is less dissection, resulting in less postoperative swelling. A cartilage
delivery method is an endonasal approach that externalizes the lower
lateral cartilages. The lower lateral cartilages and nasal tip are altered by
shaping and contouring the cartilage and by adding cartilage grafts. Batten
grafts are cartilage grafts used to provide additional stability to the intermediate and lateral crura and provide improved stability at the nasal
valve. Columellar grafts can be placed to add stability to the nasal tip and

349

350

CHAPTER 16

Facial plastic surgery and reconstruction

alter rotation. Tip grafts can increase nasal projection and alter the
appearance of the domes.
The dorsum is composed of both the middle and upper thirds of the
nose. There is both cartilage and bone that comprise the dorsum, which
need to be addressed separately. Dorsal humps are addressed by resecting cartilage and rasping bone. The middle third can be widened or narrowed by altering the shape of the upper lateral cartilages and by inserting
cartilage grafts. Spreader grafts can widen the middle third of the nasal
valve. The upper third is generally addressed with osteotomies to correct
asymmetries, remove humps, and alter the width.

Complications
Rhinoplasty has several risks. The most common complications are those
associated with any surgical procedure, such as bleeding, infection, and
unsightly scarring. The unforeseen outcome and/or displeasing aesthetic
result is always a possibility and is one reason why patient selection and
preoperative counseling are crucial. The surgical approach for rhinoplasty
will destabilize the nasal support that needs to be reestablished. There
are a variety of named postsurgical deformities, including Polly beak
deformity, open roof, pinched nasal appearance, rocker deformity, alar
retraction, and columellar show. Valve collapse, vestibular stenosis, and
nasal tip instability can result in nasal congestion. Careful preoperative
planning and precise surgical technique can minimize these complications.

CHAPTER 16

Facial plastic surgery and reconstruction

Rhytidectomy
Treatment of the aging face involves several different approaches. Among
the most invasive but most dramatic are operations designed to restore a
youthful facial contour and remove excess skin laxity. Rhytidectomy
encompasses a group of procedures to reduce facial wrinkles, including
neck lift, face lift, and brow lift. Blepharoplasty can also be included and
there are numerous modifications in and variations of these procedures.

Anatomy
Fundamental knowledge preceding any discussion of rhytidectomy
includes the anatomy and relationships of the skin and fascial tissues
within the face and neck. Assessment of the overlying skin for skin damage
and photoaging is important. The amount of adipose tissue within the
subcutaneous layer will also affect outcome.
The superficial muscular aponeurotic system (SMAS) is a deep fascial
layer that envelopes the facial musculature. The SMAS is contiguous with
the platysma muscle in the neck and the galea in the forehead. This layer
encompasses the superficial temporal fascia as well as the muscles
around the mouth and nose and the eyes. Deep to the SMAS lie the
parotid fascia, facial nerve, and facial artery. An understanding of this
layer is necessary to use deeper planes of dissection for face-lifting,
resulting in a more dramatic and longer-lasting operation.
During rhytidectomy, branches of the facial nerve are at risk for damage.
Notably, the temporal branch, the zygomatic branch, and the marginal
branch may be encountered during dissection along the SMAS.

Assessment
As with any cosmetic procedure, careful patient selection and preoperative assessment are critical. Rhytidectomy is very good at treating the loss
of elasticity in the jowls and lower face and excess laxity of the plastysma
and fat of the cervical, submental, and submandibular areas. Strong skeletal support and cheek bones tend to favor a good cosmetic outcome.
A low-lying hyoid bone will limit the degree of restoration in the neck, as
will low-lying submandibular glands.

Types and techniques
Rhytidectomy techniques generally vary depending on the depth of
dissection and treatment of the fascial layers. The three general categories
of rhytidectomy include the superficial skin lift, the deep plane face-lift,
which involves suturing or plication of the SMAS, and even deeper facelifts,
which involve multiple fascial approaches and a subperiosteal dissection.

RHYTIDECTOMY 1

Complications
There are several complications associated with rhytidectomy. The most
common are those associated with any surgical procedure—namely,
scarring, bleeding, and infection. Other complications include nerve
damage. The greater auricular nerve, which provides sensation to the
lateral upper neck, lateral face, and ear, is the most commonly injured
nerve. There is an approximately 6% rate of injury. The rate of injuries to
the motor branches of the facial nerve is approximately 2% to 5%.

353

CHAPTER 16

Facial plastic surgery and reconstruction

Skin resurfacing
There are a variety of effective techniques that can improve skin texture
and tone. Mechanical, chemical, and laser- and light-based therapies can
eliminate the effects of photodamage and promote neocollagenesis.
Skin conditions that can be treated effectively include acne scars, wrinkles,
skin discoloration from chronic sun damage, actinic keratoses, scars, and
rhinophyma resulting from long-standing rosacea.

Fitzpatrick skin type classification
The Fitzpatrick skin type classification (Table 16.7) is used to grade skin
on the basis of response to sun and coloration. The skin type helps predict healing pattern and reactions to inflammation. This is particularly
important when determining reaction to dermabrasion, scarring, and
laser skin surgery. Darker skin types tend to hyperpigment with inflammation. Laser resurfacing procedures that are safe in pale or white skin
may have higher chances of scarring and crusting with darker skin. There
are greater risks for hypopigmentation as well with darker skin types.
Table 16.7 Fitzpatrick skin types
Type 1

Pale skin, always burns and never tans

Type 2

White skin, usually burns and tans with difficulty

Type 3

Average tan and sometimes burns

Type 4

Brown or olive skin, tans easily and rarely burns

Type 5

Dark brown skin, always tans, almost never burns

Type 6

Black skin, never burns, always tans

Dermabrasian
Dermabrasion is a mechanical means of removing the epidermis and the
papillary dermis. With the use of a rotating wire brush or diamond fraise
applied to chilled or tumesced skin, dermabrasion can successfully promote
re-epithelialization and reorganize collagen, thereby improving sundamaged skin. Patients are usually placed on topical tertinoin 0.05% for
several weeks prior to treatment. Occlusive dressings may be used after
treatment to accelerate wound healing.
Complications of dermabrasion include risk of skin infection, milia,
acne flares in people prone to acne, prolonged erythema, and hyper- or
hypopigmentation.

Chemical peels
Application of chemical peels is a technique in which a chemical exfoliant
is applied to the skin to induce cell turnover and improve skin discoloration and rhytides. Various strengths of acidic and basic chemical agents can
produce regenerative changes at superficial to deep levels of the epidermis
and dermis. Removal of the stratum corneum (the most superficial layer of
the epidermis) is considered a light superficial peel. Destruction of the

SKIN RESURFACING 1

epidermis is considered a superficial peel and induces epithelial exfoliation
and regeneration. Examples of superficial peels include tricholoracetic acid
(TCA) 10%–20%, Jessner’s solution (a combination of resorcinol, salicylic
acid, lactic acid), glycolic acid, salicylic acid (beta-hydroxy), and tretinoin.
Peels that cause additional inflammation within the papillary dermis are
considered a medium-depth peel. Examples of medium-depth peels
include Jessner’s solution, 70% glycolic acid, and solid carbon dioxide with
35% TCA.
Inflammation involving the reticular dermis is considered a deep
chemical peel. Examples of deep chemical peels include TCA above 50%
or the Gordon-Baker phenol peel. The deeper the peel, the greater the
chance for scarring, especially with TCA above 45%. Re-epithelialization
typically occurs in 7–10 days in medium and deep peels.
Complications of chemical peels include scarring, prolonged erythema,
skin infections, and skin discoloration.

Laser resurfacing
Laser resurfacing involves the use of either a pulsed laser system (usually
CO2 or erbium-YAG (yttrium aluminum garnet) laser for skin ablation.
The ultra-pulsed CO2 laser system (wavelength of 10,600 nm) with a
1000 microsecond pulse duration was one of the first described systems
to be used successfully for skin rejuvenation. Multiple CO2 laser systems
are available with a 900–1000 microsecond pulse duration and a computerized scanner to enable systematic treatment of a larger surface area.
The erbium-YAG laser (wavelength 2940 nm) produces a more superficial ablation than that of the CO2 laser system, with less recovery time
after treatment.
Another ablative modality that has become available is the use of
plasma energy created by highly excited nitrogen gas generated by radiofrequency. Energy levels can vary from less to more ablation depending
on the desired result.
Complications from these ablative devices that involve destruction of
the superficial skin include skin infection, scarring, prolonged erythema,
and hyper- or hypopigmentation.
A recent innovation in the field of laser- and light-based technologies is
the concept of fractional resurfacing. Rather than destroying the entire
surface of the skin, fractional devices create discrete zones of thermal
injury in between intact skin. By leaving islands of normal skin in between
wounded skin, rapid re-epithelializatin can occur as early as 24 hours
after the procedure. This technique appeals to patients seeking skin
rejuvenation who don’t want the long recovery period associated with
full skin resurfacing. There appear to be fewer side effects associated
with this relatively new procedure, as no scarring or long-term hyper- or
hypopigmentation has been reported. Erythema typically lasts for 3–4 days
after treatment.

Botulinum toxin injections
Botulinum toxin injection for facial rejuvenation is the most common
cosmetic procedure performed in the United States. The technique has
evolved since its initial applications and is often combined with injectable
fillers and laser procedures for optimal facial enhancement. The FDA has
approved the cosmetic use of botulinum toxin for the treatment of
hyperactive facial lines of the upper face and glabella. Practitioners have
used chemical denervation with botulinum toxin for other hyperspastic
muscle disorders, autononomic conditions such as hyperhidrosis and
drooling, and restoration of facial symmetry for patients with facial synkinesis. There is a growing body of knowledge on the utility of botulinum
toxin in the treatment of chronic pain disorders such as headaches and
temporomandibular disorders.
Botulinum type A is currently available in the United States as Botox
and Reloxin. Botulinum type B is available in the United States as Myobloc.
Botox has been FDA approved for the “temporary improvement in the
appearance of moderate to severe glabellar lines in adult men and women
65 or younger” since 2002, but its off-label usage is widespread. Reloxin is
currently undergoing clinical trials for FDA approval.
The most common cosmetic indications for botulinum toxin include
treating the dynamic lines of the upper third of the face such as the
glabellar brow furrow, the horizontal frontalis forehead lines, and the
periocular crow’s feet lines. Other applications of botulinum toxin injections include those to the lower face for perioral rhytides, platysmal banding in the neck, marrionette lines from depressed corners of the mouth,
and the “peau d’orange” wrinkling of the chin.

Mechanisms
In 1944, botulinum toxin A was purified in crystalline form, and in the
1950s the mechanism of action was elucidated. By blocking acetylcholine
release from motor neurons at the neuromuscular junction, botulinum
toxin A enters nerves via protein receptors. The SNARE protein complex is cleaved to inhibit exoctyosis of various neurotransmitters such as
acetylcholine. Botulinum toxin A cleaves SNAP-25 whereas type B
cleaves vesicle-associated membrane protein (VAMP), also known as
synaptobrevin. This process results in an inability to carry out neurotransmitter exocytosis. At the neuromuscular junction, a temporary
chemical denervation occurs.
In the early 1970s, botulinum toxin was proposed as a useful agent for
treating human strabismus. In 1987, while treating a patient for bepharospasm, a smoothening effect on the glabellar brow furrow was observed.
The first description of the cosmetic use of botulinum toxin was published
in 1992.

Techniques
The lyophilized powder is usually reconstituted with 1–4.0 ml normal
saline, depending on the desired concentration. When 1 ml normal saline
is used, the concentration is 100 units/ml. With 2.5 ml normal saline, the
final concentration is 40 units/ml. Men usually require more units than
women. The common areas of treatment are described in Fig. 16.8.

BOTULINUM TOXIN INJECTIONS 1

The glabellar brow furrow can be effectively treated with 20–25 units of
Botox, typically placed along five injection points to treat the corrugators
and procerus muscle. Four injections are placed on the medial aspect of
the brow into the corrugator muscles. Care must be taken to always stay
at least 1 cm above the orbital rim along the mid-papillary line to avoid
eyelid ptosis. It is helpful to have the patient frown just prior to injection
to visualize the corrugators. The fifth injection is placed along the midline
of the procerus.
Horizontal forehead lines can be diminished by treating the frontalis.
Twelve to 20 units of Botox are usually placed in five to seven divided
doses along the forehead. One should try not to inject too inferiorly to
avoid causing brow ptosis.
Fine lines in the periorbital region, called “crow’s feet,” can be diminished
with injections of botulinum toxin placed approximately 1 cm lateral to
the lateral canthus. A total of 12–15 units on each side is usually injected,
divided into three doses. Two to three units may also be injected just
below each eye.
For perioral rhytides or smoker’s lines, 5–10 units divided into four
injections along the orbicularis oris can be administered. Patients should
be warned that they may have difficulty with certain actions such as
sipping straws or whistling or saying particular sounds.

CHAPTER 17

Common operations

Obtaining informed consent
General principles
The following principles serve as a guideline for the consent process:
- Patients must be given sufficient information—in a way that they can
understand—to enable them to exercise their right to make informed
decisions about their care.
- Patients’ rights are protected by law.
- Effective communication is the key to informed consent.

Consent to investigation and treatment
A doctor who is undertaking a procedure or investigation will need to
obtain consent from the patient. When this is not possible, consent can
be obtained by a nominated person who is suitably trained and qualified,
who understands the risks involved, and who has sufficient knowledge of
the proposed investigation or treatment.
It is important that patients make their own decisions about treatment.
Ensuring voluntary decision making involves giving the patient a balanced
view of the options and explaining the need for informed consent.

Forms of consent
Consent can be either express or implied consent.
Express consent pertains to written or verbally communicated consent in
an informed fashion. It must be obtained and documented in the notes
when
- the treatment or procedure is complex, or involves significant risks
and/or adverse effects;
- there may be significant consequences for the patient’s employment or
social or personal life;
- the treatment is part of a research program.
Implied consent pertains to consent which is inferred from the patient’s
actions or other circumstances, even though not expressed in writing.
This may include procedures such as an ear examination or in situations
where the patient is unconscious, advanced directives or relatives are not
found, and life-saving treatment is felt to be in the patient’s best interest.

Reviewing consent
Previously obtained consent must be reviewed especially when
- significant time has elapsed between obtaining consent and the start of
treatment;
- there have been material changes in the patient’s condition, or in any
aspects of the proposed treatment plan, which might invalidate the
patient’s existing consent;
- new, potentially relevant information has become available about the
risks of the treatment, for example, or about other treatment options.

PRESENTING INFORMATION TO PATIENTS 1

Presenting information to patients
Box 17.1 outlines key elements of the informed consent process.

Box 17.1 Informed consent process
- Explain the nature of the decision and procedure.
- Discuss the risks and benefits and uncertainties of the planned
procedure.
- Provide reasonable alternatives to the procedure, including the
option not to treat.
- Ensure that the patient understands the discussion.
- Document the acceptance by the patient for the procedure.
- Give details of the diagnosis and prognosis, including the likely
prognosis if the condition is left untreated.
- Answer questions honestly, accurately, and objectively.
- State the purpose of the proposed investigation or treatment, and
details of the procedures or therapies involved, including subsidiary
treatment such as methods of pain relief.
- Explain the likely benefits and probabilities of success for each option;
discuss any serious or frequently occurring risks, including any lifestyle
changes that may be necessary as a result of the treatment.
- State how and when the patient’s condition and any side effects will be
monitored or reassessed.
- Give the name of the doctor who will have overall responsibility for
the treatment and, where appropriate, give the names of the senior
members of his or her team.
- Remind patients that they can change their mind about a decision at
any time and that they have a right to seek a second opinion.
- Where possible, use up-to-date written material and visual and other
aids to explain complex aspects of investigation, diagnosis, or
treatment.
- Make arrangements to meet particular language and communication
needs wherever possible. This could involve translations, independent
interpreters, signers, or the patient’s representative.
- Be considerate when giving distressing information. Give patients
information about counseling services and patient support groups.
- Allow patients sufficient time to reflect on their condition and
treatment, before and after making a decision, especially when the
information is complex or the risks are serious.

361

362

CHAPTER 17

Common operations

Establishing capacity to make
decisions
Fluctuating capacity
Patients who have difficulty retaining information or are only intermittently competent to make a decision should be given assistance to reach
an informed decision. Record any decision made while the patient is
competent, including the key elements of the consultation. Review these
decisions at appropriate intervals before treatment starts, to establish
that this decision can be relied on.

Mentally incapacitated patients
If patients lack the capacity to make an informed decision, you may carry
out an investigation or treatment that is judged to be in their best interests—including treatment for any mental disorder—provided that they
comply with it (see Box 17.2).

Advance statements
Living wills or advance directives must be respected if they are relevant
to the current circumstances.

Box 17.2 “Best interests” principle
This involves addressing the following questions:
- Are there any alternative options for treatment or investigation that
are clinically indicated?
- Is there any evidence of the patient’s previously expressed
preferences, including an advance statement?
- What is your own and the health-care team’s knowledge of the
patient’s background, such as cultural, religious, or employment
issues?
- What are the views about the patient’s preferences given by a third
party who may have knowledge of the patient, for example, the
patient’s partner, family, or caregiver?
- Which option least restricts the patient’s future choices, where
more than one option (including non-treatment) seems reasonable
in the patient’s best interest?

Seeking legal counsel
Application to the court may be needed if a patient’s capacity to consent
is in doubt or if there are differences of opinion over the patient’s best
interest. This can occur for non-therapeutic or controversial treatments
such as organ donation, sterilization or turning off life support.

CHAPTER 17

Common operations

Tonsillectomy
Indications
-

Recurrent acute tonsillitis
Chronic tonsillitis
Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) syndrome
Oropharyngeal obstruction
Following one or more peritonsillar abscesses
Suspected malignancy

Preoperative checks
Examine the pharynx prior to surgery to rule out acute tonsillitis. Discuss
the surgery, complications, and the need for time off work or school.

Procedure
Administer endotracheal anesthesia and place patient supine with a bolster
under the shoulder and the head supported. This position extends the
neck. The nasopharynx is lower than the oropharynx, so blood collects
there (Fig. 17.1). Insert and suspend a mouth gag.
The tonsil is grasped with an Allis clamp and retracted medially. Incise
the mucosa over the anterior pillar. Dissection is carried to the tonsillar
capsule, within a quasi-bloodless plane. The superior pharyngeal constrictor
muscle should be kept laterally. The procedure proceeds from superior to
inferior where the tonsil approaches the lingual tonsillar tissue. Care must
be taken to preserve the posterior tonsillar pillar. Hemostasis of the tonsillar fossa may be achieved using electrocautery or topical hemostatic
agents.

Postoperative care
Appropriate pain relief often includes combination acetaminophen and
opiate narcotics. One dietary regimen includes clear liquids x 24 hours,
then soft foods for 1 week and advance. Monitor the patient for blood
loss. Major blood loss is obvious, but minor loss in a young child manifests itself as a rising pulse without increasing pain. Avoid aspirin and
NSAIDS.

Complications
-

Primary hemorrhage <1%
Secondary hemorrhage 5%–10%
Infection
Dehydration
Poor pain control

Length of stay
This depends on the unit; the patient may stay in for the day, or overnight.

Discharge advice
Regular analgesia should be taken as the pain often increases around 5 to
7 days after the operation. Give the patient contact details and advice in
case of hemorrhage. Patients should stay off work or out of school for
1–2 weeks and avoid strenuous activity for 2 weeks.

TONSILLECTOMY 1

Fig. 17.1 Diagram showing tonsillectomy position.

365

366

CHAPTER 17

Common operations

Adenoidectomy
Indications
Hypertrophic adenoid tissue may obstruct the nasal airway, contributing
to snoring, mouth breathing, hyponasal voice, or obstructive apneas.
Adenoidal tissue may also contribute to recurrent otitis media or otitis
media with effusion. Adenoidectomy may be considered in an adult to
obtain biopsy tissue for ruling out infective processes or neoplasms.

Preoperative checks
- Confirm the diagnosis with nasal endoscopy or lateral neck soft tissue
X-ray.
- Consider an HIV test in an adult with a hypertrophic adenoid.
- Discuss the surgery, complications, and need for time off work or out
of school.

Procedure
-

Administer the patient a general anesthetic (GA).
Position the patient supine with a small shoulder roll.
Check for bifid uvula or submucous cleft palate.
Insert and suspend a mouth gag to increase pharyngeal exposure.
Rubber catheters or a palate elevator can be used as well.
A nasopharyngeal mirror can be used for direct visualization.
The adenoid pad may be removed via curette, electrocautery,
radiofrequency ablation, or microdebrider.
- Provide hemostasis with cotton gauze pack in the nasopharynx.

Postoperative care
Acetaminophen usually suffices for analgesia. The patient should expect a
mildly sore throat. Bleeding is generally minimal.

Complications
Primary hemorrhage is rare, in less than 1% of patients. If it is uncontrolled, examination under anesthesia with cautery may be necessary.
A hypernasal voice (called rhinolalia aperta) may occur if there is velopharyngeal insufficiency (VPI). This complication can severely impact
quality of life, especially if nasal regurgitation occurs. Retropharyngeal
abscesses may require incision and drainage. Infection should be treated
with appropriate antibiotics. Vertebral body subluxation and meningitis
are extremely rare yet devastating complications.

Length of stay
An adenoidectomy is generally performed as an outpatient procedure.
Patients with OSA who also undergo tonsillectomy should be monitored
overnight.

Discharge advice
Most patients will recover rapidly and may require 1 week’s rest at home.

TYMPANOSTOMY TUBE INSERTION 1

Tympanostomy tube insertion
Indications
The patient may present with drum atelectasis, recurrent acute otitis
media, and/or persistent middle ear effusion. They may have eustachian
tube dysfunction. Rarely, the patient may be undergoing hyperbaric oxygen
therapy and cannot equalize pressure.

Preoperative checks
Examine the ear prior to surgery and review the audiogram and tympanometry. Examine the patient’s EAC to check access if the operation is
being done under local anesthetic.

Procedure
- Use a local or a general anesthetic.
- If a local anesthetic is used, EMLA cream, phenol, or tympanomeatal
injection should be instilled under microscope control.
- Using a microscope, insert an ear speculum and identify the anteroinferior segment. Perform a myringotomy using a myringotomy knife.
Enough fluid is aspirated to allow the tympanostomy tube to be
inserted. The tympanostomy tube is placed through the myringotomy
with alligator forceps, and then adjusted with a pick as required.
- If bleeding occurs, use steroid drops to help prevent the tube from
occluding.

Postoperative care
Pain is usually minimal and acetaminophen suffices. Topical antibiotic
drops may be instilled for a few days postoperatively.

Complications
Occasionally, there may be an infective discharge. Treat this with antibiotic
and steroid drops for 1 week. Bleeding from the canal or drum is generally
self-limited and topical drops may benefit. The tubes frequently obstruct
and may require replacement. Persistent drum perforation is rare, but may
necessitate myringoplasty.

Length of stay
This procedure is generally performed in the office (adults) or as ambulatory surgery.

Discharge advice
Many children will swim with tympanostomy tubes in place and have no
problem; however, precautions should be taken if discharge follows
swimming. Use waterproof earplugs with a swimming cap when bathing.
Use similar earplugs for hair washing. Some physicians recommend earplugs anytime the ears may get wet. The initial postoperative visit at 3–4
weeks should be used to document tube patency and obtain an audiogram
to determine any change in hearing status.

367

368

CHAPTER 17

Common operations

Tympanoplasty
Indications
-

Tympanic membrane perforation
Severe atelectasis, eustachian tube dysfunction
Cholesteatoma
Chronic otitis media

Preoperative care
-

Eliminate infection when possible
Examine patient with the microscope in supine position
Assess for tympanosclerosis, granulation tissue, cholesteatoma
Determine status of the scutum and ossicular chain
Complete audiometric examination
CT imaging of the temporal bone

Procedure
Anesthetize the patient under GA. Place the head on a ring support with
the diseased ear facing upward. The canal is infiltrated with local anesthetic and epinephrine in four quadrants. Clean the ear and prep it with
iodine disinfectant. Freshen the perforation edges, then drape the patient.
Either a transcanal or postauricular approach may be employed. Under
microscopic guidance, use a canal or round knife to create a flap of canal skin
and tympanic membrane. Once elevated, the middle ear can be entered.
Cholesteatoma limited to the mesotympanum can be carefully removed.
Examine the ossicles for erosion, necrosis, discontinuity, or involvement by
cholesteatoma.
Harvest a temporalis fascia graft from the postauricular region, press it
and allow it to dry. In the underlay technique, the graft is placed deep to
the tympanic membrane. Pack the middle ear with absorbable gelatin foam
for the graft to rest upon. Replace the flap along the posterior canal and
pack the external ear canal. Close the postauricular incision.
The ossicular chain can be reconstructed with a prosthesis if needed.
Tragal cartilage can be used to reconstruct the attic wall.

Postoperative care
The external canal is generally packed with gelatin foam or antibioticimpregnated gauze. This should be left in place for 6 weeks and removed
in the office. An audiogram will be performed at that time. Topical antibiotic drops are unnecessary prior to the 6-week follow-up. The postauricular incision is often closed with subcuticular sutures which does not
need to be removed. Steri-strips will fall off in 1–2 weeks.

TYMPANOPLASTY 1

Complications
-

Graft failure with persistent perforation
Sensorineural or conductive hearing loss
Postoperative vertigo
Ear bleeding or infection
Prosthesis migration or extrusion
Recurrent cholesteatoma
Facial nerve injury

Length of stay
This procedure is most often performed on an outpatient basis but
patients may be observed overnight, especially if vertigo ensues or if the
patient is very young or elderly.

Discharge advice
Patients are instructed not to blow their nose or perform Valsalva
maneuvers. The mastoid dressing may be left in place for 48 hours.
Hair washing may resume after 72 hours when the postauricular incision
is healed, but the ear should be kept dry. The cotton ball at the external
meatus should be changed when saturated. The patient should expect a
clogged ear until 6 weeks after surgery.

369

370

CHAPTER 17

Common operations

Septoplasty and turbinate reduction
Indications
The patient may present with nasal obstruction or may be having treatment
for epistaxis. A bent septum can limit surgical access to the sinuses—a
septoplasty may be needed to correct this before sinus surgery. Chronically
hypertrophic turbinates may impair nasal airflow. Patients may not respond
to appropriate medications (i.e., antihistamines, decongestants, or nasal
steroid sprays) or wish to avoid long-term use of these medications.

Preoperative checks
Discuss the surgery, its complications, and the need for time off work with
the patient. Examine their ENT system for associated features of rhinitis.
Discuss the need for possible continuing treatment for associated rhinitis.

Procedure
Under general anesthesia, place the patient supine on the operating table
with the head elevated 30*.
The local anesthetic and epinephrine mixture should be infiltrated into
the septum. Approach the septum via a hemitransfixion or Killian incision.
Mucoperichondrial flaps should be elevated on both sides of the septum
and the cartilage repositioned. Resect gross deviations of cartilage or
bone. The 1 cm dorsal and anterior struts should be preserved to keep
support. The incision should be sutured. A through-and-through quilting
suture may help the flaps adhere.
Infiltrate the turbinates with a local anesthetic. The soft tissue may be
reduced using needle point cautery, microdebrider, or radiofrequency
energy. Turbinate bone may be resected submucosally if needed.
The turbinates may be out fractured to increase cross-sectional area.
Alternatively, some surgeons advocate resection of the anterior aspect of
the turbinate including soft tissue and bone. Resection of the entire turbinate, although tempting, may result in severe excessive nasal crusting.
The nose may be packed if necessary.

Postoperative care
Advise the patient to keep their head up and to avoid blowing their nose
for 1 week. The patient may experience nasal crusting and rebound
congestion from manipulation. Packs should be removed within 72 hours.

Complications
Epistaxis may occur and might require prolonged packing or cauterization. Septal hematoma will require incision and drainage. Nasal septal
perforation may occur from infection, flap trauma, or necrosis.

Length of stay
Most often this procedure is considered ambulatory surgery.

Discharge advice
The patient should avoid strenuous activity for 2 weeks. Nasal toilet with
saline sniffs should be performed 4 times a day for 2 weeks.

DIRECT LARYNGOSCOPY 1

Direct laryngoscopy
Indications
Direct laryngoscopy involves the use of a rigid laryngoscope, inserted
transorally, and advanced to the level of the larynx for viewing laryngeal
anatomy. The procedure is indicated for the following:
- Assessing the extent of and performing biopsy of tumors of the
laryngopharynx and biopsy
- Evaluating the upper airway following trauma (mechanical or caustic)
- Retrieving foreign bodies
- Excising or ablating benign vocal fold lesions
- Vocal fold augmentation

Preoperative checks
Often the patient will have undergone flexible or indirect laryngoscopy
prior to direct laryngoscopy. Educate the patient about local trauma that
may follow the insertion of a rigid scope. Dental evaluation with necessary
extractions is useful if there are loose teeth. Check for cervical neck range
of motion.

Procedure
Place the patient supine in the “sniffing position” with the lower cervical
neck slightly flexed and the upper neck extended. The procedure may be
performed under general endotracheal, jet ventilation, or spontaneous
respiration anesthesia. Once the teeth are protected, advance the laryngoscope through the oral cavity and pharynx posterior to the epiglottis
to visualize the larynx. Additional pressure on the anterior neck, at the
level of the cricoid cartilage, helps gain additional exposure. The scope
may then be suspended on a Mayo stand or suspension apparatus.
A microscope may be used for magnification if vocal cord surgery is
planned. Biopsies may be obtained using laryngeal biopsy forceps. Once
complete, gently remove the scope under direct visualization.

Postoperative care and discharge advice
Patients should be alerted to the possibility of dysphagia and throat pain.
If extensive manipulation around the airway was performed, consider IV
steroid administration and airway observation in the hospital. Hoarseness
may result from local edema, secretions, and vocal fold trauma.

Complications
-

Airway obstruction
Hoarseness (usually transient)
Hemoptysis
Aspiration

Length of stay
Depending on the status of the airway, the procedure may be performed
on an outpatient basis.

371

372

CHAPTER 17

Common operations

Complications of ear surgery
There are risks with all surgical procedures. The degree of risk is related
to both the specific procedure and the underlying pathology. The patient
should be given an indication of the likely risk in a sensitive way, so that
they are not frightened into abandoning surgery.
A full explanation of the underlying condition will highlight the risks of
leaving an ear disease untreated. Risks should be documented in the case
notes and on the consent form.
The list of complications for CSOM is similar to that for the
operation—the untreated disease carries similar risks to those of the
operation. These include the following:
- Hearing loss—temporary and permanent. Always obtain an audiogram
at least within 3 months of surgery, but preferably closer to the time of
surgery, and perform preoperative tuning fork tests and document
your findings.
- Tinnitus—temporary and permanent
- Vertigo or unsteadiness—temporary and permanent
- Facial nerve palsy—temporary and permanent
- Wound infection
- Need for further surgery
- Formation of mastoid cavity with need for ongoing care, e.g., aural toilet

Intraoperative considerations
Many complications can be avoided by taking precautions, e.g., always
setting up and checking items such as facial nerve monitors yourself.
The precautions taken in the operating room, such as use of a facial
nerve monitor, should be recorded on the operation note. Any intraoperative findings or complications should be witnessed and recorded by a
senior colleague if available.

Immediate postoperative period
Check for facial nerve palsy in recovery.

Postoperative ward review
Facial nerve function should be checked, along with the eye movements
for nystagmus. Weber’s tuning fork test should be done. The patient
should hear the sound in the operated ear.

COMPLICATIONS OF NASAL SURGERY 1

Complications of nasal surgery
Nasal surgery includes a large range of procedures on both the external
and the internal nose. Procedures on the sinuses are also included.

Complications of external nose surgery
-

Imperfect cosmetic result or deformity
Poor healing of incisions, granuloma, and keloid formation
Ecchymosis
Prolonged swelling
Nasal obstruction
Dorsal, alar, or tip collapse

Complications of internal nose surgery
- Bleeding and need for packing
- Infection
- Change in nasal shape, e.g., supratip depression with submucous
resection (SMR)
- Persistence of nasal blockage for 3 months, or synechia formation
- Need for adjunctive medication.

Complications of sinus surgery
-

Bleeding
Infection
Orbital damage
Orbital hematoma
Optic nerve damage
CSF leak or intracranial injury

Prevention of complications
Intraoperative considerations
- Good vasoconstriction to maximize vision in operative field and
prevent blood loss
- Head-up position to improve venous drainage
- Have preoperative CT scans displayed during surgery to avoid
unexpected anatomical variations
- Use of steroids to reduce edema in rhinoplasty
- Swab samples for infected sinus problems
Postoperative problems
- Observation for bleeding—repack if necessary
- Check for orbital hemorrhage
- Check for visual disturbance

CHAPTER 17

Common operations

Complications of head and
neck surgery
These procedures are often prolonged. They can have high morbidity
rates and sometimes an associated mortality. The patient group is older
and the comorbidities associated with heavy smoking and alcohol abuse
make the risks even higher.

Major risks
-

Death
Cardiovascular complications
Myocardial infarction (MI)
Deep venous thrombosis (DVT)
Chest infections
Pulmonary embolism (PE)
Flap failure

Preoperative considerations
-

Prophylactic antibiotics
Thromboembolic prophylaxis
Chest physiotherapy
Preoperative nutrition—involve dietician
Smoking cessation
Admit early for assessment and alcohol detox if necessary

Postoperative considerations
-

Continued thromboembolic prophylaxis and early mobilization
Antibiotics
Chest physiotherapy
Balance between analgesia and respiratory depression
Early removal of central and peripheral lines
Removal of urinary catheter

CHAPTER 18

Ward care

Preoperative care
Preoperative evaluation
The importance of the preoperative evaluation cannot be understated.
Guidelines regarding the extent of preoperative evaluation are institution
and physician dependent. Variables taken into consideration include
patient age, type and length of surgical procedure planned, anticipated
extent of hospitalization, and comorbid medical conditions. In general,
patients will undergo preoperative blood testing and clinical examination
by a presurgical clinical team or primary care provider. If additional testing
is needed, the patient may be sent to a specialist for further medical
evaluation.
Institutional directives, aimed at providing cost-effective care, attempt
to streamline the preoperative evaluation process. Unnecessary testing
raises health-care costs without providing additional medical benefit.
However, patient safety is also a primary concern. Surgical morbidity
arising from an incomplete preoperative evaluation can be disastrous.
The surgeon, anesthesiologist, and preoperative team must work together
to promote a safe, cost-effective approach for each patient planned for
surgery.
Although no consensus for preoperative screening in routine elective surery exists, the following list is a proposed guideline for the asymptomatic,
healthy patient:
-

Hemoglobin level or CBC if excessive blood loss anticipated
Type and screen/cross-match if excessive blood loss anticipated
Serum creatinine level for patient age >40
EKG for patient age >40
CXR for patient age >60

Additional testing should be ordered on the basis of clinical indicators
from the complete history and physical examination. These may include
coagulation profile (PT/aPTT), bleeding time, urinalysis, electrolytes,
glucose level, liver function tests, echocardiogram, pulmonary function
tests, and pregnancy testing in women of child-bearing age.

CHAPTER 18

Ward care

Special considerations
Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis
The risk of DVT for all surgical patients should be classified as low, medium,
or high (see Box 18.1). This is determined by length of surgery, the patient’s
underlying condition, and past thromboembolic history.
Low
Medium
High

Compression stockings
Compression stockings + LMW heparin + intraoperative
compression boots
Stockings + LMW heparin + intraoperative compression

(e.g., dalteparin sodium)
Medium risk
High risk

2500 U 1–2 hours preoperatively
2500 U every 24 hours until ambulatory
2500 U 1–2 hours preoperatively
5000 U every 24 hours

Antibiotic prophylaxis
Antibiotics may be given to patients with preexisting cardiac problems
such as valve insufficiency or for patients who have had major head and
neck surgery, to reduce the risk of postoperative infection and fistula
formation. Antibiotics should be given within 60 minutes of beginning the
procedure. Routine prophylaxis is not required for simple clean wounds,
but should be given for clean-contaminated and contaminated wounds.
- Cefazolin 1 g or clindamycin 600–900 mg preoperatively and for
24 hours for skin or oropharyngeal procedures
- Clindamycin 600 mg IV every 8 hours + gentamycin 1.5 mg/kg (check
peak and trough serum levels) for broad-spectrum coverage including
Pseudomonas aeruginosa

Diabetic patients
Diabetic patients should be placed first on the operating list. Non-insulindependent patients should avoid oral hypoglycemic agents on the morning
of surgery. Insulin-dependent patients may take half the usual morning
dose of regular insulin and avoid long-acting formulations on the day of
surgery. Take regular finger sticks to monitor sugar level. Use a slidingscale regular insulin regimen until resuming oral feeds. Table 18.1 gives a
common sliding-scale insulin regimen.

CHAPTER 18

Ward care

Postoperative care
Documentation
It is important to document the patient’s daily progress and ward round
instructions. Any important changes during the day should also be documented. Use a system approach for major head and neck patients, i.e.,
cardiovascular, pulmonary, renal, nutrition, etc.

Drain care
Monitor suction drainage for each 24-hour period. Remove drains when
outputs are less than 30 ml in a 24-hour period, or 10 ml in an 8-hour shift.
Strip the drain tubing toward the collection apparatus to remove clots.
If the drain loses its vacuum, examine drain position, change the drain
bottle for a new one, and consider pressure to the wound or connect the
drain to continuous low-pressure wall suction. Prior to removing the
drain, take it off suction to avoid injury to underlying structures.
Drains in the neck should be monitored for chyle. This fluid will appear
milky and cloud the suction container. Chylous drainage may occur secondary to interruption of the lymphatic vessels or thoracic duct during neck
dissection. For leaks <600 ml/day, conservative closed-wound management is initiated. Patients are placed on a medium-chain triglyceride diet if
enteral feedings have already begun. Pressure dressings may be applied.
If leaks >600 ml/day occur, early wound exploration with hemostatic clip
ligation of the leaking vessel is recommended.

Nutrition and fluid balance
Involve a dietician for long-term feeding requirements.

Fluid and electrolytes
Calculate 24-hour maintenance fluid requirements by the patient’s weight:
- 0–10 kg 100 ml/kg/24 hours
- 11–20 kg 1000 ml + 50 ml/kg/24 hours
- 20 kg+ 1500 ml + 20 ml/kg/24 hours
This volume of fluid requires a composition of 1 mEq of Na+, 0.5 mEq K+,
and 1.5 mEq Cl− per kg/24 hours.
- 1 liter normal saline contains 154 mEq of Na+ and 154 mEq Cl−.
- 1 liter 1/2 normal saline contains 77 mEq of Na+ and 77 mEq Cl−.
- 1 liter lactated ringers contains 130 mEq Na+, 110 mEq Cl−, 28 mEq
lactate, 4 mEq K+, and 3 mEq Ca2+.
Maintenance hydration with 5% dextrose in 1/2 normal saline with
20 mEq/L of KCl should avoid sodium overload while replenishing potassium losses. Properly kept fluid balance charts are essential for monitoring
the patient’s fluid input and output. Record total intake of liquids (enteral
and intravenous) and output (urine, drains, oral suction canisters).
Pay attention to signs of body fluid excess (edema) and deficit (oliguria,
xerostomia).

POSTOPERATIVE CARE 1

Nutrition
Postoperative patients require between 40 and 70 kcal/kg/day. Protein
requirements range from 1 to 1.5 g/kg/day.
- Fats provide 9 kcal/ gram
- Proteins provide 4 kcal/gram
- Carbohydrates provide 4 kcal/gram
Most ENT patients will be able to be fed via either the mouth or a nasogastric tube (see Boxes 18.2 and 18.3), or by enteral feeding. Patients with
severe aspiration or laryngopharyngeal tumors, and patients who have had
major head and neck surgery may require gastrostomy tube insertion,
especially if a prolonged course is anticipated.
Monitoring intake of calories and other vital substances
- Check weight daily.
- Keep a food record chart.
- Do regular finger stick or urinalysis for glucose.
- Check electrolytes, albumin, and/or prealbumin levels.
- Run vitamins and trace elements screen.

Box 18.2 How to insert a nasogastric tube
-

Decongest or anesthetize the nasal cavity.
Lubricate the tip of the nasogastric tube.
Have the patient sit upright with the head flexed.
Advance the tube through the nose parallel to the hard palate.
Have the patient swallow repeatedly as the tube is advanced down
the pharynx.
- Flush port with air and listen for gurgling in stomach; get a low chest
X-ray for confirmation if unsure or if tube is to be used for feeding.
- Secure the tube to the nasal ala and dorsum.

CHAPTER 18

Ward care

Postoperative fever
The body’s temperature is controlled by the hypothalamus. Fever arises
when an alteration in thermoregulatory control causes a temperature
set-point elevation. Both infectious and noninfectious causes may alter
the temperature set-point.
The febrile patient should undergo a complete history and physical
examination. Repeat taking the patient’s temperature to confirm fever.
Assess all current medications taken, including antibiotics. Examine the
surgical wound and surrounding tissues. Listen to the chest, and palpate
the abdomen and extremities for tenderness.
On the basis of the examination, obtain cultures from infected sites.
Should the cause remain elusive, the following tests should be considered:
CBC with differential, urinalysis, chest X-ray, wound, sputum, blood, and
catheter tip cultures.
Antipyretics (e.g., acetaminophen) may be useful if the fever is severely
elevated, causing patient discomfort. Be aware, however, that antipyretics
may mask fever trends. Note that within the first 48–72 hours after
surgery, atelectasis ensues, and ambulation or incentive spirometry may
resolve the fever. Wound infections generally do not arise until the third
or fourth postoperative day. Antibiotic therapy should be tailored
according to clinical and microbial assessment. Table 18.2 lists some of
the common causes for postoperative fever.

CHAPTER 18

Ward care

Care of reconstructive flaps
Reconstructive flaps, either pedicled or transferred as free tissue, are
useful to cover large surgical defects in the head and neck. Regional or
distant tissues for reconstruction are brought into the defect and vascularized by a pedicle or vessel anastamosis.
It is very important to monitor the viability of these flaps accurately.
Often patients are nursed on wards with limited plastic surgery expertise.
There is no accepted protocol for postoperative flap care, so discuss
specific measures with the surgeon. Immediate intervention may be
required if flap failure ensues.

Possible complications
Vascular compromise
- Arterial insufficiency (usually within 24 hours of surgery) manifests as a
cool, pale flap that fails to blanch with gentle pressure.
- Venous congestion (develops 48–72 hours postoperatively) presents as
a warm, often darker-colored flap that blanches to pressure and bleeds
briskly with pinprick.
Hematoma formation necessitates aspiration to prevent necrosis, delayed
vascular ingrowth, and infection.
Superficial necrosis/epidermolysis is managed initially by gentle debridement
and wet-to-dry dressings.
Infection may require incision and drainage for abscess collection or IV
antibiotics for cellulitis.

General principles
- Maintain intravascular volume.
- Maintain adequate hematocrit for oxygen carrying capacity (but not
polycythemia).
- Monitor flap appearance by using a flap chart to denote demarcating
areas and location of Doppler signal/pedicle.
- Consider antibiotic administration for 24 hours or longer.
- Steroid administration is controversial but may help improve vascular
supply by reducing tissue edema.
- Aspirin is usually administered after surgery, once daily.
- Alert reconstructive surgeon immediately if signs of flap failure
develop.
Example of hemodynamic goals
- Keep pulse <100
- Maintain systolic BP >100 mmHg
- Keep urine output >35 ml/hr
- Aim for hemoglobin level of 8.5–10.5 g/dl
- If hematocrit <25, give blood

CARE OF RECONSTRUCTIVE FLAPS 1

Flap observations
- Direct visualization and assessment of capillary refill with or without
needle prick is the most important task.
- A handheld Doppler or Doppler implant may be used to assess blood
flow.
- An example of a flap-check schedule may be to assess
- every 30 min for the first 4 hours, then
- every hour for the next 48 hours, then
- every 2 hours for the next 48 hours.

Managing vascular compromise
- Venous congestion
- Release sutures that may be compromising capillary flow.
- Serial pinpricks
- Medicinal leeches
- Arterial insufficiency
- Mark the flap at the demarcation line.
- Debride necrotic tissue.
- Advancement of healthy flap into demarcated areas may help
prevent wound contracture.
- Colloids (i.e., dextran) and anticoagulant benefit unclear
- Hyperbaric oxygen may enhance tissue viability. It may benefit ischemic
and congested tissues if available and when instituted early.

385

386

CHAPTER 18

Ward care

Tracheostomy care
The formation of a tracheostomy causes some physiological problems,
mainly because it bypasses the nose. The initial requirements of inspired
air are humidification, warming, and filtering. After 48 hours the mucous
glands in the trachea hypertrophy and help in this process. Tracheostomy
care in the early postoperative period centers on avoiding tube obstruction,
dislodgement, soft tissue and tracheal infection, and irritation.

Avoiding tracheostomy tube obstruction
- Humidification of inspired air or oxygen
- Soft suction or irrigation of the tracheostomy lumen every 1–2 hours
- Changing the inner cannula each nursing shift

Avoiding tube dislodgment
- Sutures are placed through the flange during surgery, and remain for
1 week. A neck tie or strap provides additional reinforcement.
- Inner cannula changes should be done gently while securing the
remainder of the tube in place.
- Agitated patients may need to be restrained or sedated for safety.
- A Bjork flap or stay sutures through tracheal cartilage assist in
replacement if accidental dislodgement occurs.
- The tracheostomy site generally “matures” after 1 week.

Avoiding irritation caused by the tube
- The presence of the tube can cause coughing and excess secretion
from the bronchopulmonary tree.
- The cuff pressure should be checked routinely to avoid overinflation
and tracheal irritation.
- Tracheal irritation can result in a nidus for infection, tracheal erosion,
tracheo-innominate fistula, and tracheal stenosis.

Avoiding tracheobronchial infection
- Tracheostomy care should be performed regularly with sterile
equipment.
- The tube should be changed first at 1 week postoperatively, and then
every 4–6 weeks.
- Purulent material from the wound or tracheal lumen should be sent
for culture. Antibiotic therapy may need to be instituted against
pathogenic organisms in the sick patient. Note: tubes are often colonized by bacterial flora, which do not necessarily mandate antibiotic
administration.

2 Important
Always keep a spare tracheostomy tube, tracheal dilators, inner cannulas,
and a suture removal set by the bedside of tracheostomy patients.

COMMUNICATION WITH PATIENTS AND RELATIVES 1

Communication with patients
and relatives
Patients and relatives may be eager to speak with the surgeon following
surgery. Communicating with patients and family causes anxiety in many
doctors, as it is not well taught in medical schools and requires the physician to engage in empathetic interpersonal behavior rather than medical
or technical prowess.

Basic principles
- Read the patient’s notes thoroughly, obtain the facts, and be prepared
before any formal talk with a patient or their relatives.
- Anticipate what the involved parties may want to know. Try placing
yourself in their position.
- Physically lower yourself to eye level and maintain eye contact
throughout the discussion.
- Always speak plainly and honestly.
- Discuss what to expect while in the hospital and thereafter, and provide
reassurance that the patient will be well taken care of.

Delivering bad news
Delivering bad news to the patient and family is difficult for most physicians, but having a delineated approach can ease the discomfort for both
parties. One such approach is described below.
Establish the setting
- Create an environment conducive to effective communication.
- Ask the patient who they want present, i.e., caregivers.
Determine what the patient knows
- Find out what the patient and family know about the condition.
Determine what the patient wants to know
- Each patient has the right to decline receiving information and
designate someone else to act on their behalf.
- Ask whether they want to know the specific details or simply the
diagnosis.
Share the news
- Discuss the information in a caring yet straightforward manner.
Respond appropriately to the reaction
- Accept the reaction empathetically and realize that people react to
bad news in different ways, i.e. denial, irrational behavior, or silence.
Plan for the next step
- Discuss any additional testing or therapy that will be required.

387

CHAPTER 18

Ward care

Discharge planning
Discharging a patient from the hospital following surgery requires
thoughtful consideration of many factors. While in the hospital, the
patient generally has access to doctors, nursing staff, pain management
clinicians, medications, and ancillary supplies to assist with difficulties.
Once the patient leaves the hospital, these benefits are discontinued
unless specifically ordered and arranged in advance.
Discharge planning should become a coordinated effort between the
surgical team, nurses, case manager, and social worker. Planning should
begin as soon as the surgery is complete. Despite pressures to discharge
patients quickly, the patient must first meet the medical requirements for
discharge and all appropriate home care must be arranged.

General points
Consideration of the following questions will help in planning effective
discharge.
Meeting discharge criteria
- Are the vital signs and airway stable?
- Is the patient fit to leave—is he or she orientated, mobile, and pain
free?
- Is the patient’s nutritional support provided for? Have all necessary
lines and catheters been removed?
- Is their wound satisfactory?
Medications and supplies
- Does the patient have all necessary medication prescriptions?
- Does the patient require supplemental nutrition?
- If the patient has a tracheostomy, have the necessary suction equipment, tubing, humidification apparatus, care kits, and spare tubes been
ordered?
- Does the patient have wound care supplies, e.g., gauze and tape?
Ancillary services
- Does the patient need transport?
- Is a home-care or visiting nurse required?
- Do any medications need monitoring, such as warfarin?
- Does the patient’s primary care physician need to know that the
patient is leaving the hospital before the discharge letter arrives?
Patient understanding of instructions
- Does the patient understand
- How to care for the surgical incision?
- What the limitations are regarding mobility, feeding, and bathing?
- When he or she may return to school or work?
- The correct medication regimen to follow?
- Who to call in case of emergency?
- When to follow up with the surgeon or other physician?

CHAPTER 19

Practical procedures

How to cauterize the nose
Most nosebleeds originate from the anterior nasal septum at Kiesselbach’s
plexus. Vessels converge within this site, lying just deep to the nasal
mucosa. Exposure to the bleeding site is facilitated with a nasal speculum,
headlight, and Fraser suction. Make sure to protect yourself with gloves, a
gown, and eye protection. Always ensure that you have performed adequate first-aid steps before attempting to pack or cauterize the nose
(see Chapter 20, p. 410). Obtaining a complete blood count and coagulation profile may help identify a platelet or clotting disorder that should be
corrected.

Procedure
- Position the patient in the seated upright position.
- Apply one or two cotton buds or a dental roll soaked in 1:10,000
epinephrine and 2% lidocaine, or 4% cocaine solution to the area, and
apply pressure for at least 5 minutes.
- Silver nitrate sticks may be applied to the bleeding point for 1 or 2
seconds at a time. Avoid using this form of cautery if the nose is
actively bleeding since the blood will simply wash the chemical away.
In addition to being ineffective, this will cause unwanted burns to the
lip, nose or throat. Instead, wait for the vasoconstrictive effects of
the cocaine to work, then apply pressure to the bleeding point.
This will nearly always stop the bleeding temporarily before cautery.
- Apply the silver nitrate in a circle starting a few mm from the bleeding
point. This will allow any feeding blood vessels to be dealt with prior
to cauterizing the main bleeding vessel. A gray eschar should form.
- It may be necessary to reapply the epinephrine or cocaine soaked
cotton patty to reduce the bleeding between attempts at cautery.
Alternatively, an injection of 1% lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine
into the submucoperichondrial plane may decrease bleeding.
- If the nose is still bleeding reapply pressure, and consider packing
the nose.
- Electro- or hot wire cautery may be used to good effect in experienced hands.
- If the bleeding site is not immediately obvious, rigid or flexible nasal
endoscopy may help.

CHAPTER 19

Practical procedures

How to pack the nose
Should cauterization fail to control epistaxis, nasal packing is employed.
The goal of nasal packing is to apply pressure to the area of hemorrhage,
thereby allowing the body’s inherent clotting mechanism to activate.
Nasal packs are usually left in place for 24–48 hours. They must be secured
anteriorly to prevent them falling back into the airway. Prophylactic antibiotics are often used. Different methods and materials are used to pack the
nose.
Always ensure that you have performed adequate first aid steps before
attempting to pack or cauterize the nose (see Chapter 20, p. 410).

Anterior nasal packing
Nasal tampons
Nasal tampons are the simplest way to pack the nose (see Fig. 19.1).
They consist of a dry sponge, which is placed into the nasal cavity and
then hydrated with water or saline. The sponge then dramatically
increases in size, compressing the bleeding area. The nasal tampon should
be lubricated with an antibiotic ointment prior to insertion. The tip of the
nose is lifted and the tampon completely inserted into the nasal cavity,
ensuring that it is passed parallel to the floor of the nose. Water or saline
is then dripped onto the tampon, which is secured by taping the attached
string to the face.
Ribbon gauze packing
Petrolatum-impregnated ribbon gauze may be used to control anterior
nosebleeds. Some skill and a good light are needed to place this form of
nasal pack effectively. The ribbon is inserted in a layered fashion beginning at the nasal floor and progressing superiorly. The ends of the ribbon
should lie externally to prevent ribbon migration posteriorly. Topical
analgesia such as lidocaine or cocaine spray is essential prior to packing
as this technique may be poorly tolerated by the patient.

Posterior nasal packing
Epistaxis balloon or urinary catheter
A variety of nasal balloons are available (see Fig. 19.2). They are easy to
insert and are particularly helpful when the bleeding point is posterior.
A Foley urinary catheter is also effective. This is passed into the nasopharynx, inflated, and then pulled anteriorly so that it occludes the posterior
choana. It is prevented from slipping back into the nasopharynx or mouth
by means of a clamp, which is placed at the nasal vestibule. It is important
to put some padding between the skin and a clamp to ensure that no
pressure damage is caused. Ribbon gauze may be used to tamponade the
anterior nasal cavity and prevent pressure necrosis from the catheter
upon the nasal alae.

CHAPTER 19

Practical procedures

How to remove foreign bodies
You will need
- a good light.
- a cooperative patient, and
- good equipment.
The first attempt will usually be the best tolerated. Avoid continued
attempts in the anxious child or if significant bleeding occurs.

Foreign bodies in the ear
Signs and symptoms
- Pain
- Hearing loss
- Unilateral discharge
- Bleeding
- May be asymptomatic
Management
- Children will usually require a general anesthetic unless they are
remarkably cooperative.
- Insects may be drowned with mineral oil or lidocaine.
- Syringe irrigation may be used if you can be certain there is no trauma
to the ear canal or drum. Caution: vegetable material may swell and
further obstruct the canal with hydration.
- Use a head lamp or mirror, an operating otoscope or microscope.
- Soft foreign bodies (FB) such as cotton wool may be grasped with a
pair of alligator or Tilley’s forceps.
- Solid foreign bodies such as a bead are best remove by passing a wax
hook or Jobson–Horne probe beyond the foreign body and gently
pulling toward you.
Post-procedural care
- Examine the ear canal and assess for a retained FB or trauma to the
ear canal or tympanic membrane.
- Apply a single dose of topical antibiotic drops unless a longer course is
required for grossly infected ears.
- Perform audiometric examination.
- Instruct the patient to avoid placing foreign bodies, i.e., cotton swabs,
in the ear and prevent water from entering the ear if traumatized.
ENT referral
- Refer patient to a specialist if the FB is not easily removed, bleeding
ensues, or trauma to the ear canal or tympanic membrane occurs.

HOW TO REMOVE FOREIGN BODIES 1

Foreign bodies in the nose
Signs and symptoms
- Unilateral foul-smelling discharge
- Unilateral nasal obstruction
- Unilateral vestibulitis
- Epistaxis.
Types of foreign bodies
- Vegetative, i.e., beans, nuts, peas, pits, fruit
- Inanimate, i.e., clay, beads, jewelry, hardware, crayons, erasers
- Alkaline batteries constitute an ENT emergency.
- Rhinoliths are calcified nasal masses resulting from a retained FB for
long periods.
Management
- An otoscope can easily be used to examine a child’s nose.
- Ask the child to blow their nose if they are able.
- Solid foreign bodies such as beads are best removed by passing a wax
hook or Jobson–Horne probe beyond the FB and gently pulling it
toward you. Avoid grasping the object with a pair of forceps, since this
may simply push it further back into the nose or airway.
- Soft foreign bodies may be grasped and removed with alligator or
Tilley’s forceps.
ENT referral
- Failed removal
- Excessive bleeding
- Uncooperative child.

Foreign bodies in the throat
See also Esophageal foreign bodies, Chapter 20, p. 422. The cause is often
fish or chicken bones.
Signs and symptoms
- Acute onset of symptoms (not days later)
- Constant pricking sensation on every swallow
- Drooling
- Dysphagia
- Localized tenderness in the neck; if above the thyroid cartilage then
look carefully in the tongue base and tonsil regions
- Pain on rocking the larynx from side to side
- Soft tissue swelling

395

396

CHAPTER 19

Practical procedures

Management
- Use a good light to examine the patient.
- Spray the throat with topical anesthetic.
- Try feeling for a FB even if you cannot see one in the tonsil or tongue
base.
- Flecks of calcification around the thyroid cartilage are common on
X-ray.
- Perform an AP and lateral soft-tissue radiograph of the neck, looking
for foreign bodies at the common sites (see Fig. 19.3). Pay particular
attention to the following:
- Tonsil
- Tongue base/vallecula
- Posterior pharyngeal wall.
- For foreign bodies not visualized transorally, the patient may be placed
supine with a shoulder roll. A Macintosh or Miller laryngoscope can be
inserted gently to the vallecula if tolerated. Alternatively, transnasal
flexible pharyngoscopy can be used to guide a transoral extraction.
These techniques require considerable experience.
- Tilley’s forceps are best for removing foreign bodies in the mouth.
- McGill’s intubating forceps may be useful for removing foreign bodies
in the tongue base or pharynx.
Refer for endoscopy under GA in case of
- Airway compromise—URGENT
- Failed removal
- Good history but no FB seen
- X-ray evidence of a FB

How to irrigate an ear
See Fig. 19.4. Check that the patient has no previous history of TM perforation, grommet insertion, or middle ear or mastoid surgery. Irrigation in
these circumstances may precipitate middle or inner ear trauma and
infection.

Procedure
-

Warm the water to body temperature.
Pull the pinna up and back.
Use a dedicated ear syringe.
Aim the jet of water toward the roof of the ear canal.
Collect water and cerumen into a basin beneath the ear.
Repeat as necessary until the canal is clear.
STOP if the patient complains of pain.

CHAPTER 19

Practical procedures

How to dry a draining ear
Drying an ear with cottonoids should be performed in any ear that is
discharging, before topical antibiotics and steroid eardrops are instilled.
Since topical antibiotic therapy works by contact, removal of exudate and
drainage are necessary to enhance the medication’s benefit.

Procedure
- Tease out a clean piece of cotton into a flat sheet
- Twist the cotton onto a suitable carrier such as an orange stick, a
Jobson–Horne probe, or even a clean cotton-tipped applicator;
see Fig. 19.5.
- Gently rotate the soft end of the cottonoid in the ear canal and
remove it.
- Discard the cotton wool and make a new cottonoid—continue until
the cotton is returned clean.

CHAPTER 19

Practical procedures

How to instill eardrops
See Fig. 19.6.

Procedure
-

Have the patient lie down with the affected ear positioned uppermost.
Straighten the ear canal by pulling the pinna up and back.
Squeeze in the appropriate number of drops.
Use a gentle pumping motion of your finger against the tragus. This will
encourage the drops to penetrate into the deep ear canal.
- Have the patient remain with the affected ear upward for at least
10 minutes.
- A cotton ball may be placed at the external meatus.
Consider using an “otowick.” This is a preformed sponge and acts as a
reservoir, helping to prevent the drops from leaking out of the ear canal.
It also serves to reestablish canal patency by expanding against the edematous soft tissue. An otowick is particularly useful in treating otitis
externa with severe canal soft-tissue edema with luminal obstruction. It is
usually left in place for 48–72 hours prior to removal.

Practical procedures

How to drain a hematoma of
the auricle
This usually occurs after direct trauma to the auricle. It is often caused by
a sports injury such as boxing, rugby, or wrestling. If left untreated it may
leave a permanent deformity such as a “cauliflower” ear.
Do not neglect the associated head injury that may take priority over the ear
injury.

Procedure
- Aspiration may be satisfying, but the collection nearly always reforms,
so it is probably best avoided.
- Refer for drainage in sterile conditions.
- Incise the skin of the auricle under local anesthesia in the helical sulcus
(see Fig. 19.7).
- Milk out the hematoma.
- The wound may be partially closed and a small rubber band or
mini-penrose drain placed.
- Apply pressure to the ear to prevent recollection. Dental rolls or
rolled Vaseline gauze may be bolstered to the ear with through-andthrough sutures.
- Give antibiotics with appropriate coverage for S. aureus and
P. aeruginosa.
- Reevaluate in 4–5 days.

- IV steroid may be administered if trismus prevents adequate exposure.
- Spray the throat with topical anesthetic or inject lidocaine into the
mucosa as shown.
- The patient may be seated upright or semi-reclined.
- Have a headlight and suction available.
- Use a 5 ml syringe and a large-bore needle (18 or 20 G) or IV cannula
to perform three-point aspiration (see Fig. 19.8).
- Send any pus obtained to microbiology.
- Reserve incision for those cases that recur or fail to resolve within
24 hours.
- Continue antibiotic for 10 days. Have patient gargle with salt water,
half-strength peroxide, or oral disinfectant solution.

Procedure
-

Have the patient lie down.
Clean the skin with alcohol.
Fix the lump between your finger and thumb.
Use a fine needle (23 or 25G) attached to a 10 ml syringe.
Pass the needle into the lump.
Apply suction.
Move the needle back and forth through the lump using small
vibration-type movements—this can prevent contamination by sampling
other tissues.
Make some rotary movements to remove a small core of tissue.
Release the suction.
Then remove the needle.
Detach the needle from the syringe and fill it with air.
Replace the needle and expel the contents onto a microscope slide.
Remove the needle and repeat as necessary.
Check the inside of the barrel of the needle for any tissue that may
have become impacted.
Take a second slide and place it on top of the first, sandwiching the
sample between the two.
Briskly slide the two apart, spreading the sample thinly and evenly.
Fix and label the slides.
Apply pressure for 5 minutes and apply a small bandage to the
puncture site.

Epistaxis
Epistaxis, or a nosebleed, is a common problem that will affect many of
us at sometime in our lives. While generally mild and self-limiting, serious
sequelae including aspiration, hypotension, and myocardial infarction may
occur. To properly care for a nosebleed, the physician should have a
solid understanding of the internal nasal anatomy and be familiar with a
variety of techniques to control the hemorrhage. The patient is often
anxious and frightened and should be properly reassured.

Causes of epistaxis
Local causes
- Nose picking
- Idiopathic
- Trauma (fractures, chemicals, nasogastric tubes)
- Foreign bodies
- Infection
- Tumors
Systemic causes
- Hypertension
- Hepatic and renal failure
- Anticoagulant drugs
- NSAIDs and aspirin
- Coagulopathy (hemophilia, leukemia, DIC, Von Willebrand’s disease)
- Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (an inherited condition with a
weakness of the capillary walls leading to vessel fragility)
The anterior aspect of the nasal septum is the most frequent site for
bleeding. It has a rich blood supply and a propensity for digital trauma.
This part of the nose is known as Little’s area (see Fig. 20.1).

First aid for epistaxis
See Fig. 20.2. The patient should be advised to do the following:
- Sit upright with the head extended forward.
- Pinch the fleshy part of the nose (not the bridge) for 10 minutes.
- Avoid swallowing the blood.
- Put an icepack on the nasal bridge.
- Suck an ice cube.

Resuscitation
-

Assess blood loss
Obtain vitals
Provide oxygen
Gain intravenous access
Set up intravenous infusion
Complete blood count and coagulation profile
Type and cross-match

CHAPTER 20

ENT emergencies

Sudden-onset hearing loss
Sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL) is an ENT emergency.
It usually has an acute onset and is sometimes associated with vertigo
and balance disturbance. In 90% of cases, one ear alone is affected.
The average age of onset is 46–50 years. Viral infections, vascular insults,
and autoimmune processes are believed to account for most cases.

Investigations
-

Take a full drug history.
Exclude head or acoustic trauma.
Check the ear canal to exclude cerumen.
Check the ear drum to exclude effusion.
Tuning fork tests:
- Weber lateralizes to opposite ear
- Rinne AC>BC in affected ear
- Audiogram confirms hearing loss and no air/bone gap.
- ESR and autoantibodies may be abnormal if there is an autoimmune
cause for the hearing loss.
- MRI to exclude acoustic neuroma or other intracranial tumors

Management
The prognosis for recovery depends on many factors. Low- or midfrequency losses tend to recover better than isolated high-frequency loss.
If treatment is initiated within 10 days of onset, the recovery rate improves.
If the patient presents within 24–48 hours of onset consider empirical
treatment as below, but there is little evidence base to support it:
- Consider admission for bed rest if perilymphatic fistula is suspected.
- Oral steroids (prednisone 1 mg/kg body weight/day)
- Acyclovir or valacyclovir
- Carbogen gas (a mixture of CO2 and O2 given for 5 minutes inhalation
per waking hour)
- Daily audiograms
- Consider perilymphatic fistula if treatment fails (requires exploration).
If there is any improvement in the hearing at 48 hours, continue with the
treatment. If not, discharge patient on a reducing course of prednisone
and acyclovir.
- Give a 2-week outpatient assessment and retest the hearing.
- Follow blood and/or MRI results. Consider a hearing aid referral.
Patients presenting to the office with SSNHL are often treated as
outpatients. The most common therapeutic trial involves high-dose oral
corticosteroids. It is unclear whether antiviral therapy affects outcome.
Should the hearing deficit persist following the completion of oral steroids,
intratympanic steroid injection should be considered. This procedure may
be performed under local anesthesia in the office setting with an operating
microscope.

CHAPTER 20

ENT emergencies

Facial palsy or VII nerve palsy
Paralysis of the facial nerve can be classified by degree (partial or
complete), timing of onset (sudden or delayed), and nature (central or
peripheral). Causes include traumatic, infectious, neoplastic, congenital,
imflammatory, and vascular. The morbidity of facial paralysis can be both
cosmetically and functionally disturbing to the patient. A thorough diagnostic workup and management strategy are essential. The House–
Brackmann scoring system is frequently used to record the degree of
facial weakness (see Box 20.1).

Facial nerve anatomy
The intracranial segment of the facial nerve includes neural pathways from
the voluntary motor cortex, internal capsule, extrapyramidal system,
midbrain, brainstem, pontine facial nerve nucleus, and cerebellopontine
angle (CPA).
The extracranial portion of the nerve is divided into four segments:
- Meatal segment, which travels through the IAC 8 to 10 mm
- Labyrinthine segment, which runs to the geniculate ganglion where the
greater superficial petrosal nerve exits
- Tympanic segment, which traverses the middle ear posteriorly to the
second genu
- Mastoid segment, which descends inferiorly, gives off the chorda
tympani, and exits the stylomastoid foramen

Initial evaluation
- General neurological and cranial nerve exam—to exclude other
neurologic deficits
- Exclude serious head injury—fracture of the temporal bone may lead
to disruption of the facial nerve in its intratemporal course.
- Examine the ear, looking for cholesteatoma, hemotympanum, middle
ear tumor, otomastoiditis, or disruption of the drum or canal.
- Complete audiometric examination
- Check the parotid gland for masses.

Specialized facial nerve testing
Topographic testing
- Schirmer’s test Evaluates the function of the greater superficial petrosal
branch. This test is used to compare tear production of involved and
uninvolved eyes.
- Acoustic reflex test Evaluates the integrity of the stapedial branch when
stimulated by a loud tone. Lesions proximal to this nerve will diminish
the stapedial response.
Electrodiagnostic testing
- Nerve excitability test Records the minimal amount of current required
to produce a noticeable muscular contraction. A difference of
3.5 mAmp between the involved and uninvolved side is significant.

FACIAL PALSY OR VII NERVE PALSY 1

- Maximal stimulation test The maximum tolerated current is applied to
achieve maximal facial muscle stimulation. The degree of muscle
activity is then compared to that of the unaffected side and graded as
a percentage, signifying the degree of denervation.
- Electromyography Records motor unit potential within facial musculature. Fibrillation potentials may appear within 2–3 weeks after injury and
signify denervation. Reinnervation is heralded by the presence of polyphasic potentials that may arise prior to return of facial motion.
- Electroneurography (ENoG) Maximal stimulation of facial musculature
results in a summation potential whose amplitude is recorded and
compared to that of the uninvolved side. The degree of denervation is
proportional to the difference in amplitudes between the involved and
uninvolved sides.

Causes of lower motor nerve (LMN) facial palsy
-

Bell’s palsy
Ramsay Hunt syndrome
Acute otitis media
Cholesteatoma
CPA tumors such as acoustic neuroma
Trauma
Parotid gland malignancies
Sarcoidosis
Lyme disease, Coxsackie virus, polio, HIV
Congenital causes (craniofacial anomalies, forceps delivery, infection)

Bell’s palsy is probably viral in origin, but the diagnosis is made by excluding
the other causes shown above. Starting prednisone (1 mg/kg body
weight/day) within 48 hours improves recovery rates. Prognosis is good;
80% of patients fully recover, although return to full function may take
months. As with other causes of facial palsy, the failure of complete eye
closure can lead to corneal ulceration, so eyedrops or lubricating gel and
an eye pad at night may be required. Refer the patient to ophthalmology.
Ramsay Hunt syndrome is due to varicella zoster infection of the facial
nerve. The features are similar to those of Bell’s palsy with the addition
of vesicles on the eardrum, ear canal, pinna, or palate. The affected ear is
often extremely painful. Hearing loss and vestibular symptoms may occur.
The prognosis is not as good as that for Bell’s palsy.
Iatrogenic injury occurs during otologic, parotid, cosmetic, and skull base
procedures. During mastoidectomy, the nerve may be injured near the
second genu and vertical segment. If transection occurs, a primary neurorrhaphy or interpositional graft should be performed immediately.
Postoperatively, if paralysis is immediately noted and nerve integrity
unclear, reexploration of the wound is necessary. If onset is delayed, it
may be observed and steroid administration considered.

PERIORBITAL CELLULITIS 1

Periorbital cellulitis
This is a serious and sight-threatening complication of ethmoidal sinusitis.
Orbital infections may extend to the orbital apex and cause blindness
and intracranial infection. The most common causative organisms include
S. pneumoniae, H. influenza, M. catarrhalis, and S. pyogenes (pediatric).
Treatment should be aimed at the underlying sinus infection, although a
multidisciplinary team of infectious disease, otolaryngologic, and ophthalmologic specialists is warranted.

Presentation
-

Preceding URI with acute sinusitis
Swelling of the upper lid and periorbital tissues
Difficulty opening the eye
Pain around the eye
Mobility of the globe and visual acuity are unaffected.

Investigations
Look for signs of more severe orbital involvement:
- Proptosis
- Pain on eye movement
- Reduced range of eye movement
- Diplopia
- Change in color vision (red goes first)
- Change in visual acuity.

Management
- Have a high index of suspicion. Obtain a CT scan of the orbits if there
is no improvement within 24 hours of starting IV antibiotics.
- Obtain an ophthalmology consultation.
- Take a middle meatal swab for culture.
- Start IV broad-spectrum antibiotics (e.g., ampicillin/sulbactam) with
good CSF penetration.
- Any compromise in visual acuity or color vision or suggestion of an
intraorbital abscess requires urgent surgical intervention.
If you are treating conservatively, ensure that regular eye observations
are performed, as these patients can progress quickly toward blindness.

Orbital complications of sinusitis
The following complications indicate advancing degrees of infection:
Group 1: Preseptal (periorbital) cellulitis
Group 2: Orbital cellulitis
Group 3: Subperiosteal abscess
Group 4: Orbital abscess
Group 5: Cavernous sinus thrombosis

CHAPTER 20

ENT emergencies

Fractured nose
Any patient with a fractured nose must have sustained a blow or an
injury to the head. Direct trauma to the nose or face is usually from a
punch, a clash of heads, or a fall. Brisk but short-lived epistaxis is common
afterwards.
In patients with a nasal fracture always consider head, cervical spine,
and adjacent facial bone injuries.

Investigations
The diagnosis is made on finding a new deformity to the nose, often with
associated epistaxis, facial swelling, and periorbital ecchymosis. Ask the
patient if their nose has changed shape as a result of their injury. In the
first few days after a nasal injury it can be difficult to assess if there is a
bony injury because of the degree of associated soft-tissue swelling.
- Try examining the patient from above and behind and looking along
the nose from bridge to tip. See Fig. 20.3.
- X-rays are not required to make the diagnosis, but they may be helpful
in excluding other bony facial fractures.
- Exclude a septal hematoma by looking for a boggy swelling of the
septum, which will cause total or near-total nasal obstruction. This will
require urgent treatment by incision and drainage.

Treatment
- Treat any head injury appropriately.
- Administer first aid for epistaxis (see p. 410).
- Consider nasal packing if the bleeding continues (see Chap 19,
pp. 392–3).
- Clean and close any overlying skin lacerations.
- Make an ENT outpatient appointment for 5–7 days’ time. By then,
much of the soft tissue swelling will have resolved, allowing assessment
of the bony injury.
- If closed reduction under anesthesia is required, it can be arranged for
7–14 days after the original injury.
- In closed reduction, the nose is packed first with decongestant
cottonoids (oxymetazoline, phenylephrine, or cocaine) and the soft
tissues around the fracture injected with anesthetic (i.e., 1% lidocaine
with epinephrine). The surgeon will elevate the impacted bone and
depress the out-fractured bone to reestablish general symmetry.
A dorsal nasal splint is then applied.
- Cartilaginous fractures, nasal tip deformities, and septal deviations are
generally not addressed during closed reduction. Septorhinoplasty may
be considered in some individuals at a later date.

CHAPTER 20

ENT emergencies

Penetrating neck injury
The otolaryngologist is often called upon to assist in the management of
penetrating trauma to the head and neck. Injuries to these areas typically
involve either stab wounds, gunshot wounds, or accidental work-related
injuries. Depending on the location and mechanism of injury, emergency
room personnel, trauma and vascular surgeons, otolaryngologists, anesthesiologists, and interventional radiologists may be summoned.

Anatomy
The neck is often divided into three zones to facilitate risk assessment
and decision making (see Fig. 20.4):
- Zone I: Root of the neck to cricoid cartilage. Vital structures include
great vessels of the neck and mediastinum, trachea, cervical esophagus,
and vertebral artery.
- Zone II: Cricoid cartilage to the angle of the mandible. Risk of injury is
to the pharynx, larynx, carotid and vertebral arteries, and jugular vein.
- Zone III: Mandibular angle to skull base. This includes carotid and
vertebral arteries, the jugular vein, and cranial nerves.

Presentation
- Injury to vasculature: hematoma, hemorrhage, neurologic deficit, shock
- Injury to the larynx or trachea: airway obstruction, stridor, hoarseness,
sucking wound, subcutaneous emphysema
- Injury to the pharyngoesophagus: subcutaneous emphysema, dysphagia,
hematemesis

Management
General principles regarding care of the traumatized patient are initiated
rapidly.
- Airway, Breathing, Circulation, Disability, and Exposure represent the
order of assessment. (See Chapter 8 for details on the emergency airway.)
- Oxygen and two large-bore IV lines
- Type and cross-match blood
- Cervical neck, lateral, and AP neck soft tissue; chest X-ray films are
obtained
Management algorithm by neck zone
Although controversy exists as to the optimal management strategy, the
following serves as a useful guide. Any patient with sustained shock or
evolving neurologic deficit should undergo immediate neck exploration.
- Zone I injury: Angiography is implemented first. If positive or patient is
symptomatic, proceed with neck exploration and laryngoscopy/
esophagoscopy.
- Zone II injury: If patient is symptomatic explore the neck. If asymptomatic, consider angiography, laryngoscopy/ esophagoscopy.
Explore the neck if guided by findings.
- Zone III injury: Angiography is usually implemented first. If positive or
patient is symptomatic, proceed with neck exploration or interventional
radiology and laryngoscopy/esophagoscopy (contrast esophagogram).

CHAPTER 20

ENT emergencies

Esophageal foreign bodies
Foreign bodies often impact in the esophagus. Most pass harmlessly, but
hazardous and potentially life-threatening complications may arise.
Commonly encountered foreign bodies include plastic objects and coins
(pediatric), bones, food products, and portions of dental prostheses
(adults).
Sharp foreign bodies carry a much higher risk of perforation. Take a
good history to establish if the patient could have ingested a bone or
something similar. These include paraesophageal abscess, mediastinitis,
airway obstruction, stricture formation, and tracheoesophageal fistula.
Ingested watch or calculator batteries may erode the esophageal wall
and must be removed without delay.

Signs and symptoms
-

Immediate onset of symptoms
Early presentation—minutes, not days
Pain—occasional retrosternal or back pain
A feeling of an obstruction in the throat
Drooling or spitting out of saliva
Point tenderness in the neck
Pain on rocking the laryngeal skeleton from side to side
Hemoptysis or hematemesis
Hoarseness—rare
Stridor—rare but serious

X-ray findings
See Fig. 19.3.
- Order a plain soft-tissue X-ray of the neck—lateral and AP views.
- Not all bones will show on X-ray, so look for soft tissue swelling in
addition to a radio-opaque object.
- Look for an air bubble in the upper esophagus.
- Look for soft tissue swelling of the posterior pharyngeal wall—more
than half a vertebral body is abnormal above C4 and more than a
whole vertebral body below C4.
- If there is prevertebral air, the esophagus has been perforated.
- Surgical emphysema is a sign of perforation.
- Loss of the normal cervical spine lordosis suggests inflammation of the
prevertebral muscles due to an impacted foreign body or an abscess.

Treatment
Endoscopic removal under GA is often required, and is mandatory if
there is any suggestion of a sharp foreign body. If the obstruction is a
soft bolus, a short period of observation is appropriate with a trial of a
carbonated drink (e.g., seltzer) and IV smooth-muscle relaxants.
Following the successful removal of a foreign body, assess for a second
foreign body and check for esophageal injury or anatomic obstruction.

CAUSTIC INGESTION 1

Caustic ingestion
The incidence of life-threatening caustic ingestion has decreased over the
past century as a result of increased awareness and proper labeling and
packaging of household agents. The vast majority of caustic ingestions
occur among poorly supervised young children, whereas suicidal attempts
and accidental adult ingestions occur less frequently.
The otolaryngologist actively participates in the diagnosis and management of caustic injuries since the upper aerodigestive tract is involved.
While most injuries are not immediately life threatening, long-term
sequelae, such as esophageal stricture, may seriously impact swallowing
function.
Ingested agents fall into two broad categories: caustic agents (alkalis)
and corrosive agents (acids). Caustic agents in the form of lye and laundry
detergents impart a liquefactive necrosis of tissues with deep penetration.
Corrosive materials cause a coagulative necrosis whose depth of penetration is limited by the coagulum. Factors that influence the degree of
injury include duration of exposure, concentration, volume consumed,
and transit time.

Signs and symptoms
-

Oral cavity and pharyngeal burns
Dysphagia
Drooling
Retrosternal or abdominal pain
Hoarseness or stridor indicate laryngeal involvement with airway
obstruction

Management
- Obtain information about agent (name of material, time of ingestion,
concentration, immediate first aid).
- Call poison control center hotline.
- Assess ABC’s (airway, breathing, circulation).
- Have patient drink water or milk to wash down material.
- Avoid lavage, induced vomiting, or neutralizing agents.
- Consider gastroesophageal endoscopy at 24–48 hours after ingestion.
- Dilute barium swallow may indicate degree of esophageal injury.
- Steroid administration and antibiotics are controversial.
- NPO until esophageal endoscopy confirms degree of injury
- Severe transmural injuries and circumferential involvement may benefit
from early esophageal resection with reconstruction.

Complications
-

Esophageal perforation with mediastinitis
Esophageal stricture
Tracheoesophageal fistula
Septic shock
Pneumonia
Gastric rupture with peritonitis

CHAPTER 20

ENT emergencies

Secondary tonsillar hemorrhage
Bleeding that occurs 5–10 days after a tonsillectomy operation is known
as a secondary tonsillar hemorrhage. (A primary hemorrhage occurs
within the first 24 hours after surgery.) A secondary hemorrhage occurs
in less than 10% of cases and may result from an infection of the tonsillar
fossa, sloughing of the eschar, or trauma. This condition should not be
underestimated and patients should be made aware of the possibility of
bleeding up to 14 days after surgery.
Common postoperative instructions are aimed at reducing the likelihood
of tonsillar bleeding. These typically include the following:
- Clear liquids for 24 hours
- Soft diet for 1–2 weeks
- Avoidance of NSAIDS, aspirin, vitamin E
- Avoidance of exercise or strenuous activity for 2 weeks

Management
-

Admit the patient for observation.
Gain intravenous access.
Give antibiotics and IV fluids.
Obtain CBC and coagulation profile.
Occasionally, cautery may be performed using silver nitrate sticks;
however, if significant blood loss occurs, surgical intervention with
electrocautery and/or suturing of the tonsillar pillars may be required.
Use of GA allows for adequate control of the airway and minimizes
aspiration.
- Once controlled, the patient should remain on clear liquids for
24 hours, then advance to soft foods.
- For mild intermittent bleeds, the patient may try gargling with cold
water and immediate follow-up in the office for silver nitrate
cauterization.

                         Splenomegaly
                         An enlarged spleen cannot usually be detected clinically
                         until it is about twice its normal size. In the early stages
                         of enlargement, the spleen can be felt just below the left
                         costal margin towards its lateral margin. Further enlarge-
                         ment causes it to project inferiorly and medially.
                         Examination for an enlarged spleen should therefore
                         begin in the right iliac fossa so as not to miss a massively
                         enlarged spleen. Begin with the hand flat on the abdomen
                         with the index finger parallel to the left costal margin.
                         Keeping the hand still ask the patient to breathe in and

Transaminases                        AST is frequently mildly elevated (2–5 times normal) in alcohol-related liver disease
                                     ALT levels may be elevated but often to a lesser degree than AST. The presence of high
                                       transaminases (>300 iU/L) is not typical of alcohol-related liver disease and should prompt
                                       investigation for other causes of liver damage

Alkaline phosphatase                 Levels are often normal or minimally elevated

Bilirubin                            Elevated bilirubin in alcohol-related liver damage is a marker of severe disease, either alcoholic

Macrocytosis                         Seen in approximately 75% of heavy drinkers irrespective of the presence of liver disease. Folate
                                       deficiency may also be present, further increasing the mean corpuscular volume

Gamma glutamyl                       Commonly elevated in heavy drinkers even in the absence of liver disease as the enzyme is
transferase (γ-GT)                     induced by alcohol. Levels return to normal within a few weeks of alcohol abstinence. Also
                                       elevated by other enzyme inducers, e.g. phenytoin

Prothrombin time                     Impaired coagulation is a marker of severe liver dysfunction

Albumin                              Levels fall in severe liver disease

IgA                                  Serum IgA levels are often elevated in patients with liver disease caused by alcohol and do not

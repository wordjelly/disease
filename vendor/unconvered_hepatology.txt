Preface

Welcome to Clinical Cases Uncovered: Hepatology. We
have tried to create a book that is informative, interesting
and relevant to everyday clinical practice. The strength of
this book, like others in the series, is that we use real
clinical cases to illustrate liver disease, highlighting the
anatomical, physiological and pathological basis behind
each case. We hope the reader will appreciate some of the
nuances of the clinical management of liver disease that
are often not documented in traditional textbooks but
which we have tried to highlight through these cases. The
cases themselves come directly from our personal clinical
practice from a variety of settings including busy district
general hospitals, teaching hospitals and liver transplant
centres. We are grateful to our previous teachers and
mentors who have inspired us and hope that we can share
their enthusiasm and wisdom with you.
Hepatology is becoming an increasingly important
part of everyday clinical practice. The incidence of liver
disease has risen at an exponential rate over the last 30

years, due to a mixture of alcohol, obesity and viral hepatitis. Most general medicine takes encounter patients
with liver disease, and every general practice will care for
several such patients.
Hepatology is not a ‘dark art’, nor is it solely a postgraduate topic, but rather it is a fascinating subject that
affects many other body systems including the heart,
lungs, kidneys and brain. The principles of successful
management of patients with acute liver disease are
common to the management of any acutely unwell
patient.
We have thoroughly enjoyed writing this book and
hope that not only will it increase your knowledge and
confidence in dealing with liver disease, but that it will
also be a highly stimulating journey.

How to use this book

Clinical Cases Uncovered (CCU) books are carefully
designed to help supplement your clinical experience and
assist with refreshing your memory when revising. Each
book is divided into three sections: Part 1, Basics; Part 2,
Cases; and Part 3, Self-assessment.
Part 1 gives you a quick reminder of the basic science,
history and examination, and key diagnoses in the area.
Part 2 contains many of the clinical presentations you
would expect to see on the wards or to crop up in exams,
with questions and answers leading you through each
case. New information, such as test results, is revealed as
events unfold and each case concludes with a handy case
summary explaining the key points. Part 3 allows you to

test your learning with several question styles (MCQs,
EMQs and SAQs), each with a strong clinical focus.
Whether reading individually or working as part of a
group, we hope you will enjoy using your CCU book. If
you have any recommendations on how we could
improve the series, please do let us know by contacting
us at: medicalstudent@wiley.co.uk.

Anatomy
The liver is the largest solid organ in the body weighing
approximately 1600 g in men and 1400 g in women. It lies
in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen under the
rib cage with its upper border between the fifth and sixth
ribs and its lower border along the right costal margin
where it can sometimes be palpated on inspiration in
healthy subjects (Fig. A).
Embryological development of the liver
To understand the anatomy and vascular relationships
of the adult liver it is first necessary to review its
development.
Hepatic parenchyma
The primitive liver develops in the 3-week-old embryo as
an outgrowth from the distal ventral wall of the foregut.
This liver bud, or hepatic diverticulum, proliferates into
solid cords of endodermal cells which invade the mesenchyme of the nearby septum transversum. A series of
branching and anastomosing plates spread between the
umbilical and vitelline veins forming a close relationship,
which eventually develops into the hepatocytes and sinusoids of the mature liver parenchyma.
Biliary system
The hepatic diverticulum divides, the large cranial part
forming the hepatic parenchyma and the smaller caudal
part forming an epithelial cord extending from the
hepatic parenchyma to the foregut, the eventual duodenum. This solid cord becomes vacuolated forming a
lumen first in the common bile duct and then in the
hepatic duct, cystic duct and gallbladder. The intrahepatic ducts begin to form from the hepatocytes in direct
contact with the mesenchyme at week 9–10. Epithelial

and mesenchymal resorption and remodelling occurs,
resulting in a network of biliary tubules. Disturbance of
this remodelling process is responsible for a number of
disorders including congenital hepatic fibrosis, Caroli’s
disease and polycystic liver disease.
Venous system
The hepatic venous system develops from four veins: two
umbilical veins carrying oxygenated blood from the placenta, and two vitelline veins draining into the sinus
venosus (Fig. B(a)). By week 7 the definitive fetal circulation is formed (Fig. B(b)):
• The right umbilical vein and the cranial portion of the
left umbilical vein regress and disappear.
• The remainder of the left umbilical vein persists providing the principal source of placental blood.
• A new vessel, the ductus venosus, develops forming a
bypass channel connecting the umbilical vein to the inferior vena cava.
• The upper anastomoses of the vitelline veins develop
into a single portal vein with left and right branches.
• The distal vitelline veins form the superior mesenteric
and splenic veins.
• At birth, blood flow ceases in the umbilical vein, the
ductus venosus closes and the portal vein takes over the
venous blood supply to the liver. The obliterated segment
of the umbilical vein between the umbilicus and the left
portal vein branch regresses to form the ligamentum teres,
and the ductus venosus becomes a fibrous cord, the ligamentum venosum, running in the right lobe (Fig. B(c)).
Gross anatomy
The liver is divided into two uneven lobes, the right and
left, by the falciform ligament, which is a remnant of the
embryonic umbilical vein. These ‘anatomical lobes’ have
no functional significance. The right lobe is larger than
the left and contains the quadrate and caudate lobes (Fig.
C(a) and(b)). Between the quadrate and caudate lobes is
the porta hepatitis or liver hilum. Here the portal vein

and hepatic artery enter and the bile ducts leave the liver.
In some individuals there is a downward protrusion of
the anterior edge of the right lobe of the liver known as
Riedel’s lobe*. It may extend into the right iliac fossa and
be palpable. It is considered as a normal variant.
Apart from an area on its posterior surface, the bare
area, the liver is covered by a fibrous capsule, Glisson’s

Liver vasculature and functional anatomy
The liver receives about a quarter of the resting cardiac
output via a dual blood supply:
• The portal vein provides approximately 75% of hepatic
blood flow. It is formed by the union of the superior
mesenteric and splenic veins and drains venous blood
from most of the digestive tract, spleen, pancreas and
gallbladder (Fig. D).
• The hepatic artery, the second major branch of the
coeliac axis, provides the remaining 25% of hepatic blood
flow, but 50% of the oxygen supply. The hepatic arteries
give rise to branches that supply the biliary epithelium,
thus obstruction to arterial flow can result in the development of an ischaemic cholangitis.
The distribution of the hepatic blood supply and
biliary drainage divides the liver functionally into two
roughly equal ‘physiological lobes’. The line of demarcation between right and left vascular inflow passes along

diaphragm and is surrounded by reflections of peritoneum. The falciform ligament attaches the liver to the
diaphragm and anterior abdominal wall. Its anterior
portion, the round ligament (ligamentum teres), connects the left branch of the portal vein to the umbilicus.
It contains small vestigial veins that can reopen and
become varicose if intrahepatic portal venous hypertension develops.

a plane joining the tip of the gallbladder to the groove of
the inferior vena cava (see Fig. C(a)). The understanding
of this vascular anatomy and the recognition of true right
and left lobes is of major importance in radiologically
staging hepatic tumours and in surgical resection of the
liver.
The liver is drained by three major veins, the right,
middle and left hepatic veins. As they emerge from the
posterior surface of the liver the left and middle veins
usually join, forming a common trunk that drains alongside the right hepatic vein into the inferior vena cava just
before it passes through the diaphragm. In addition to
the main hepatic veins, small inferior veins drain the
posterior segment of the right lobe and the caudate lobe
directly into the vena cava. This arrangement protects the
caudate lobe from injury and allows it to hypertrophy if
the main hepatic veins are occluded (Budd–Chiari
syndrome).
Biliary drainage
Within the hepatic parenchyma bile canaliculi form an
anastomosing network between the hepatocytes. They
join near the portal tracts and form progressively larger
ducts, eventually creating right and left hepatic ducts
which leave the right and left liver lobes, respectively. The
hepatic ducts meet at the porta hepatis and unite, forming
the common hepatic duct. The gallbladder lies under the
right lobe of the liver where it stores and concentrates
bile. It is drained by the cystic duct, which joins the
common hepatic duct to form the common bile duct.
The common bile duct runs behind the first part of the
duodenum in the groove on the back of the head of the
pancreas and enters the second part of the duodenum,
usually joining the main pancreatic duct to form a
common channel, the ampulla of Vater (Fig. E). The
lower end of the common bile duct contains the muscular sphincter of Oddi which prevents bile entering the
duodenum in the fasting state. In about 30% of individuals, the bile duct and pancreatic duct open separately into
the duodenum.
Intrahepatic organisation
The hepatic artery and portal vein enter the porta hepatitis within a sheath of connective tissue, the gastroduodenal ligament, which also contains bile duct branches as
they leave the liver. The vessels run parallel and branch
in all directions eventually emptying into the hepatic
sinusoids. Blood passes from the portal tract via the
hepatic sinusoids to the terminal vein (central vein). The

hepatic veins run in the opposite direction to the portal
tract with terminal hepatic venules collecting blood from
the sinusoids and forming larger channels leading to the
main hepatic veins.
Two models have been proposed for the functional
unit of the liver (Figs F and G):
1 The classic lobule (Fig. F) is a hexagonal structure
organised around a central venule, a tributary of the
hepatic vein, with the portal tracts forming the corners
of the hexagon. This model is convenient for describing
centrilobular or perilobular structural alterations occurring around the hepatic venule or portal tracts, respectively, but it is not an isolated functional unit.
2 The liver acinus (Fig. G) more accurately describes the
functional unit of the liver and describes the hepatic
parenchyma in zones:
• Hepatocytes in zone 1 are closest to the portal triad;
they receive the richest supply of oxygen and nutrients
but are more likely to be damaged by drugs and toxins
as they are exposed to higher concentrations of these.
• Zone 3 hepatocytes are near the central vein and
have a relatively poor oxygen supply and are therefore
particularly susceptible to hypoxic damage.
Tissues of the liver
Hepatocytes

soidal endothelial cells and the hepatocytes (Fig. H). This
space of Disse contains perisinusoidal cells, the hepatic
stellate cells also known as Ito cells. These are multifunctional cells involved in fat and vitamin storage and with
the potential to transform into fibroblasts, which are a
major source of extracellular matrix in the normal and
diseased liver. Kupffer cells float freely in the lumen of
the sinusoids. They are members of the mononuclear
phagocytic system and are responsible for the clearance
of particles, injured red cells and toxins. Liver-associated
lymphocytes can be recruited from the peripheral blood
to the liver sinusoids where they mature and acquire
natural and lymphokine-activated cell activity.

Lymphatics
Hepatic lymph is formed by drainage of the perisinusoidal space of Disse into lymphatic plexuses of the portal
tract. The lymphatic plexuses progressively enlarge as
they follow the portal vessels to the portal hepatitis, and
the majority drain into hepatic lymph nodes at the liver
hilum. Other drainage routes occur via the falciform ligament and epigastric vessels to the parasternal nodes, from
the liver surface to the left gastric nodes and from the
bare area to the posterior mediastinal nodes.
Nerve supply
Nerve plexuses around the hepatic artery and portal vein
provide parasympathetic fibres from the vagus nerve and
sympathetic fibres from the coeliac ganglia.

Bile formation and excretion
Bile secretion is an important exocrine function of the
liver. Bile is a mixture of water, electrolytes, bile pigments
(largely bilirubin), bile acids, cholesterol, phospholipids,
albumin and immunoglobulins. This composition allows
it to have a broad range of physiological functions including lipid digestion and absorption, immunological
defence, excretion of endogenous compounds and
removal of xenobiotics.

cells are arranged in plates with the basolateral surface
projecting into the perisinusoidal space of Disse where
they are in direct contact with cell-free blood.
Cholangiocytes
The bile ducts are composed of epithelial cells, called
cholangiocytes. The cells lining the small interlobular
ducts are cuboidal, whereas those of the larger bile ducts
are columnar, mucus-secreting cells.
Cells of the sinusoid
The vascular sinusoids are lined by endothelial cells that
contain numerous fenestrae allowing free passage of
solutes into the space of Disse that lies between the sinu-

Formation of bilirubin
The body produces approximately 250–400 mg of
bilirubin daily, primarily from the breakdown of
haemoglobin:
• Haem is enzymatically degraded releasing iron, carbon
monoxide and biliverdin (green), which is subsequently
reduced to bilirubin (yellow) by the enzyme biliverdin
reductase.

unconjugated bilirubin is water insoluble
and therefore circulates in plasma tightly bound to
albumin.
• Conjugation of bilirubin with glucoronic acid occurs
in hepatocytes and confers water solubility, allowing efficient excretion in the bile (Fig. I).
• Following conjugation, the major bilirubin pigment is
bilirubin diglucoronide; bilirubin monoglucoronide and
unconjugated bilirubin account for less than 20% of the
pigments.
• Conjugated bilirubin is transported from the hepatocyte to the biliary canaliculus by an adenosine triphosphate (ATP) dependent export pump.
A number of inherited conditions are caused by defects
in the process of bilirubin conjugation and excretion
from the liver (Table A).

Enterohepatic circulation

Conjugated bilirubin is water soluble and therefore there
is little reabsorption in the small intestine. In the colon,

Basic science 7

bacterial glucoronidases hydrolyse conjugated bilirubin,
forming urobilinogen, a non-polar substance that is
reabsorbed in the intestine. This is re-excreted in the bile
(major fraction) or urine (minor fraction). Although

urobilinogen is colourless, its oxidised product urobilin
contributes to the colour of stool and urine (Fig. J).
Urobilinogen is further converted to stercobilin in the colon.

because there is excess conjugated bilirubin in the blood
which is water soluble and therefore passes through the
renal glomerular filter into the urine (Fig. K).

the liver is also affected, resulting in increased excretion
in the urine.

Bile acids
Bile acids are synthesised in the liver from cholesterol.
They are conjugated in the liver with amino acids (glycine
or taurine) to form bile salts, which are excreted in bile.
In the intestine bile salts are reabsorbed in the terminal
ileum. The small fraction that enters the colon is converted to secondary bile salts by the action of colonic
bacteria, which then enters the enterohepatic circulation.
There are a number of functions of bile acids/salts:
• Contribution to secretion of cholesterol and phospholipids from the liver.
• Major solute of bile and contributes to bile flow.
• Allows excretion of lipid-soluble substances by forming
micelles.
• Absorption and digestion of lipids, including lipidsoluble vitamins.
• Signalling properties in the hepatocyte and biliary epithelium (e.g. regulate expression of genes responsible for
bile synthesis and metabolism).
Clinical implications of bile acids
• In biliary obstruction a reduction in bile salt excretion

may cause deficiencies in the absorption of fat-soluble
vitamins (A, D, E and K). In the context of liver disease,
this may result in prolonged coagulation because of the
resulting low levels of vitamin K.
• Disease or resection of the terminal ileum interrupts
the normal enterohepatic circulation of bile salts. The
increased delivery of bile salts to the colon may cause
diarrhoea and result in electrolyte and water loss in the
faeces.

Gallbladder function
The principle functions of the gallbladder are the storage
and concentration of bile. In response to neurological
reflexes and the gut hormone cholecystokinin (CCK) it
contracts to release bile in the duodenum. Although it is
not essential for bile secretion, it concentrates bile by up
to 10-fold and patients who have had their gallbladder
removed may develop upper gastrointestinal symptoms
such as oesophagitis or gastritis related to the continuous
flow of bile into the gut.
Central metabolic functions of the liver
The liver is a central hub for the metabolism of carbohydrates, protein and lipids. Within the sinusoid there
are zones where different metabolic processes are
concentrated.

Glucose metabolism
The liver has a pivotal role in glucose homeostasis.
Following a meal approximately 25% of the glucose
content is metabolised in the liver – stored as glycogen,
oxidised or converted to fat. The liver maintains plasma
blood glucose levels by two distinct pathways, gluconeogensis (converts carbon-containing compounds such as
amino acids into glucose) and glycogenolysis (conversion
of glycogen into glucose).
• The homeostasis between glucose storage and glucose
production is relative to the concentrations of the hormones insulin (produced in pancreatic β cells) and
glucagon (produced in pancreatic alpha cells).
• A raised insulin : glucagon ratio inhibits gluconeogensis and promotes glycogen synthesis.
• A reduced insulin : glucagon ratio promotes gluconeogenesis and inhibits glycogen synthesis.

Part 1: Basics

Protein and amino acid metabolism

• Chylomicrons, very low density lipoproteins (VLDLs),

The liver has diverse functions pertaining to protein
metabolism, including:
• The synthesis and degradation of amino acids and proteins including albumin, globulin and fibrinogen.
• The production of ammonia from the deamination of
amino acids and subsequent conversion to urea (via the
intermediates ornithine, citruline and arginine) by the
urea cycle, which occurs exclusively in the liver.
• The production of glucose from the main ‘gluconeogenic’ amino acids alanine and glutamine.
• The production of fatty acids from ‘ketogenic’ amino
acids, e.g. leucine and lysine.
• The formation of glutathione (important antioxidant
role) and creatine (an important energy source in skeletal
muscle which spontaneously breaks down to creatinine),
which is dependent upon amino acid metabolism within
the liver.

low density lipoproteins (LDLs) and high density lipoproteins (HDLs) are all part of the apolipoprotein family.
• With increasing density, there is reducing size, reduced
cholesterol content and increased protein content of the
particles.
• Lipids are transported from the intestine to the liver in
chylomicrons.
• The liver exports fatty acids as VLDLs, which releases
free fatty acids by the action of peripheral lipoprotein
lipases.
• LDLs are taken up by target tissues by endocytosis or
by LDL-receptor-mediated uptake in the liver.
• HDLs transport cholesterol back to the liver for elimination (Fig. L).
• Cholesterol within the liver is excreted as bile salts (see
above).

Clinical implications of disordered metabolism in
liver disease

Lipid metabolism
Cholesterol degradation and excretion is dependent on
the liver. Due to their insolubility, the transport of cholesterol and triglycerides is reliant on lipoproteins
(Fig. L).

• Glycogen storage diseases are inherited disorders

caused by deficiency of enzymes that catalyse the conversion of glycogen and glucose. In the hepatic forms this
can result in hypoglycaemia, hepatomegaly (due to excess
glycogen in the liver) and growth retardation.
• In severe acute liver failure, hypoglycaemia occurs
because of the inability of the liver to maintain plasma
glucose by either gluconeogenesis or glycogenolysis.
• In cirrhosis there may be a combination of reduced
glycogen reserves (less glycogenolysis), which is compensated for by increased gluconeogenesis.
• Insulin resistance, altered carbohydrate and lipid
metabolism (resulting in increased free fatty acid efflux
into the liver) and inflammatory cytokines contribute to
the condition of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).
• Reduced muscle mass in chronic liver disease is a
reflection of reduced nutritional intake but also increased
catabolism (may reflect increased proteolysis for the provision of gluconeogenic amino acids).
• The inability of the liver to adequately metabolise
ammonia (because of increased portosystemic shunting
and reduced elimination in the urea cycle) may have an
important aetiological role in the development of hepatic
encephalopathy.

Drug metabolism
The liver plays a major role in drug metabolism and
elimination. Drugs are taken up by the liver and then
processed by a number of enzymatic reactions:

Basic science 11

Liver disease can affect drug metabolism in a number of
ways. Firstly, portosystemic shunting will reduce metabolism of drugs within the liver and, secondly, reduced
albumin synthesis will alter the ratio of unbound : bound
drug in the plasma.
Immune function
The vascular supply through the liver and the arrival of
potentially pathogenic substances, via the portal vein
from the gut, makes the liver an important immunological site. The liver has diverse immune functions:
• Kupffer cells are resident macrophages located in the
hepatic sinusoids. They have important roles in phagocytosis, cytokine and chemokine release and activation of
other cells including the hepatic stellate cell.
• In addition to the trafficking of activated lymphocytes
from the circulation into the liver there is also a specific
intrahepatic population of lymphocytes, natural killer
cells (part of the innate immune system) and dendritic
cells (which present antigen to T cells).
• Immune tolerance may have particular relevance for
the liver in view of the high antigenic load it receives from
the gut. There is a balance of protecting against excessive
immune activation (e.g. autoimmunity) versus allowing
the persistence of pathogens (chronic viral hepatitis).
• Secretory IgA in the bile contributes to hepatobiliary
and gastrointestinal mucosal immunity. Raised serum
levels of IgA are found in alcoholic liver disease; the exact
reason is uncertain but there is some evidence that
alcohol can disrupt the gastrointestinal epithelial barrier
resulting in greater antigen translocation across the gut.

Pathophysiological processes affecting
the liver
Acute inflammation
The causes of acute hepatitis are broad (Box A). Damage
may occur by hepatocellular necrosis or apoptosis (pro-

grammed cell death). The liver injury can result in
asymptomatic transaminitis (deranged liver function
tests but no clinical signs or symptoms), anicteric hepatitis (no jaundice but symptoms such as fever, vomiting,
right upper quadrant discomfort, etc.), icteric hepatitis
(jaundice but no encephalopathy) or fulminant liver
failure (coagulopathy and hepatic encephalopathy). The
liver has a remarkable capacity for regeneration and the
balance of this regeneration versus injury will determine
the outcome:
• Acute hepatitis with complete resolution.
• Fulminant liver failure.
• Chronic liver injury leading to fibrosis.
Acute liver failure
The term acute liver failure implies the presence of
encephalopathy in the context of an acute liver injury.
The following classification is often used:
• Hyperacute liver failure: encephalopathy within 7 days
of jaundice.
• Acute liver failure: encephalopathy between 8 and 28
days after the onset of jaundice.
• Subacute liver failure: encephalopathy between 5 and
12 weeks after the onset of jaundice.
Inadequate liver function results in reduced hepatic
metabolism of ammonia and contributes to the development of encephalopathy. The resulting excessive
ammonia is metabolised in the brain causing

1 Phase 1 metabolism alters the structural integrity of
the drug by enzymes, including the cytochrome P450
system. The resultant metabolite is not necessarily detoxified and may in fact be more active (e.g. the metabolite
N-acetyl-p-benzoquionimine (NAPQI) produced by
phase I metabolism of paracetamol is hepatotoxic). The
efficacy of this system is determined by genetic factors
and also induction by other drugs.
2 Phase 2 metabolism results in conjugation of the
metabolite, which can detoxify and increase solubility for
excretion.

accumulation of glutamine in astrocytes, raised cellular
osmotic pressure and cerebral oedema. Oedema is further
accentuated by an increase in cerebral blood flow due to
disruption of the normal autoregulatory mechanisms. If
the intracranial pressure becomes elevated above a critical threshold cerebral perfusion may be compromised
and brainstem herniation can occur.
In addition to encephalopathy other clinical manifestations include renal dysfunction, hyperdynamic circulation (increased cardiac output and reduced systemic
vascular resistance), hyperventilation, prolonged
coagulation, sepsis (including fungal infections) and
hypoglycaemia.
Chronic liver injury, fibrosis and cirrhosis
Chronic liver injury can result from a spectrum of insults
(Table C) and frequently leads to fibrosis, an innate
wound healing response of the body. Fibrosis usually

takes several years to develop but can occasionally
develop rapidly over months (e.g childhood biliary
atresia, certain drug-induced liver diseases and the post
liver transplantation setting). Liver fibrosis is characterised by the deposition of extracellular matrix (scar tissue)
consisting of collagens, hyaluronic acid, proteoglycans
and matrix glycoproteins. The hepatic stellate cell, residing in the space of Disse within the sinusoids, plays a
central role in secreting collagen scar tissue. Progressive
injury eventually leads to the formation of fibrous tissue
bands separating nodules of regenerative hepatocytes,
when it is known as cirrhosis. Cirrhosis may be defined
as micronodular (small nodules less than 3 mm) or
macronodular (Fig. M).
The development of cirrhosis alters haemodynamics
within and outside the liver. Extracellular matrix deposition within the sinusoids causes a loss of the normal
fenestration (analogous to changing from a porous pipe

to a lead pipe) and subsequent reduced filtration and
hypoxia. Furthermore, the release of angiogenic factors
stimulates new blood vessel formation (neoangiogenesis)
within the fibrous tissue. The resulting intrahepatic
shunting of blood contributes to the reduction in hepatic
function that occurs in advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis.
The vascular resistance in the liver increases due to a
combination of structural alterations (e.g. scar tissue and
nodules) and dynamic alterations (e.g. contraction of the
hepatic stellate cell) in the liver parenchyma. The rise in
intrahepatic vascular resistance contributes to the elevation in portal venous pressure that frequently complicates cirrhosis.
Regeneration
The human liver is the only organ able to regenerate lost
tissue. A whole liver can regenerate from as little as 25%
of its normal size. The mechanisms are not entirely clear
but probably involve hepatocytes entering cell cycle in
response to signals including growth factors and
cytokines. There is also evidence for bipotential stem cells
(oval cells) that can differentiate into either hepatocytes
or cholangiocytes. Once a liver has become chronically
damaged and has developed extensive fibrosis its ability
to regenerate becomes impaired, an important fact in
selecting patients for surgical resection.
Neoplasia
Neoplasia is the abnormal proliferation of cells. It results
when a cell becomes genetically altered so that it evades
the normal controls on growth and proliferation. A neoplasm may be benign (e.g. adenoma) or malignant, when

it is frequently called a cancer. Malignant neoplasms may
invade and destroy surrounding tissues, they can spread
(metastasise) and may kill the host. The liver is a frequent
site of spread from other neoplasms, particularly those of
the gastrointestinal tract and pancreas, which are drained
by the portal venous system. Hepatic metastases may be
solitary or multiple. Neoplasms relevant to the hepatobiliary system are demonstrated in Fig. N.
Multiple mechanisms are responsible for the genetic
changes that occur in neoplasia. Eighty per cent of hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) occur on a background of
cirrhosis, probably because the repeated cycles of inflammation, oxidative damage and repair result in genetic
damage that predisposes to malignant change. Hepatitis B
virus causes HCC by inducing cirrhosis but can also cause
HCC in non-cirrhotic livers, which may be secondary to
its ability to integrate into host cellular DNA. Risk factors
for developing the commonest malignant neoplasms,
HCC and cholangiocarcinoma, are shown in Box B.
The site of the neoplasm determines the characteristic
of the disease presentation. For example, lesions in the
biliary system frequently cause obstruction and present
with jaundice, whereas lesions in the liver parenchyma
rarely cause jaundice until late stages and are only picked
up when disease is advanced unless they are detected
incidentally or as a result of screening. Consequently, the
prognosis of hepatobiliary malignant neoplasms is frequently poor.
Infection
Infection occurs when a microorganism enters a host and
replicates there. Disease results when the microorganism

causes damage to the host during the process of infection.
The liver is frequently involved in infection, either as the
primary target organ or as part of a generalised multiorgan process. The portal venous circulation and the biliary
tract provide potential routes for infectious agents to
access the liver from the gastrointestinal tract. In addition, the rich vascular supply to the liver results in it
being susceptible to infection as a consequence of systemic infections. Many different classes of microorganism can result in hepatic infection (Table D).

Clinical impact of infection
The clinical impact of hepatic infection is determined by
a number of factors including the site of infection, the
mechanism by which the organism causes damage and
the extent of the host’s response to the invading
organism.

Site of infection
The clinical features of hepatic infection are determined
by the site of infection.
Liver parenchyma
• Hepatitis: Hepatitis is the term given for inflammation
of the liver parenchyma; infection, in particular viral
infection, is an important cause. Viruses may cause hepatitis as a primary manifestation of infection (e.g. hepatitis
A to E) or as part of a more generalised systemic infection
(e.g. cytomegalovirus, Ebstein–Barr virus, herpes simplex
virus). Infectious hepatitis results in a spectrum of clinical syndromes ranging from subclinical infection, to
clinical infection with or without jaundice, to acute liver
failure with possible death (rare).
• Abscess: Abscesses in the liver are most frequently
caused by bacteria, although amoebic abscesses may be
seen in travellers to endemic areas and fungal abscesses

can occur in the immunocompromised. Typical symptoms are malaise, anorexia, fever and right upper quadrant discomfort.
• Tuberculosis: Liver involvement in tuberculosis (TB)
is common, histological abnormalities being seen in up
to 75% of patients with pulmonary TB as a consequence
of haematogenous spread from the primary source.
Diffuse parenchymal hepatic TB is the most common
form, characterised by small (<1 mm) granulomas
throughout the liver parenchyma. Less commonly, focal
hepatic TB occurs with a tuberculous liver abscess or
tuberculoma. These lesions are usually larger (>2 mm)
and may be solitary or multiple.
Biliary system
• Cholangitis: Cholangitis is the result of infection

within the biliary system. It frequently occurs when there
is obstruction to biliary drainage, for example by impaction of a gallstone in the bile duct, with ascending infection behind the obstruction. Cholangitis may also occur
as a complication of surgery or endoscopic instrumentation of the biliary tract (e.g. endoscopic retrograde
cholangiopancreatography (ERCP)). The invading
microorganisms arise from the gastrointestinal tract (e.g.
Escherichia coli). Spread of the microorganisms into the
liver parenchyma may occur with development of hepatic
abscesses. Patients with ascending cholangitis typically
present with fever, jaundice and right upper quadrant
pain (Charcot’s triad*).
• Gallbladder empyema: Bacterial contamination of
the gallbladder may result in production of a purulent
inflammatory exudate resulting in a gallbladder

*Jean-Martin Charcot (1825–1893), French neurologist.

empyema. This usually results from obstruction of the
cystic duct, typically by gallstones. The patient is unwell
and requires antibiotics and urgent drainage or removal
of the gallbladder.
• Parasitic infection: Some parasites can infect the biliary
system in humans. Fasciola hepatica is a sheep fluke found
in parts of Europe including England. Flukes hatch in the
small intestine, penetrate the intestinal wall, cross the
peritoneal cavity and enter the hepatic parenchyma, eventually reaching the biliary tree. Here mature worms
produce eggs in the bile duct, which enter the small intestine and are passed from the body in faeces. Infection
may be asymptomatic or may mimic ascending cholangitis. Tapeworms of the Echinococcus genus can infect the
liver. Humans become infected by ingesting eggs that
hatch in the intestine and migrate to the liver and other
organs. Large complex cysts (hydatid cysts) can form in
the liver which may be asymptomatic or cause symptoms
related to pressure. Clonorchis sinensis is a liver fluke most
commonly seen in Asia. The adult flukes live in the bile
ducts and release eggs that can result in severe inflammation and fibrosis. Infestation with this parasite has been
linked to the development of cholangiocarcinoma.
Blood vessels
Schistosomiasis (bilharzia). Schistosoma mansoni and
S. japonica cause liver disease. Cercariae from infected
water enter humans by penetrating unbroken skin. They
migrate through the venous system to the liver and
mesenteric veins where the adult worms mature and
produce eggs. Eggs retained in the mesenteric vessels
produce intense inflammation and fibrosis. Hepatic schistosomiasis results in fibrosis around the portal veins and
a granulomatous inflammation within the hepatic parenchyma. Patients are not cirrhotic but the severe periportal

fibrosis leads to portal hypertension and subsequent
development of splenomegaly, ascites and varices.

necrosis occurs and the liver fails; fortunately this is very
rare.

Mechanisms of disease

Immunosuppression

Disease may result from direct damage caused by the invading microorganism itself or indirectly via the host’s response
to the microorganism, or a combination of the two.

Despite the fact that the immune system is responsible
for a large component of the injury caused by viruses
such as hepatitis B and C, these viruses actually cause
more damage if the patient is immunosuppressed, for
example in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and following liver transplantation. In this situation
it seems that the virus is capable of directly damaging
hepatocytes, illustrating the fact that it is the complex
interplay between both the virus and the host response
to it that dictates the pathology caused.
Immunosuppression also increases the likelihood of
opportunistic infections. Fungal infections such as with
Candida are rarely seen in those with an intact immune
system but may occur in patients who are immunosuppressed. Other infections such as mycobacterial
infections (Mycobacterium tuberculosis, M. aviumintracellulare, M. kansaii) and Pneumocystis carinii infection of the liver may be seen in those with a severely
compromised immune system.

Direct damage
Only a few organisms cause hepatic disease by directly
damaging the host. Some of the viruses that cause haemorrhagic fevers (e.g. yellow fever or Rift Valley fever) can
cause direct hepatocyte necrosis. As a part of a multisystem illness these viruses diffusely infect hepatocytes
which are destroyed by the replicating virus, resulting in
death in up to 50% of cases. Hepatitis viruses may in
some circumstances cause disease by a direct cytopathic
effect but the main mechanism of disease is by indirect
damage (see below).
Indirect damage
• Inflammation: The presence of microorganisms in
tissues frequently elicits an inflammatory reaction as part
of the host response to attempt to destroy and eradicate
the invading organism. Often this inflammation itself
leads to damage that produces disease. An example of this
is the inflammatory response to schistosomal eggs mentioned above. The presence of the eggs in the portal
vessels induces a granulomatous inflammatory reaction
which eventually results in healing by fibrosis. Disease is
then caused by the fibrotic narrowing of the portal
vessels, resulting in portal hypertension.
• Immune response: Hepatitis viruses classically cause
disease by inducing an immune response. The extent and
severity of the disease is related to the strength of the
immune response to the virus and varies considerably
between individuals. This is best illustrated by hepatitis
B virus (HBV) infection. Infection acquired as a neonate,
when the immune system is immature, almost invariably
results in chronic carriage of the virus. Individuals have
high levels of viraemia but remain well with normal liver
blood tests and normal liver histology. Individuals who
acquire HBV infection as an adult, however, may have a
more developed immunological response and develop
symptomatic hepatitis. Liver blood tests may be abnormal and biopsy reveals hepatocyte necrosis with lymphocyte infiltration of the liver parenchyma. In the most
extreme example of symptomatic hepatitis B infection,
the immune response is so intense that total hepatocyte

The liver and systemic infection

Infection in liver failure
The liver is a key component of the host immune response
to infection. It produces many of the proteins involved
in the innate response against infection, e.g. proteins of
the complement cascade. In addition it contains a resident macrophage population, the Kupffer cells, which
play a significant role in the removal of toxins and foreign
substances from the portal blood. Severe hepatic injury,
either in acute liver failure or in cirrhosis, results in
impairment of these hepatic defences. This leads to an
increased susceptibility of the host to infections, particularly bacterial and fungal infections. Infection can occur
anywhere but is frequently cultured from blood, urine
and sputum. A common and clinically important
example is spontaneous infection of ascites from bacteria
translocating across the gastrointestinal lumen (spontaneous bacterial peritonitis).

Sepsis-related change in liver function
Infection in extrahepatic sites can produce changes in
liver function. Hepatic dysfunction has many causes
including hypoxia and decreased hepatic perfusion seen
in systemic sepsis and release of cytokines and free radicals by activated Kupffer cells.

Drug toxicity
Many drugs in common use can cause toxic effects on
the liver ranging from mild subclinical reactions to fulminant hepatic failure. Patients frequently take multiple
drugs which can make it difficult to identify the hepatotoxic agent. A careful history including dose, route of
administration, duration of use and concomitant medication must be taken. As well as enquiring about prescribed medications (current and in the past 3 months),
it is also important to consider herbal and over the
counter medications which are frequently implicated in
drug-induced liver disease. Risk factors for drug-induced
liver injury are given in Box C.
Mechanisms of hepatotoxicity
• Some drugs produce liver injury in a predictable, dose-

dependent manner in most individuals (e.g. paracetamol
excess). The injury characteristically affects one area of
the liver lobule, for example paracetamol causes zone 3
or centrilobular necrosis. The damage is frequently not
caused by the drug itself but by a toxic effect of a reactive

Box C Risk factors for hepatic drug injury

䊊 reduction in hepatic blood flow with decreased
first-pass metabolism
䊊 impaired oxidative metabolism and glucuronidation
䊊 reduced albumin synthesis altering the ratio of
unbound : bound drug in the plasma
• Age: older age increases the risk of hepatotoxicity due
to:

䊊 reduced renal clearance
• Sex: some drug reactions are more common in females
(e.g. nitrofurantoin and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
drugs)

metabolite causing oxidative damage to cellular proteins
and nucleic acids and disrupting their function.
• Other drugs result in unpredictable or idiosyncratic
liver injury that is not dose dependent (e.g. isoniazid).
The liver injury is more diffuse, affecting the whole liver
lobule. Immunological mechanisms may be involved
including a hypersensitivity reaction that develops after
1–4 weeks and is characterised by fever, rash, eosinophilia
and lymphocytosis. This may be a result of alterations in
endogenous proteins, by binding of the drug or its
metabolites, which then provoke an autoimmune
response. Some may develop autoantibodies. Withdrawing the drug may terminate this response but
in some cases a chronic autoimmune hepatitis may
develop. The reaction recurs quickly if the drug is
readministered.
Patterns of drug-induced hepatotoxicity
There are many patterns of drug-induced injury (Table
E). Two main categories are commonly found:
• Hepatocellular damage: Damage to the hepatocyte
may be acute or chronic. The types of injury vary including necrosis, steatosis and non-specific hepatitis, which

may resemble autoimmune hepatitis or a granulomatous
hepatitis.
• Cholestatic damage: Intrahepatic cholestasis is a
common manifestation of drug-induced liver injury.
Symptoms may mimic extrahepatic biliary obstruction
but there is an absence of duct dilatation on ultrasound
imaging. Histology may reveal evidence of inflammation
in the portal regions which can be accompanied by
destruction and loss of bile ducts.
Clinical features of drug-induced liver injury
and management
Symptoms are generally non-specific, making diagnosis
difficult and a high index of suspicion required to diagnose drug-induced liver injury. Many drugs cause an
illness similar to viral hepatitis with a prodrome of
nausea and anorexia followed by abdominal pain and
jaundice. Drugs that cause hypersensitivity reactions may
cause fever, rash and arthralgia.
Diagnosis may be difficult since the clinical symptoms
and any changes in laboratory indices are non-specific.
Often the diagnosis is suspected merely because the
patient improves when the drug is discontinued; however,
some drug-related injuries continue to deteriorate
despite drug withdrawal. Furthermore, patients are often
on multiple drugs and have serious underlying illnesses
making it difficult to identify the cause of liver injury.
The key component to making a diagnosis is a careful
and thorough history of recent and past drug exposure
including non-prescribed medications.
The main treatment is withdrawal of the injurious
agent and supportive care for symptoms such as pruritus.
Most patients will recover completely although a few
continue to deteriorate, and in some liver transplantation
may ultimately be necessary.
Vascular pathophysiology in liver disease

Hepatic ischaemia
The liver has a dual blood supply with approximately
70–80% of blood flow derived from the portal vein and
the remainder from the hepatic artery. Therefore the liver
is relatively well protected from ischaemia due to systemic hypotension. However, the combination of hepatic
congestion and hypotension can provoke hepatic ischaemia. The most common scenario for this to occur is in
cardiac patients, where longstanding cardiac failure
causes hepatic congestion, and who then have an acute
hypotensive episode; in essence there is ‘forward failure’
and ‘backward congestion’. Hypoxia or anaemia will
further aggravate hepatic ischaemia.

• Acute hepatic ischaemia may be asymptomatic and

associated with a large increase in transaminases (can
approach 1000 iU/L) and reduced synthetic function. In
the majority of cases this will resolve with conservative
treatment within 7 days but in a small proportion of cases
acute liver failure may ensue.
• In chronic cardiac congestion liver cirrhosis may
result. The resulting congestion in the centilobular region
and sinusoidal dilatation leads to the ‘nutmeg’ appearance seen at autopsy.

Portal hypertension and haemodynamics
in cirrhosis
Portal hypertension is defined by an elevated portal pressure greater than the normal value of 1–5 mmHg. In
general, portal pressure becomes clinically significant
above a level of 12 mmHg. The major complications of
portal hypertension include ascites, gastrointestinal
haemorrhage and renal dysfunction. Of these, gastroin-

Box D The haemodynamics of liver cirrhosis
• Reduced blood pressure and increased heart rate:
䊊 low blood pressure due to reduced resistance of the
peripheral circulation (systemic vascular resistance)
䊊 cardiac output and pulse rate may rise in early
cirrhosis due to activation of the sympathetic nervous
system
• Increased total blood volume but reduced central blood
volume:
䊊 increased renal water and sodium retention
䊊 increased ADH release
䊊 splanchnic arterial vasodilatation results in pooling of
blood in the splanchnic circulation
• Reduced renal blood flow:

• Hepatic venous pressure gradient:

hepatic venous pressure gradient and is the pressure
difference between the hepatic vein and portal vein.
In cirrhosis, there is a relationship between this
gradient and the development of complications, e.g.
bleeding from varices

blood flow within the liver

cirrhosis, as outlined in Box D, and this underpins many
of the complications of portal hypertension. Overall
there is increased sodium and water, but the fluid is in
the ‘wrong compartment’ and the homeostatic mechanisms the body employs to correct this, e.g activation of
the rennin–angiotensin system, exacerbates the vicious
cycle of events.

testinal haemorrhage is the most dramatic and occurs
frequently. Prospective studies suggest that 90% of
patients with cirrhosis will develop oesophageal varices
and a third of these will bleed. Ascites can occur insidiously and it is associated with a 2-year survival of 50%;
therefore it represents a landmark event in the evolution
of cirrhosis. The normal haemodynamics are altered in

Approach to the patient

History
Except for patients who are extremely ill, the taking of a
thorough and careful medical history should precede
examination and treatment. An accurate history will
often suggest the correct diagnosis and determine what
investigations are necessary. It is important to remember
that the individual consulting a doctor may be nervous
and apprehensive, so it is essential they are put at ease by
a friendly greeting and made to feel the centre of the
interviewer’s interest.
Begin the interview by introducing yourself, giving
your name and position and asking consent to take a
history. Ask open questions and allow patients adequate
opportunity to answer in their own words as this is more
likely to direct you to the patient’s underlying concerns
rather than what you perceive their problem to be. Once
you have allowed the patient to give their own account
of their problems it may be necessary to ask a series of
direct questions to clarify the patient’s account and to
extract further information regarding their previous
health, family history and social matters.
Presenting complaint
The history begins with asking about the patient’s main
complaint. Begin with an open question such as ‘What is
the main problem with your health?’ or ‘When were you
last completely well?’ Patients may have more than one
presenting complaint. Record each presenting symptom
in their own words rather than using medical interpretations of what was said. It is important to be sure you
know what the patient means since their interpretation
of medical terms may be different to yours. For instance,
a patient reporting a stomach ache may not be referring
to a problem in the upper gastrointestinal tract and could
be describing a sensation anywhere in the abdomen from

the suprapubic region to epigastrium. Common hepatology presentations are given in Box E.
History of presenting symptom
After eliciting a patient’s presenting complaint or complaints you should take a careful history of each one,
establishing:
• The mode and time of onset.
• Progression of the symptom.
• Associated symptoms.
• The effect the symptom has on the patient’s life.
In order to obtain this information it is necessary to
combine a series of open and directed questions. Success
in achieving this requires a lot of practice that can only
be obtained by spending time talking to patients.

Jaundice
Jaundice refers to the yellow discolouration of the sclera
or skin. It is caused by the presence of excess bilirubin in
the blood, which is deposited in tissues of the body, particularly those that contain elastin. It is usually seen first
in the sclerae, which are rich in elastic fibres, and in
patients with dark skin this may be the only site that it
can be recognised. Often the relatives or a doctor notices
jaundice before the patient does. Jaundice can be classified into prehepatic, hepatic and posthepatic causes
(Table F).
If a patient presents with jaundice the following questions should be asked:
• What is the colour of the urine and stools? (Pale stools
and dark urine occur with intra- or extrahepatic biliary
obstruction.)
• Is there a history of abdominal pain? (Gallstones, for
example, can cause right upper quadrant pain and
jaundice.)
• Is there a history of fever, sweats or rigors? (Suggests
that the infection is either in the liver or biliary tree.)
• Does the patient itch? (Suggests obstruction to the bile
flow.)

Abdominal pain
Abdominal pain is a common presentation with many
causes. Careful history taking will steer investigation to
the appropriate organ system and will often lead to the
correct diagnosis. The following questions should be
considered:
• Site and radiation: Ask the patient to point to the area
affected by the pain and enquire about radiation of the
pain. Liver and biliary pain usually affects the epigastrium and right upper quadrant of the abdomen.
Hepatobiliary pain may radiate to the right shoulder tip
due to diaphragmatic irritation. Sometimes the pain is
only felt in the shoulder tip which can lead to difficulties
in diagnosis as patients may be thought to have chest or
rheumatological causes for the pain. Pancreatic pain is
felt in the epigastrium and often radiates to the back.
• Frequency and duration: It is important to determine
whether the pain is acute or chronic, when it began, how
long it lasts and how often it occurs.
• Character and pattern: Pain that comes and goes in
waves is related to peristaltic movements and is known
as colic. It typically suggests pain related to the bowel and
ureters. Whilst biliary pain is frequently called ‘biliary
colic’ this is often a misnomer as biliary pain is in fact
rarely colicky. Cystic duct obstruction tends to cause a
severe pain in the epigastric region that is constant and
can last for several hours. If cholecystitis develops, the
inflammation causes the pain to shift to the right upper
quadrant and to become more severe.
• Exacerbating and relieving factors: Biliary pain may be
precipitated by consumption of fatty meals since the
presence of fat in the gastrointestinal tract stimulates
gallbladder contraction via production of the hormone
cholecystokinin. Patients with pancreatic pain may
obtain some relief by sitting up and leaning forward.
• Associated symptoms: Nausea and vomiting are
common associated symptoms of biliary and pancreatic
pain. Itch suggests obstruction to biliary flow which may
reflect an intrahepatic or extrahepatic process.

this may suggest malignancy.)
• Has there been a recent outbreak? (Suggests viral hepa-

titis, e.g. infection with hepatitis A virus.)

Abdominal swelling

• Is there a risk factor for viral hepatitis? For example,

Persistent swelling of the abdomen often suggests fluid
accumulation within the peritoneal cavity (ascites).
Other causes of abdominal swelling must be considered
(for instance fat, pregnancy, flatus, faeces, organomegaly
and an abdominal tumour), but these can usually be differentiated from ascites from the history and subsequent
physical examination.

recent travel to an endemic country (e.g. in Africa or
Asia), sexual exposure, recreational drug use or receipt
of blood products.
• Has the patient taken any drugs?
• What is their alcohol consumption?
• Is there a family history of jaundice?

Part 1: Basics

If a patient is thought to have ascites, questions should
be asked to try to differentiate other processes from a
hepatic cause. For example, a diagnosis of heart failure
might be suggested by symptoms of breathlessness, chest
pain or a past history of ischaemic or valvular heart
disease. A history of renal disease could suggest nephrotic
syndrome and gynaecological or gastrointestinal symptoms may point to a malignant cause.

Gastrointestinal bleeding
Patients with liver disease may develop portal hypertension, which can lead to the development of anastomoses
between the portal and systemic venous systems and
the development of tortuous veins called varices.
Haemorrhage may occur from these vessels and can be
torrential and life threatening. Haematemesis (vomiting
blood) indicates that the site of the bleeding is proximal
to or at the duodenum. Whilst haematemesis in a patient
with liver disease may be caused by bleeding from
oesophago-gastric varices the other common causes of
acute gastrointestinal bleeding should always be considered (Box F). Melaena refers to the passage of black, tarry
stools and usually results from bleeding from the
upper digestive tract, although right-sided colonic or
small bowel lesions can occasionally be responsible.
Haematochezia is the passage of bright red blood per
rectum. It usually indicates a colonic cause such as diverticular disease, angiodysplasia or carcinoma. Patients
with liver disease may develop rectal bleeding secondary
to rectal varices and rarely patients can present with

Box F Causes of haematemesis and melaena
Common causes
• Peptic ulcer disease (duodenal ulcer, gastric ulcer,
erosions)
• Inflammation (oesophagitis, gastritis, duodenitis)
• Oesophageal and/or gastric varices
• Mallory–Weiss tear
Less common causes
• Dieulafoy lesion (ecstatic submucosal artery)
• Vascular abnormalities (angiodysplasia, arteriovenous
malformations, gastric antral vascular ectasia)
• Aortoenteric fistula
• Gastric carcinoma or other neoplasm
• Bleeding diathesis
• Alternative origin, e.g. nasopharyngeal bleeding or
haemoptysis

haematochezia caused by massive haemorrhage from
the upper gastrointestinal tract in the absence of
haematemesis.

Encephalopathy
Patients with liver disease may develop portosystemic
encephalopathy, a neuropsychiatric syndrome with disturbance of cognition and conscious level. This condition
occurs in both cirrhosis and acute liver failure. The
mechanism is not fully understood but impaired metabolic function of the liver in combination with blood
bypassing the liver through portosystemic collaterals,
allows ‘toxic’ metabolites direct access to the brain to
produce the encephalopathy. Patients will rarely recognise the presence of encephalopathy so friends and relatives should be interviewed and asked about alteration in
personality, mood and concentration. An early symptom
is reversal of the normal sleep pattern with daytime
somnolence but an inability to sleep at night.

Pruritus
Patients with liver disease, particularly cholestasis, may
describe intense itch which can be disabling. This is often
worse in the peripheries and at night.
Past medical history
A thorough review of past medical and surgical history is
a mandatory part of the history. Many medical and surgical conditions can predispose to liver and pancreaticobiliary disease. Examples include:
• A history of inflammatory bowel disease (either ulcerative colitis or Crohn’s disease) could suggest a diagnosis of
autoimmune hepatitis or primary sclerosing cholangitis.
• Surgical procedures could result in jaundice from the
anaesthesia (e.g. halothane), from hypoxic damage to
hepatocytes (secondary to hypotension) or from direct
damage to the bile duct during abdominal surgery.
• A history of autoimmune diseases such as thyroid
disease, rheumatoid arthritis or coeliac disease could
indicate autoimmune liver disease.
• A history of diabetes, hypercholesterolaemia or obesity
might suggest non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.
• A current or previous history of gallstones could indicate that abdominal pain is caused by gallstone pancreatitis or cholecystitis, or that jaundice is caused by stone
migration into the common bile duct resulting in biliary
obstruction.
• A history of diabetes, arthritis or cardiac dysrhythmia
or cardiomyopathy could indicate haemochromatosis.

Approach to the patient

KEY POI NT
• Non-prescription drugs are a frequent cause of liver
disease or jaundice and should be specifically enquired
about in anyone presenting with suspected liver
pathology

Family history
A number of liver-related conditions can have a familial
predisposition:
• A family history of jaundice may suggest haemolysis or
familial hyperbilirubinaemia.
• If family members are affected by anaemia or have
undergone a splenectomy, jaundice could be caused by
an inheritied haemolytic anaemia.
• A relative with hepatitis B infection should alert you to
the possibility of the patient being a chronic carrier of

that virus or a jaundiced patient having recently acquired
that virus.
• A family member with a history of iron overload requiring venesection, diabetes, heart or joint disease should
prompt consideration of a diagnosis of haemochromatosis.
Social history
The social history is particularly important when enquiring about potential liver disease since alcohol and viral
hepatitis are common causes. A detailed alcohol history
is mandatory and should ascertain the volume and type
of alcohol a patient is drinking to try to calculate the
amount of alcohol per week in units. Detailed enquiry is
necessary since patients often try to conceal the actual
amount from health care professionals. Furthermore,
patients often genuinely underestimate their alcohol consumption as the percentage and volume of alcohol served
has increased dramatically over the past two decades. For
example, 20 years ago a typical glass of wine was 125 ml
of 8% alcohol and contained 1 unit. Today a glass is more
likely to be 175 ml or even 250 ml of 13–15% alcohol.
Similarly beer used to be served as 3% alcohol but today
is more likely to be 5% or even 9%. This needs to be
borne in mind when estimating alcohol usage in units
(Table G). Safe recommendations for weekly alcohol
intake are less than 14 units for women and less than 21
units for men.
A full sexual history should be obtained, asking specifically about unprotected sex. As hepatitis B has an
incubation period of up to 6 months and can produce
chronic disease over many years it is important to
enquire about risk factors that may have occurred a long
time ago. A history of injections (e.g. intravenous drug
use or tattooing) is important as hepatitis B and C can
be transmitted in this way. It is not just sharing needles
that can put people at risk of acquiring blood-borne
viruses; sharing equipment used to prepare the drugs as
well as using the intranasal route of drug administration
are recognised risk factors for virus transmission. A

Medication history
A full enquiry into past and present medication is a mandatory part of any medical history. A large number of
drugs can interfere with bilirubin metabolism or affect
the liver directly, for example:
• Acute hepatitis can result from halothane, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or phenytoin.
• Cholestasis may occur from a sensitivity reaction to
many antibiotics and antipsychotic medications.
• Overdose of paracetamol (acetaminophen) can lead to
acute hepatocyte necrosis.
• Fatty liver can result from the use of tetracycline,
steroids or sodium valproate.
As well as asking about prescription medications it is also
important to specifically enquire about exposure to
drugs obtained from other sources. Jaundice, hepatitis,
cholestasis and even liver failure have been associated
with the use of illicit drugs (e.g. ecstasy), over the counter
agents, herbal remedies and substances obtained over the
internet (e.g. anabolic steroids).

PA R T 1 : B A S I C S

Examination
Preparation
You should begin by obtaining informed consent for the
examination from the patient. The patient should be
comfortable and positioned lying flat with their head
resting on a single pillow to relax the abdominal muscles
and facilitate abdominal palpation. Position a blanket to
maintain patient dignity but remember that a full examination of the abdomen will include examination of the
groins and genitalia in order not to miss important signs
that can indicate life-threatening disease.
Routine
When examining the abdomen it is important to remember that there are a number of organ systems contained
within it. The account below mainly outlines a schema
to focus on disorders of the hepatobiliary system but the
possibility of pathology in other systems (e.g. renal or
gastrointestinal) must always be considered.
The examination follows the standard routine of
inspection, palpation, percussion and auscultation. In
patients with liver disease a lot of information can be
gained from examining the limbs, face and chest and
these areas must not be forgotten in the eagerness to
examine the abdomen. Patients should be examined
methodically and at the end of the examination the findings should be presented in the same order:
• General inspection from the end of the bed.
• Hands and arms.
• Face.
• Neck and chest.
• Abdomen.
• Groins, perineum and legs.
General inspection
After introducing yourself and positioning the patient,
take a few steps back and look carefully at the patient and
around the bed. If available you should look at:
• Medication.
• Dietary restriction, e.g. low salt, NBM (nil by mouth).
• Other equipment (IV cannula, urinary catheter,
nasogastric tube).
• Temperature chart.
Next look at the patient but continue to resist the temptation to begin physical examination as much useful infor-

mation can be obtained from careful observation. Note
the general appearance of the patient:
• Are they resting comfortably or in obvious pain? Visceral
pain, such as seen in cholecystitis, might result in a restless
patient; peritoneal pain, such as that caused by a perforated viscus, usually produces a still patient but inspection
of the face will usually suggest that they are in pain.
• Are there features of weight loss present? Look for folds
of loose skin; observe whether clothes are too big.
Chronic liver disease tends to result in muscle wasting
which is often obvious in the face and upper limbs.
• Is the patient alert and cooperative or are they drowsy
or confused, which might suggest encephalopathy?
• Examine the colour of the patient’s skin. Is there
jaundice (yellow discolouration of the skin and sclera)
or pigmentation (haemochromatosis may produce a
‘bronze’ pigmentation due to haemosiderin stimulating
melanocytes to produce melanin)?
Hands and nails
Next take the patients hands and examine them carefully.
Time spent examining the hands is well spent as there are
many signs there that give clues to the presence of chronic
liver disease. None of these signs are specific for liver
disease, however, but the presence of one or more of
them are suggestive.

Finger clubbing
Clubbing is swelling of the soft tissue of the end of the
fingers or toes. Inspection from the side reveals a loss of
the angle between the nail bed and the finger and palpation may reveal an increased sponginess of the nail bed.
Eventually the distal phalanx becomes enlarged due to
the soft tissue swelling. The mechanism of clubbing is
uncertain but it may result from arteriovenous shunting
in the lungs producing arterial desaturation that results
in dilatation of the vessels of the fingertips or toes. Causes
of clubbing are given in Box G.

Approach to the patient

Dupuytren’s contracture
Dupuytren’s* contracture is a thickening of the palmar
fascia that causes permanent flexion of the fingers, most
often the ring finger. In the early phases it may not be
visible but can be felt as a thick ridge by the examiner’s
thumb palpating across the patient’s palm. It is often
bilateral and occasionally affects the soles of the feet. If it
is found in a patient with liver disease it strongly suggests
alcoholism. It can also be seen in manual workers and
may be idiopathic.

Palmar erythema
This is a reddening of the palms of the hands which is
especially prominent over the thenar and hypothenar
eminences. It is seen in chronic liver disease but also in
pregnancy, thyrotoxicosis, rheumatoid arthritis and
polycythaemia. The aetiology is uncertain but it may
reflect raised oestrogen levels that occur due to impaired
hepatic metabolism of sex hormones.

Hepatic flap
Before leaving the hands examine for the presence of a
hepatic flap or asterixis. Ask the patient to stretch out their
arms in front of them, extend the wrists and spread their
fingers apart. Irregular jerky movements at the wrists and
fingers indicate the asterixis of hepatic encephalopathy.
You should examine the patient in this position for 20–30
seconds to exclude confidentally a flap. Asterixis is usually
present bilaterally but the movements are not synchronous on each side. The mechanism is thought to reflect
metabolic interference with the flow of joint position sense
information to the brainstem. The flap is characteristic of
liver failure (acute or chronic) but can also be seen in
cardiac, respiratory and renal failure.

Arms
Examination of the patient with suspected liver disease
requires a thorough inspection of the arms as many clues
to the presence of liver disease may be found there.
Again, these are not specific but their presence can be a
strong indicator of liver pathology.

Spider naevi
Spider naevi are abnormal vessels usually found on the
skin in the area drained by the superior vena cava (i.e. the
arms, head and neck, and upper chest wall), the reason
for this distribution is not known. They consist of a
central arteriole with small vessels radiating out from it
resembling spiders’ legs. Pressure applied at the central
arteriole causes the entire lesion to blanch. They are
usually a few millimetres in size but occasionally can be
up to a centimetre. One or two may be seen in healthy
individuals but the presence of more than two is abnormal. They are sometimes seen in the latter stages of pregnancy or in women on the contraceptive pill raising the
suggestion that they are caused by oestrogen-mediated
dilatation on arterioles. They occasionally bleed but the
main concern they cause the patient is usually cosmetic.

Bruising
Examination of the arms of a patient with liver disease
frequently reveals bruising (ecchymoses) reflecting the
clotting abnormalities seen in liver disease. These may be
spontaneous or occur at the site of previous venepuncture or intravenous cannulation.

Petechiae
Pin-sized bruises may also be present and usually suggest
thrombocytopenia. This may be caused by platelet
sequestration and destruction in an enlarged spleen in
portal hypertension or bone marrow depression, which
is often a feature of chronic alcohol consumption.

Scratch marks
Patients with obstructive jaundice or cholestasis may be
troubled by severe itch (pruritus). This sensation is often
so intense that patients cannot resist the urge to itch and
can frequently scratch until they bleed leaving grazes and
marks on their skin.

Muscle wasting

evidence of loss of muscle bulk, which is often seen in

PA R T 1 : B A S I C S

Leuconychia
Leuconychia is the term given to the white discolouration
of the nails seen when they opacify. There is often a rim
of pink nail bed at the top of the nail. Leuconychia occurs
in hypoalbuminaemia, which may be secondary to
chronic liver disease, but is also seen in nephrotic syndrome and protein-losing enteropathies. The mechanism
is uncertain but may reflect compression of capillary flow
by extracellular fluid accumulation.

Jaundice
Examine the sclera carefully for jaundice as this is often
the only site that it can be detected clinically. Jaundice is
the only condition to cause yellow sclera, so if the skin is
yellow but not the sclerae then a diagnosis other than
jaundice should be sought (e.g. carotenaemia).

chest wall for spider naevi and for the presence of gynaecomastia in males. Enlargement of the breast tissue may
occur in cirrhosis, particularly alcoholic cirrhosis, and is
thought to reflect alteration in the oestrogen : testosterone ratio. Spironolactone, used to treat ascites in
cirrhosis and other conditions, is another cause of gynaecomastia, as are digoxin and cimetidine.
Abdomen
Now attention can be turned to the abdomen itself.

Kayser–Fleischer rings

Inspection

These are brownish green rings at the periphery of the
cornea, tending to affect the upper pole more than the
lower. They are due to deposits of excess copper in
Descemet’s membrane of the cornea. They are difficult
to see, especially in dark eyed individuals, and a slit-lamp
examination is often necessary to demonstrate them.
They are most commonly associated with Wilson’s
disease, a copper storage disease that causes cirrhosis and
neurological symptoms, but can also be seen in patients
with other cholestatic liver diseases. They are much loved
in picture books and exams but very rarely seen in clinical
practice.

Look for abdominal scars that may indicate previous
surgery or trauma. Note the presence of generalised
abdominal distension that could reflect ascites but will
need to be differentiated from fat, flatus, faeces, organomegaly and tumours. Localised swellings may indicate
a tumour mass, enlargement of one of the abdominal or
pelvic organs or a hernia.
In a patient with liver disease and portal hypertension,
prominent veins may be obvious on the abdominal wall.
Blood flows through portosystemic anastomoses into the
umbilical veins, which become engorged and distended.
The direction of flow is away from the umbilicus. This
sign is called a caput Medusae (head of Medusa), likening
the appearance to the mythical Medusa’s hair after it had
been turned into snakes. This needs to be differentiated
from venous engorgement secondary to inferior vena
cava obstruction when the direction of flow in the
engorged veins is upward towards the heart.

Xanthelasma
These yellowish plaques in the subcutaneous tissues in
the periorbital region are due to deposits of lipids. They
may indicate chronic hypercholesterolaemia. They can
be seen in patients with cholestasis and are particularly
common in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis.

Palpation
Parotid enlargement
Palpate the cheeks to examine for enlargement of the
parotid glands. This can be seen in alcoholism, which
causes fatty infiltration of the gland.

Hepatic fetor
Examine the mouth closely and note the presence of fetor
hepaticus, a rather sweet smell of the breath which is
present with severe hepatocellular dysfunction. It is
important to familiarise yourself with this smell since
detection of its presence in a patient with a coma of
otherwise unknown cause can be a very helpful clue to
the diagnosis of hepatic encephalopathy.
Neck and chest
Palpate the cervical lymph nodes, which can be involved
in advanced intra-abdominal malignancy. Examine the

This part of the examination often reveals the most information but in order to achieve this it is vital that the
patient is comfortable and the abdominal muscles are
relaxed. Ask the patient if any area is painful before you
start and examine this area last. Encourage the patient to
breathe gently throughout the examination and to
inform you if there is any tenderness.
The abdomen is divided into nine regions (Fig. O) and
each area should be palpated with the palmar surface of
the fingers. Begin with light pressure in each region,
noting the presence of any tenderness or lumps in each
region. Next perform firmer palpation to detect deeper
masses, taking care to avoid the tender areas until the end
of the examination. Note the presence of guarding, resistance to palpation that occurs due to contraction of the
abdominal muscles. This may be voluntary due to anxiety
or tenderness; involuntary guarding suggests peritonitis.

causes severe pain when the inflamed gallbladder presses
on the examiner’s hand (Murphy’s sign†).
The causes of an enlarged gallbladder are listed in Box
I. It is important to remember Courvoisier’s law,‡ which
states that an enlarged gallbladder in a patient with jaundice is unlikely to be due to gallstones as this situation
usually results in a chronically inflamed and fibrotic gallbladder incapable of enlargement. In a jaundiced patient,
a palpable gallbladder is more likely to be caused by
carcinoma of the head of the pancreas or lower biliary

Figure O Regions of the abdomen.

Box H Causes of hepatomegaly
Common causes
• Alcohol-related liver disease with fatty infiltration
• Right heart failure
• Metastases
• Hepatitis
• Fatty liver disease (e.g. secondary to diabetes and the
metabolic syndrome)

After superficial and deep palpation, the presence of
organomegaly should be specifically sought.
Hepatomegaly
An enlarged liver can often be palpated in the abdomen
below the right costal margin. The examining hand
should be held parallel to the costal margin with the
lateral margin of the forefinger towards the lowest rib.
Ask the patient to breathe in and out slowly and keeping
your hand still feel for the liver edge as it descends in
inspiration. It is important to begin examining in the
right iliac fossa so as not to miss the edge of a massively
enlarged liver. With each expiration, advance the hand 1
or 2 cm closer to the right costal margin. This examination should continue into the epigastrium as it is not
uncommon for the left lobe of the liver to be palpable to
the left of the midline in cirrhosis. If the liver edge is felt
examine its surface for tenderness and to determine
whether the liver is hard or soft, regular or irregular, and
whether it is pulsatile.
There are many causes of an enlarged liver (Box H). It
is important to remember that liver disease can also
result in a small liver that may not be palpable. For
example, in cirrhosis the fibrous scarring usually results
in a small shrunken liver, and in acute liver necrosis the
liver shrinks rapidly due to hepatocyte death.
The gallbladder
The gallbladder lies below the right costal margin where
this crosses the lateral border of the rectus muscles. It is
not usually palpable in health but if it is enlarged may be
felt as a focal rounded mass that moves down on inspiration. In cholecystitis, palpation at the costal margin

Other causes
• Malignancy (hepatocellular carcinoma, myeloproliferative
disorders, lymphoproliferative disorders)
• Infections (infectious mononucleosis, malaria, HIV,
hepatic abscesses, hydatid disease)
• Haemochromatosis
• Infiltration (e.g. amyloid)
• Biliary obstruction
Tender liver
• Hepatitis
• Rapid enlargement (right heart failure, Budd–Chiari

• Hepatic abscesses
Pulsatile liver
• Tricuspid regurgitation
• Vascular abnormalities
• Hepatocellular carcinoma

• Cirrhosis
• Metastatic disease

tree, resulting in biliary obstruction (Fig. P). The reverse
is not necessarily true however, an impalpable bladder in
a jaundiced patient may be due to gallstones but other
causes are also possible since it is common for a gallbladder to be dilated but impalpable.
Splenomegaly
An enlarged spleen cannot usually be detected clinically
until it is about twice its normal size. In the early stages
of enlargement, the spleen can be felt just below the left
costal margin towards its lateral margin. Further enlargement causes it to project inferiorly and medially.
Examination for an enlarged spleen should therefore
begin in the right iliac fossa so as not to miss a massively
enlarged spleen. Begin with the hand flat on the abdomen
with the index finger parallel to the left costal margin.
Keeping the hand still ask the patient to breathe in and
feel for the spleen tip descending in inspiration. In expiration advance the examining hand towards the left
costal margin. Palpation of a slightly enlarged spleen can
be helped by using a two-handed approach. As the right
hand approaches the costal margin use the left hand to
compress firmly posterolaterally over the lower rib cage
so as to remove the tension in the abdominal wall. If the
spleen is not palpable, the patient should be rolled onto
their right side towards the examiner and palpation using
the two-handed technique repeated. The causes of
splenomegaly are given in Box J and hepatosplenomegaly
in Box K.
Other organs
If you are asked to examine the abdomen then an attempt
to palpate the kidneys must be made. Even if hepatobiliary disease is suspected it is necessary to consider a renal
mass in the differential diagnosis of a right or left sub-

costal mass. Kidneys are best felt by bimanual palpation
with the patient lying flat on his or her back. For the right
kidney place the left hand underneath the patient’s back
with the palm in the right loin and the flexing fingers in
the renal angle. Press this hand forward whilst the right
hand presses down on the anterior abdomen above it.
With this technique, called balloting, the kidney may be
felt between the two hands. The opposite hands are used
for the left kidney. Box L outlines the features that differentiate a kidney from a spleen.
Other masses may be palpable on abdominal examination. If a mass is found then it should be fully characterised asking the following questions:

Approach to the patient

Massive splenomegaly
• Haematological (myelofibrosis, chronic myeloid
leukaemia, primary lymphoma of the spleen)
• Portal hypertension
• Infection (malaria, Kala azar)
Moderate splenomegaly
• The above causes
• Haematological malignancy (e.g. lymphoma, leukaemia)
• Thalassaemia
• Storage disorders (e.g. Gaucher’s disease)
Small splenomegaly
• The above causes
• Other myeloproliferative disorders (essential
thrombocytosis, polycythaemia rubra vera)
• Haemolytic anaemia
• Connective tissue disorders (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis,
systemic lupus erythematosus, polyarteritis nodosa)
• Infection: bacterial (e.g. infective endocarditis,
tuberculosis); viral (e.g. Epstein–Barr virus, viral
hepatitis); protozoa (e.g. malaria)
• Infiltration (e.g. amyloid, sarcoid)

Box K Causes of hepatosplenomegaly
• Chronic liver disease with portal hypertension
• Infection (e.g. acute viral hepatitis)
• Haematological disease (e.g. myeloproliferative disease,
lymphoma, leukaemia, pernicious anaemia, sickle cell
anaemia)
• Connective tissue disorder (e.g. systemic lupus
erythematosus)
• Infiltration (e.g. amyloid, sarcoid)
• Thyrotoxicosis
• Acromegaly

Box L Differences between a spleen and kidney
on clinical examination
• The upper border of the spleen cannot be palpated as it
lies above the costal margin. The upper border of the
kidney can be palpated
• The spleen has a notch which can be palpated. The
kidney does not have a notch
• The kidney is ballottable between the two examining
hands because of its retroperitoneal location. The spleen
is not usually ballottable
• The spleen moves inferomedially towards the right iliac
fossa on inspiration whereas the left kidney moves
inferiorally towards the left iliac fossa
• Percussion over the spleen is usually dull but percussion
over the kidney is resonant as it lies underneath
gas-filled bowel

Percussion
Abdominal percussion is performed to define the size
and nature of organs and masses, to find out whether
distension is due to gas, free fluid (ascites), encased fluid
(e.g. a cyst) or a solid mass and to elicit tenderness in a
patient with peritonitis.
Liver
The liver borders should be percussed to determine the
total liver span. Percuss down the chest along the midclavicular line noting where the percussion note changes
from resonant to dull, normally level with the sixth rib.
The measurement from this point to the palpable liver
edge gives the liver span, usually less than 12 cm in health.
If the liver edge is palpable, assessing the liver span is
important to determine whether the liver is enlarged or
merely displaced downwards, for example by overinflated emphysematous lungs. With experience it is also
possible to define a small, shrunken cirrhotic liver by
percussion.

• What is the site of the mass? State the region of the

abdomen involved using Fig. O.
Is it possible to palpate above it?
What is its size and shape?
Is the surface smooth or irregular?
Is the edge regular or irregular?
What is the consistency (e.g. hard or soft)?
Is the mass mobile? Does it move on inspiration?
Is it pulsatile?
Is there any tenderness?

Spleen
Percussion is not a particularly helpful method of detecting an enlarged spleen but can sometimes be helpful if it
is doubtful whether the tip can be felt.
Ascites
Accumulation of fluid within the peritoneum may be
suspected by inspection and palpation but must be confirmed by percussion. Percussion over the abdomen

Part 1: Basics

normally produces a resonant note due to air within the
gastrointestinal tract. If peritoneal fluid (ascites) is
present the percussion note becomes dull. The liquid
gravitates to the dependent part of the abdomen, thus in
the supine patient there is dullness in the flanks and this
dullness shifts when the patient is rotated onto their side.
This phenomenon is referred to as shifting dullness.
When examining for ascites place the left hand on the
abdomen over the midline with the fingers of the left
hand pointing to the feet. Strike the middle phalanyx of
the left middle finger with the tip of the right middle
finger. Percuss from the resonant centre of the abdomen
into the left flank until the percussion note becomes dull.
Keep the left hand in place and ask the patient to roll
onto their right side. Pause for a few seconds to allow the
fluid to move then repeat percussion. If the percussion
note has become resonant and percussion back towards
the umbilicus re-establishes a dull note, ascites is suggested. Occasionally a large ovarian cyst or fluid within
dilated bowel in small intestinal obstruction can cause
confusion.
In massive ascites, a fluid thrill may be detectable
although this is not examined for routinely. Ask an assistant to place a hand firmly on the centre of the abdomen.
Flick the side of the abdominal wall and feel for a pulsation (thrill) with the other hand placed on the other side
of the abdomen. An additional useful technique when
there is significant ascites is dipping over the upper
abdomen to determine if the liver or spleen is enlarged.
Place the hand flat on the abdomen and flex the fingers
at the metacarpophalangeal joints rapidly to displace
underlying fluid. The rapid displacement of fluid allows
the fingers to reach an organ or mass covered in ascites.
Causes of ascites are given in Box M.

Auscultation
Many abdominal sounds have been described in patients
with liver disease but in general it is rare for auscultation
to be very contributory to the examination of the hepatobiliary system. It must be performed as part of the
complete abdominal examination, however, and is essential so as not to miss vital signs that can suggest bowel
obstruction or perforation.
Using the diaphragm of the stethoscope, listen over the
abdomen for the presence and character of bowel sounds,
friction rubs, arterial bruits and venous hums. If the liver
is enlarged it is important to listen over its surface. A
friction rub is a grating sound heard when the patient
breathes; it is produced by inflammation in the liver

Box M Causes of ascites
• Cirrhosis
• Congestive cardiac failure
• Intra-abdominal malignancy (e.g. gastrointestinal,
gynaecological)
• Pancreatitis
• Infection (e.g. pyogenic, tuberculosis)
• Budd–Chiari syndrome
• Meig’s syndrome*
• Nephrotic syndrome
• Protein-losing enteropathy
• Hypothyroidism

1942–55) described a syndrome of fibroma of the ovary

capsule (e.g. by a liver tumour, a hepatic infarct, a recent
liver biopsy or the very rare Fitz-Hugh–Curtis syndrome†
when a perihepatitis complicates pelvic inflammatory
disease). Arterial systolic bruits are occasionally heard
over the liver in hepatocellular carcinoma, acute alcoholic hepatitis or with an arteriovenous malformation.
More commonly, arterial bruits are due to stenoses in the
aorta, mesenteric or renal arteries. Rarely, a venous hum
can be heard between the xiphisternum and umbilicus
due to turbulence in the collateral circulation in portal
hypertension.
Further examination
To complete the examination of the abdominal system it
is essential to examine the hernia orifices, the external
genitalia and perform a rectal examination (Box N).
Examine the legs for pitting oedema.
On finishing your examination thank the patient, help
them back into their clothing and ensure that they are
left in a comfortable position. A summary of the clinical
examination of a patient with suspected liver disease is
given in Box O.

recorded the information needs to be analysed in order to:

Approach to the patient

• Pale stools: obstructive jaundice/cholestasis
• Melaena: upper gastrointestinal bleeding (may identify
the cause of encephalopathy in someone presenting in a
coma)
• Constipation: may exacerbate encephalopathy
• Steatorrhoea: malabsorption which may be a feature of
cholestasis

• Consider the differential diagnosis. In straightforward

cases a single provisional diagnosis may be evident. In
others a number of possible diagnoses may need to be
considered.
• Create a problem list. In some complicated cases it
may be necessary to create a problem list considering new
complaints, co-morbidities and social circumstances.
• Create a strategy for investigation.
• Develop a treatment plan.
• Arrange follow-up.
A plan for further review of the patient needs to be
documented. If seen in the GP surgery or outpatient
clinic this may be to be reviewed again when the results
of investigations are available or to contact the patient to
let them know the investigation results. A patient attending the emergency department may need to be admitted
or discharged with investigations organised as an
outpatient.

Investigations performed in hepatology
Blood tests
Blood investigations are an important aspect in managing patients with liver disease and are able to give insight
into hepatic damage, hepatic function, aetiology of
disease and prognosis.

Liver function tests
The term ‘liver function tests’ (LFTs) is a misnomer as
these tests are not optimal measures of hepatic function
(albumin and coagulation are more useful ‘functional’
tests). Nonetheless LFTS can alert clinicians to the possibility of underlying hepatic injury. Moreover, the
pattern of abnormality in LFTS is often more helpful in
clinical practice than individual test results. The following are the most commonly used LFTs:

• Alanine aminotransferase (ALT): This is an enzyme

that catalyses the conversion of alanine to pyruvate. It is
present is high concentrations within hepatocytes so
elevated levels suggest hepatocyte damage/necrosis.
• Aspartate aminotransferase (AST): AST is located in
the mitochondrial membrane in hepatocytes but is also
contained in erythrocytes, myocardium and skeletal
muscle. In the context of liver disease it reflects hepatocellular necrosis. Generally, hepatitis results in a similar
pattern of elevation in both AST and ALT. An elevated
AST : ALT ratio, however, can indicate alcoholic liver
disease or signify liver fibrosis in the context of nonalcoholic liver disease.
• Alkaline phosphatase (ALP): A number of isoenzymes
of ALP exist including bone, intestine, placenta and liver.
An elevation in the liver ALP isoform can be indicative
of biliary disease or cholestasis (intrahepatic or
extrahepatic).
• Gamma glutamyl transferase (γ-GT): This can be
raised in a number of liver conditions including alcoholic
liver disease, cholestasis and liver fibrosis. An elevated
γ-GT can be helpful in the context of a raised ALP in
suggesting a hepatic origin for the ALP.
• Bilirubin: This is elevated in haemolysis, cholestasis or
impaired hepatic function. Distinguishing unconjugated
(indirect) bilirubin from conjugated (direct) bilirubin
can be useful in some cases.

Synthetic function
Prolongation of the prothombin time (PT) can imply
significant liver disease as the liver is incapable of synthesising normal coagulation factors. It can also occur in the
presence of cholestasis or malnutrition due to interruption of gastrointestinal vitamin K absorption (a fatsoluble vitamin dependent on bile salts for absorption).
Administration of intravenous vitamin K will correct for
any reduced absorption (due to biliary disease or malnutrition) but will not correct abnormalities related to
hepatic synthesis.
Reduced serum albumin is a feature of chronic liver
disease and a falling albumin has prognostic significance.
It should be noted that any major insult causing a stress
response (e.g. surgery, sepsis, injury, etc.) will lead to an
acute reduction in albumin production.

Renal function and electrolytes
Low urea and creatinine concentrations in liver disease
reflect the reduced muscle mass that accompanies cirrhosis. Therefore absolute values of creatinine may falsely

reassure and glomerular filtration rates or the relative
change in creatinine may be a better indicator of renal
function. It is particularly important to monitor renal
function in decompensated cirrhosis as early diagnosis of
renal dysfunction, with instigation of treatment, may
reverse the condition.
In advanced cirrhosis, total body overload of salt and
water occurs; body water retention exceeds sodium
retention resulting in hyponatraemia. Secondary hyperaldosteronism is common in cirrhosis and results in
hypokalaemia. Other electrolyte disturbances such as
hypophosphataemia, hypomagnesaemia and reduced
serum selenium are not uncommon in patients with
advanced liver disease. These may require correction by
intravenous therapy to prevent refeeding syndrome
when liver disease patients are hospitalised.

alcohol) can also cause bone marrow suppression. The
production of the hormone thrombopoietin, involved in
the synthesis of platelets, is reduced in advanced liver
disease and this will also contribute to the thrombocytopenia. Haemolysis is associated with certain aetiologies
of liver disease (e.g. autoimmune hepatitis, Zieve’s syndrome* and Wilson’s disease).
Tests for the aetiology of liver disease
Liver disease is often asymptomatic and therefore blood
tests are an important diagnostic tool in determining the
aetiology of the disease. The chronic liver disease screen
is a useful set of investigations in patients presenting with
chronically deranged liver function tests (Table H).

Full blood count

Tumour markers
The common tumour markers used in liver disease are
α-fetoprotein (AFP) and CA19-9:

A pancytopenia (low white blood cell count, haemoglobin and platelet count) in cirrhosis occurs as a result
of portal hypertension causing pooling of blood in the
splanchnic circulation. Certain aetiological agents (e.g.

therefore can be raised in chronic liver disease and cirrhosis per se. A single AFP reading has limitations but a
persistently elevated AFP on follow-up is a strong indicator of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
• CA19-9 is a commonly used tumour marker for
cholangiocarcinoma. The sensitivity and specificity of the
test is not optimal; for example, any cause of cholestasis
or cholangitis may elevate the CA19-9. Therefore it can
be rarely used to diagnose cholangiocarcinoma without
support from radiological imaging or biopsy.
• CA125 can be elevated in any cause of ascites; this
needs to be considered in the context of investigating
ovarian disease and coexisting liver disease.

obstructive cause such as gallstones in the common bile
duct, a pancreatic carcinoma or cholangiocarcinoma.
• Gallstones can easily be seen in the gallbladder using
US. Stones in the common bile duct are more difficult to
visualise by US and often require more specialist investigations such as magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP), computed tomography (CT)
and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography
(ERCP).
• The cirrhotic liver may be enlarged (e.g. in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis), normal or reduced in size. The
echopattern of the liver is frequently described as coarse
(increased irregular echogenicity) in cirrhosis and the
margin of the liver may be irregular.
• The presence of ascites and splenomegaly on US examination in patients with liver disease is strongly suggestive of cirrhosis (the main differential is portal vein
thrombosis).
• Doppler ultrasound provides a technique to measure
blood flow in the portal vein, hepatic artery and hepatic
veins. It measures the frequency differences between the
US signal emitted from the transducer and returned from
the vessel; this generates direction and velocity of blood
flow. The major vascular changes seen in cirrhosis reflect
underlying portal hypertension. They include the reversal
of portal vein blood from hepatopetal to hepatofugal,
flattening of the Doppler waveform in hepatic veins, and
enlargement of the portal vein to greater than 15 mm.

Imaging
Hepatobiliary radiology is complex and close liaison with
a hepatobiliary radiologist to decide on appropriate
investigation and to aid interpretation in the correct
clinical context is an important interface in clinical
hepatology.

Ultrasound
Ultrasound (US) is a relatively inexpensive, non-invasive
method of assessing the biliary system, the size and echotexture of the liver, vascular patency and in detecting
space-occupying lesions within the liver (Fig. Q). It is a
useful first-line imaging investigation for the jaundiced
patient.

on the background of cirrhosis. Isolated nodules, larger
than 2 cm, are detected with a good sensitivity but a lower
specificity. The performance of US in the presence of
diffuse malignancy is poor. Confirmation of US findings
of HCC are required by cross-sectional imaging (CT or
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)).

Computed tomography
• CT provides cross-sectional anatomy of the liver. With

the advent of multislice CT scanning detailed information about space-occupying lesions can be gleaned with
very short acquisition times.
• Helical CT can also utilise vascular anomalies of lesions
by obtaining images in the arterial, portal venous phase
and delayed phase (triple phase). For example HCC will
typically have a brisk enhancement during the arterial
phase (Fig. R) but appears hypodense during the delayed
phase (rapid washout).
• Direct catheterisation of the superior mesenteric artery
and hepatic artery can also be used in combination with
CT to improve diagnostic accuracy. Therefore, CT in
isolation or combination with arteriography is able to
provide a vascular ‘road map’ highlighting the blood
supply of lesions or vascular anomalies.
• CT is not the ideal modality to assess liver parenchyma.
However, in certain aetiologies changes in the density of
liver parenchyma can be pronounced; e.g. increased

density in haemochromatosis and decreased density in
fatty infiltration.

Magnetic resonance imaging
More detailed images of liver parenchyma can be
obtained by MRI compared to CT; furthermore patients
are not subjected to ionising radiation. The major disadvantage is the availability of equipment and time required
to acquire the images.
• MRI can be useful in diagnosing benign conditions
such as haemangiomas, focal nodular hyperplasia and
adenomas. The use of contrast agents such as lipiodol,
gadolinium and superparamagnetic contrast agents (e.g.
resovist) are often utilised to separate benign lesions
from HCC.
• MRI has been used to assess hepatic iron
concentration.
• Magnetic resonance (MR) angiography (useful in
assessing vasculature) and MR spectroscopy (with a role
in assessing hepatic steatosis) are emerging areas of
MRI.

MRCP and ERCP
• MRCP is a non-invasive method of assessing the pan-

creatic and biliary tree. With improving hardware and
technical expertise it represents the preferred modality
for the diagnosis of biliary gallstones (Fig. S(a)) in comparison to more invasive ERCP. In addition, it is useful

primary sclerosing cholangitis, pancreatic divisum and
cholangicarcinoma.
• ERCP is largely a therapeutic modality in modern-day
practice. The specially designed endoscope has a side
viewer allowing visualisation and cannulation of the
biliary and pancreatic tree (Fig. S(b)). For gallstone
disease, it allows the removal of gallstones and dissection
of the ampulla of Vater (sphincterotomy). ERCP is also
used to place stents across strictures of the pancreatic and
biliary duct. The complications of ERCP include bleeding, pancreatitis and perforation of the bowel so considered thought should be given before undertaking the
procedure.

Miscellaneous procedures
• Arteriography can be useful for detailed characterisa-

tion of hepatic vasculature (Fig. T). In addition it may
aid the diagnosis of HCC, find the source of haemorrhage within the liver and be part of therapy in HCC
(transarterial chemoembolisation is when chemotherapy agents are delivered locally to the HCC and the
feeding blood vessel to the tumour is simultaneously
embolised).
• Percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (PTC) is
utilised by interventional radiologists to access the

biliary tree (Fig. U). It is often required in high strictures
(e.g. hilar strictures) when access is not possible by
ERCP.
• Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) has become an important tool in hepatobiliary disease. In addition to staging
disease (e.g. pancreatic carcinoma), it is used to obtain
tissue for histological confirmation. In the appropriate
hands it is superior to MRCP for diagnosing cholelithiasis in the common bile duct and has an emerging role
in the drainage of pancreatic pseudocysts, coeliac nerve
plexus blocks in chronic pancreatitis and assessing submucosal gastric varices.

Histology and liver biopsy
Histological analysis is an important diagnostic tool for
assessing liver disease. The method for obtaining a liver
biopsy can vary from the transabdominal approach, transjugular approach, laparoscopic approach and open
approach at operation or postmortem. The choice of
route will depend on factors such as body habitus, clotting abnormalities, presence of ascites, available expertise
and quantity of specimen required. Contraindications
for the transabdominal approach are shown in Box P.
The biopsy delineates aetiology (e.g. viral hepatitis, alcoholic liver disease, metabolic liver disease, etc.), severity

of disease (early fibrosis or cirrhosis) and specific pathological entities (e.g. steatosis or necroinflammation in
non-alcoholic fatty liver disease).
Liver biopsy does have its limitations and some have
questioned whether it truly represents a ‘gold standard’
reference test. In large studies of patients undergoing

biopsy, pain has been reported in 20% and severe complications reported in 0.57%. Sampling error exists,
which is unsurprising considering the average biopsy
specimen represents 1/50 000th of the organ. Interpretation of the biopsy is open both to intra- and interobserver error.

Non-invasive markers of liver fibrosis
The liver biopsy, when performed and analysed by specialists, represents a very useful tool to define aetiology
and delineate specific pathology including steatosis,
necroinflammation and fibrosis. However, the rising
prevalence of liver disease in association with patient
choice, ethical implications of an invasive diagnostic test
and economic considerations have led to the development of non-invasive tests of liver fibrosis. Hitherto,
these have been utilised in clinical research but they are
starting to emerge in clinical practice. The tests can be
divided into three broad areas:

1 Serum panel marker tests using routine clinical parameters (e.g. platelet count, AST : ALT ratio and albumin)
or markers of fibrogenesis (e.g. hyaluronic acid, metalloproteases, serum type III procollagen peptide (PIII
NP), etc.) or a combination.
2 Imaging modalities such as fibroscan (which measures
the speed of a propagated wave across the liver using a
specially adapted ultrasound device) and variants of MRI
(e.g. MR spectroscopy and MR elastography).
3 High through put ‘omics’ technologies (e.g.
proteomics).

A 19-year-old man presenting with
jaundice

Mr John Farrelly is a 19-year-old student who presents with
a short history of abdominal discomfort and jaundice. He
has associated symptoms of fatigue, decreased appetite and
myalgia. You have been asked to review him in the jaundice
clinic.

What is the differential diagnosis
for his jaundice?
Jaundice can be classified into:
1 Prehepatic jaundice (e.g. haemolysis).
2 Hepatocellular jaundice (e.g. hepatitis).
3 Posthepatic jaundice (e.g. obstruction of the biliary
tree).

What additional questions would be
helpful in your routine history?
• How long has he had these symptoms? An assessment
of the chronology of his symptoms should be made to try
to determine whether this is an acute or chronic process.
In doing so it is important to recognise that liver disease
can frequently be asymptomatic for months or years
prior to presentation; however, a history of vague symptoms such as tiredness or anorexia might suggest a
chronic process.
• Has he had a similar episode before? A history of
becoming jaundiced with previous viral illnesses might
suggest a diagnosis of Gilbert’s syndrome. Alternatively,
it might represent a rarer cause of jaundice such as
haemolytic anaemia or benign, recurrent intrahepatic
cholestasis (BRIC), an autosomally recessive disorder
characterised by intermittent attacks of cholestasis that
spontaneously resolve.
• What are the colour of his stools and urine? Dark urine
and pale stools suggests an obstructive or cholestatic

and Indra Neil Guha. Published 2011 by Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

picture. The presence of these changes does not differentiate between intrahepatic and extrahepatic biliary
obstruction, however, but they do differentiate from a
prehepatic cause of jaundice.
• What is the nature of his pain? Pain of biliary origin
(severe, right upper quadrant pain in a band) may raise
the suspicion of an obstructive picture secondary to gallstones. Pain of acute hepatitis is usually not severe but
more of a dull ache over the liver.
• Is there a history of travel? Acute viral hepatitis may
present with jaundice. Hepatitis A and E are transmitted
by the faecal–oral route and are frequently acquired in
countries where sanitation is poor (e.g. in Asia and
Africa). Hepatitis B is transmitted parenterally and has a
high prevalence in areas such as Asia and Africa. Sexual
contact or surgery or receipt of blood products in such a
country should be enquired about.
• Is there any family history? There is a genetic component to some of the prehepatic causes of jaundice. For
example, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD)
deficiency is an X-linked recessive condition and haemolysis can be precipitated by antimalarial medication.
• Has he been in contact with anyone with a similar
illness? Infection with hepatitis A and occasionally hepatitis E can result in outbreaks in communities.
• Does he have any risk factors for transmissible hepatitis? A sexual history should be obtained as well as a
history of intravenous drug use. Enquiries should be
made about receipt of blood products, surgery in underdeveloped countries, tattoos and body piercing. As some
hepatitis viruses can have incubation periods of as long
as 6 months it is important to extend the history taking
over that period.
• What is his alcohol intake? Alcohol is a common cause
of jaundice and should always be specifically enquired
about.
• Has he taken any medication? Prescribed and recreational drugs should be asked about. Antibiotics and
herbal remedies are often taken and forgotten about so

specifically ask about these. Drugs can cause a hepatocellular or cholestatic hepatitis.
Mr Farrelly describes no change in colour of his stools or
urine. His abdominal discomfort is mild and left sided but is
constant. There has been no recent travel abroad, he denies
any recreational drugs or recent medications and he is
teetotal. He is unaware of any family history of jaundice.

PA R T 2 : C A S E S

What clinical signs would you look for?
In addition to excluding signs of chronic liver disease the
following may be useful to look for in this case:
• Confirm the presence of jaundice by examining the
sclera.
• Hepatosplenomegaly and lymphadenopathy may
imply an underlying haematological disorder.
• Tenderness in the right upper quadrant may suggest
gallstones.
• Kayser–Fleischer rings in the eyes are associated with
Wilson’s disease.
On examination Mr Farrelly is jaundiced. He has mild
splenomegaly and axillary lymphadenopathy. No signs of
chronic liver disease are seen. Blood tests reveal the
following:
Bilirubin

48 µmol/L

ALT

28 iU/L

ALP

95 iU/L

Albumin

36 g/L

Hb

13.6 g/dL

WBC
Plt

6.7 × 109/L
520 × 109/L

What additional investigations
would be helpful?
The liver function tests are all normal except for an isolated hyperbilirubinaemia. This is suggestive of a prehepatic jaundice. The major differential diagnosis is an
overproduction of bilirubin (e.g. haemolysis) or disturbance of bilirubin conjugation. The following investigations would be helpful:
• Conjugated/unconjugated bilirubin: An elevated unconjugated bilirubin (indirect) would confirm a prehepatic
cause of jaundice. In the absence of haemolysis this
would suggest an inherited disorder of conjugation such
as Gilbert’s syndrome or Crigler–Najjar syndrome.
• Haemolysis screen: This includes a blood film for fragmented red blood cells; an absolute reticulocyte count;

plasma levels of haptoglobin; and haemosiderin detection in the urine.
• Viral serology: The absence of a transaminitis suggests
that this is not a viral hepatitis. The splenomegaly and
lymphadenopathy imply this, however, could be due to
a systemic viral infection and serology for Epstein–
Barr virus (EBV) and cytomegalovirus (CMV) would be
useful.
Further investigations show an indirect bilirubin of 35 µmol/L
and a direct bilirubin of 13 µmol/L. The haemolysis screen is
negative. Serology shows the presence of high EBV IgM
titres suggestive of recent infection. The likely diagnosis is
therefore that of Gilbert’s syndrome (Box 1.1) with jaundice
precipitated by an intercurrent illness (EBV infection).

Box 1.1 Gilbert’s syndrome
• Prevalence is approximately 5% in Western society
• It results from a genetic defect in UGT1A1 on
chromosome 2 (autosomal recessive) and results in
decreased hepatic glucuronidation (by approximately
30%)
• Fasting will increase bilirubin levels and this can be a
useful diagnostic test
• Bilirubin levels are usually less than 100 µmol/L
• Liver biopsy is not necessary and if performed is normal
• The condition is entirely benign and associated with a
normal lifespan
• It is a related condition of the Crigler–Najjar syndrome.
Type 1 results in a complete absence of conjugating
enzyme with severe hyperbilirubinaemia, usually
presenting in early life. In type 2, the conjugating
enzyme is reduced to less than 10%. The bilirubinaemia
in type 2 is usually higher than Gilbert’s syndrome but
molecular analysis can distinguish these two conditions

What treatment and further follow-up
would you recommend?
The jaundice will improve and no specific treatment is
required. Reassurance should be given to the patient. It
is also important to warn them that future episodes may
occur and be precipitated by illness or fasting. Regular
follow-up in a liver clinic is not required. It would be
extremely rare for EBV to produce a chronic hepatitis
although not uncommon for it to be associated with a
prolonged period of fatigue.

Case 1 41

CASE RE V IEW
A young man presented with jaundice and isolated
elevation in bilirubin. The absence of derangement in
other liver function tests and raised indirect bilirubin levels
was suggestive of a disorder in conjugation or haemolysis.

The negative haemolysis screen was helpful in establishing
the diagnosis of Gilbert’s syndrome precipitated by an
intercurrent illness (acute EBV infection).

KE Y P O I NTS
• The management of Gilbert’s syndrome is conservative
• The long-term prognosis of Gilbert’s syndrome is
excellent; patients have a normal lifespan and require no
active intervention

PA R T 2 : C A S E S

• An isolated hyperbilirubinaemia in the absence of a
transaminitis suggests a prehepatic cause for the jaundice
• A haemolysis screen and separation of bilirubin into
‘direct’ and ‘indirect’ components are important tests for
prehepatic jaundice

malaise, anorexia and fever. He is normally fit and well but
began to feel ill 2 weeks after returning from a holiday to
rural India. During the consultation the GP notices that he is

jaundiced.

What questions would you ask him?
How long has he had these symptoms?
Has he had a similar illness before?
Is there a history of pain?
Have there been any changes to the colour of the urine
or stool?
• Has there been any weight loss?
• Is there a family history of liver disease or similar
illnesses?
• Has he been in contact with anyone with a similar
illness?
• Does he have any risk factors for transmissible
hepatitis?
• What is his country of origin?
• What is his past medical history?
• Has he taken any medication or other substance?
A more detailed account of the history required in a
patient presenting with jaundice is given in Case 1.

•
•

What signs would you look for on
examination?
The history is suggestive of an episode of viral hepatitis
and findings such as lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly are to be expected. It is also important to
exclude more serious presentations that might require
urgent attention in hospital. Your examination therefore
needs to address two important questions:

Hepatology: Clinical Cases Uncovered, 1st edition. © Kathryn Nash
and Indra Neil Guha. Published 2011 by Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

42

1 Are there signs of liver failure? In acute liver injury the
most important fact to ascertain is whether the liver is
functioning. It is very rare for an acute liver injury to
result in liver failure, but if it does occur it does so very
quickly and there is only a very narrow window to intervene to save the patient’s life. Signs of encephalopathy
should be sought for such as impaired concentration or
confusion, and the presence of a hepatic asterixis should
be looked for.
2 Are there signs of chronic liver disease? Signs of
chronic liver disease such as palmar erythema, spider
naevi and splenomegaly should be sought as their presence is more suggestive of a longstanding process. Their
absence, however, does not exclude a chronic liver
disease.

On examination Mr Dixon does not have any signs of
chronic liver disease, there is no hepatic fetor or asterixis
and his cognition appears normal. In his abdomen his liver is
palpable 2 cm below the costal margin but there is no
splenomegaly or ascites. His blood test results come back
later that day:
Bilirubin
ALT
ALP
Albumin
CRP

87 μmol/L
1842 iU/L
176 iU/L
38 g/L
5 mg/L

What does this pattern of blood
tests suggest?
The striking elevation in ALT suggests inflammation of
the parenchyma of the liver, which is known as hepatitis.
ALT is present intracellularly in hepatocytes and is
released into the blood in response to hepatocyte injury
and necrosis. The C-reactive protein (CRP) is normal
making a bacterial infection unlikely.

Case 2 43

• Acute viral hepatitis: In a young, previously well

person, acute viral hepatitis is the most likely diagnosis.
This may be caused by a directly hepatotrophic virus or
by another virus that causes hepatitis as part of a multisystem illness (e.g. CMV, EBV).
• Acute autoimmune hepatitis: This is a rare cause of
jaundice but it is important as it needs urgent referral to
hospital for diagnosis and treatment to limit the degree
of liver damage.
• Drug-related liver injury: A variety of drugs may cause
liver injury. Diagnosis is important to prevent ongoing
damage and to ensure that the drug is avoided in the
future.
• Metabolic cause: Rare metabolic disorders that can
present acutely should always be considered, particularly
in young people (e.g. Wilson’s disease).
• Others: A variety of other processes can cause acute
liver injury and should be considered, e.g. vascular disorders (ischaemic hepatitis, venous thrombosis), lymphoma and pregnancy. Other rare causes include
mushroom poisoning and injury related to toxins or
chemicals. In a significant number of cases no cause
is identified and the illness is called seronegative
hepatitis.

What other important blood test
should be done?
The single most important test is one to assess the synthetic function of the liver. This is best achieved by
testing blood coagulation with either a prothrombin time
(PT) or international normalised ratio (INR) since most
of the factors required for blood clotting are synthesised
within the liver. Impairment of this process is a marker
of severe liver injury and any patient with a suspected
acute liver injury and impaired coagulation must be
immediately referred to hospital.
The traditional ‘liver function tests’ (bilirubin,
transaminases and alkaline phosphatase) do not actually
test liver function and are unhelpful when determining
if there is liver failure requiring urgent referral to hospital. Elevation in these blood tests is variable and of no
prognostic value. For example, in acute viral hepatitis,
hepatic necrosis commonly results in an ALT of several
thousand but a normal INR. This indicates that there is
liver cell damage but that adequate synthetic function
remains.

KEY POINT
• In an acute liver injury the most important test is to
make an assessment of blood clotting with either
prothrombin time or INR. The result must be obtained
that day and if there is impairment of coagulation the
patient must be referred to hospital immediately

What further tests would you organise?
• Acute viral hepatitis screen: In acute illness it is important to look for evidence of recent viral infection and to
differentiate this from past exposure, vaccination or
chronic infection. IgM antibodies are the first antibodies
produced in response to infection and, therefore, the
presence of IgM antibodies to viruses known to cause
acute hepatitis should be sought (Table 2.1).
• Autoimmune screen: An immunological assessment is
required including immunoglobulins, antinuclear antibody (ANA) and liver-specific antibodies (anti-smooth
muscle antibody, anti-liver/kidney microsomal antibody,
antimitochondrial antibody).
• Metabolic screen: Blood should be sent to test for caeruloplasmin and copper to investigate the possibility of
Wilson’s disease.
• Urea and electrolytes: Severe liver injury can occasionally cause renal failure. Electrolyte disturbance is common
especially if there is nausea and anorexia leading to poor

• Full blood count: An eosinophilia may suggest a druginduced liver injury.
• Liver imaging: Ultrasound is the most helpful screening test. It is necessary to exclude biliary obstruction, to

hepatic vessels.

How do you interpret the viral

• He has a positive IgM antibody against hepatitis E

virus and has not yet produced an IgG antibody, indicating recent infection.
• The absence of hepatitis A IgM antibody excludes
acute hepatitis A infection. He has a positive IgG antibody against this virus, which could have occurred due
to previous infection or vaccination. Prior to travelling

to an endemic area such as India, vaccination is strongly
recommended.
• He has evidence of previous exposure to EBV (glandular fever) but not acute infection.
• There is no evidence of past or current infection with
hepatitis B, hepatitis C, CMV or HSV.

a coagulopathy and the liver function tests are starting to
improve. Provided that these tests can be taken and
reviewed promptly he can be managed in the
community.

How should the patient be managed?

Cases of viral hepatitis should be notified to the Health
Protection Agency who will investigate the potential
source. This is an important public health measure to try
to limit future outbreaks.

What else must you do?

Mr Dixon is seen daily by his GP and his bloods improve. Six
weeks later he feels fully recovered and his liver function
tests have returned to normal. Convalescent serology reveals
a positive IgG antibody against hepatitis E and the IgM
antibody is no longer detectable.

CASE REV IE W
This man is normally fit and healthy but presented with an
acute illness characterised by non-specific symptoms of
nausea and anorexia. He was jaundiced and blood tests
revealed a significantly elevated ALT consistent with
hepatic inflammation and necrosis. On examination there
were no signs of encephalopathy or chronic liver disease.
His INR was normal suggesting that the liver was still

capable of synthetic function. Further blood tests revealed
that he had acute infection with hepatitis E virus. His jaundice settled and he made a full recovery. Convalescent
serology was in keeping with a recent acute hepatitis E
infection as evidenced by the loss of IgM antibody and the
development of IgG antibody.

KEY POI NTS
• Acute viral hepatitis is a common cause of liver injury. It is
usually self-limiting and patients make a full recovery
• It is rare for patients with acute viral hepatitis to develop
liver failure but if it does occur it does so very rapidly.
Therefore any patient presenting with jaundice needs to
be carefully evaluated to ensure that they are not going
to develop liver failure
• The most important test of liver function is a test of the
liver’s ability to synthesise proteins of the coagulation

cascade. This is provided by either the prothrombin time
or INR. If there is evidence of coagulopathy then the
patient should be admitted to hospital that day
• Patients presenting with acute liver injury should be asked
a thorough history to try to elicit important risk factors
• Most patients with viral hepatitis can be managed in the
community with symptomatic treatment

PA R T 2 : C A S E S

Treatment of acute viral hepatitis is symptomatic and the
majority of patients recover completely. Most cases can
be managed at home unless there is a suggestion that the
patient has or may develop liver failure (derangement of
coagulation, encephalopathy). This patient has markedly
deranged liver function tests suggesting a severe liver
injury but he does not have evidence of coagulopathy at
this point. Given that he is jaundiced, he should have
daily blood tests until it is clear that he is not developing

A 45-year-old woman presenting
with severe right upper quadrant pain
and jaundice

Mrs Emma Watson is a 45-year-old artist who presents with
a 2-day history of right upper quadrant pain and jaundice.
She has noticed her stools are light and her urine is a darker
colour than usual. She has been seen in the emergency
department and you have been asked to review her. On
examination she is apyrexial, in pain and distressed. Her

PA R T 2 : C A S E S

blood pressure is 130/80 mmHg and pulse is 80 beats per
minute. She has mild tenderness in the right upper quadrant
but no rebound or guarding. Blood tests have returned and
show the following:
Bilirubin
ALT
ALP
Albumin
γ-GT

79 μmol/L
67 iU/L
587 iU/L
39 g/L
784 U/L

What pattern of abnormality is
seen in her blood tests?
She is jaundiced as evidenced by a raised bilirubin. The
alkaline phosphatase and γ-GT are elevated suggesting
that the problem is biliary in nature (i.e. a cholestatic
jaundice). This may occur due to extrahepatic or intrahepatic biliary disease although her history of pain is
suggestive of an extrahepatic cause.

What diagnoses would you wish to
consider at this stage?
The important diagnoses to consider are:
• Posthepatic jaundice from gallstones: A gallstone can
cause an obstructive picture if it becomes lodged
anywhere from the gallbladder to the ampulla of Vater
(Fig. 3.1).

Hepatology: Clinical Cases Uncovered, 1st edition. © Kathryn Nash
and Indra Neil Guha. Published 2011 by Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

46

• Cholecystitis: Inflammation of the gallbladder can
present acutely with pain and derangement of liver function tests (Box 3.1).
• Gallstone pancreatitis: Acute pancreatitis can be precipitated by gallstones becoming lodged in the common
bile duct and is an indication for urgent endoscopic
intervention.
• Perforated viscus: The other differentials for severe
abdominal pain should be excluded, e.g. a perforated
peptic ulcer, appendicitis, kidney stones, etc. Rarely, a
gallstone can erode through the biliary tract and present
as a perforation. If the gallstone reaches the small bowel
it can cause obstruction or gallstone ileus (Fig. 3.2).
• Chronic biliary obstruction: If the history was over a
longer period of time other causes of obstruction (e.g.
stricture to the common bile duct, cholangiocarcinoma
and a tumour in the head of the pancreas) should be
considered. Sometimes these cases present acutely when
an asymptomatic chronic obstruction reaches a critical
aperture of bile duct narrowing.

What are the next steps in management
of this woman?
• Ensure adequate resuscitation: As with the manage-

ment of any acutely unwell patient the first step is to
check that her airway, breathing and circulation are not
compromised. Establishing early intravenous access is a
prudent measure in this scenario in view of the early differential diagnoses.
• Analgesia: Treating her pain is an important early
intervention and intravenous analgesia may be the most
effective way of dealing with this quickly. Opiates can
theoretically increase biliary pressure and spasm and
often non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)
in combination with antispasmodics are used to relieve
pain.
• Further investigations:
䊊 Amylase: to exclude pancreatitis.

• Pain: the classic description of biliary colic is of pain
radiating around like a band from the back. Pain may be

(Murphy’s sign)
• Sepsis: pyrexia, raised white cell count or C-reactive
protein
• Deranged liver function tests: an inflamed gallbladder
often does not cause jaundice as it does not impair bile

flow. If a gallstone becomes lodged in the cystic duct,
however, this can impair bile flow in the common bile
duct and result in jaundice (Mirizzi’s syndrome (see
Fig. 3.1))
• Gallstones are the commonest cause of cholecystitis but it
can occur in their absence (acalculous cholecystitis) as a
result of ischaemia

Box 3.2 ERCP procedure for common bile
duct stones
• The patient is sedated and the endoscopist inserts a side
viewing endoscope into the duodenum
• A cannula is inserted through the sphincter of Oddi into
the common bile duct
• Contrast is injected, outlining the biliary tree (Fig. 3.4)
• A small cut can be made in the sphincter of Oddi using
diathermy (sphincterotomy) which will ease the passage
of gallstones into the duodenum (Fig. 3.5)
• A variety of techniques are available for the endoscopist
to remove stones from the bile duct including crushing
stones, retrieving them with baskets and inflating a
balloon within the bile duct to literally pull them out
• If a bile duct stone cannot be removed endoscopically a
stent can be inserted to bypass the blockage and allow
bile to flow into the duodenum

Mrs Watson has an urgent ERCP performed. This confirms
the presence of a gallstone (Box 3.3) in the common bile

Case 3 51

• The prevalence of gallstones is between 10% and 20% in
Western societies. The vast majority of patients with
chronic gallstones (60–80%) are asymptomatic
• Approximately 80% are cholesterol stones, the remainder
being either pigment or mixed stones
• Cholesterol stones occur in patients who have an increase
in the ratio of cholesterol : bile salts in the bile. Risk factors
include:
䊊 increased age
䊊 obesity and high animal fat diet
䊊 hormonal: female sex, multiparity, contraceptive pill use
䊊 ileal disease or resection
䊊 diabetes
• Pigment stones contain an excess of bile pigments from
excessive red cell breakdown, e.g. haemolytic anaemia
• Clinical presentation when it occurs may be as follows:
䊊 biliary pain or colic (intermittent obstruction of the
cystic duct by a gallstone)
䊊 acute or chronic cholecystitis: this is precipitated by a
gallstone or sludge in the cystic duct (the combination
of raised intraluminal pressure and bile initiates an
inflammatory reaction in the gallbladder wall)

A 45-year-old woman presented with right upper quadrant
pain with symptoms, signs and liver function tests suggesting an obstructive jaundice. Radiology revealed dilated
intrahepatic ducts and a filling defect in the common bile

KEY POI NTS
• The presence of right upper quadrant pain associated with
jaundice is highly suggestive of gallstones. Other causes of
obstruction along the extrahepatic biliary tree need to be
excluded
• Imaging of the biliary tree is vital to provide a prompt and
accurate diagnosis
• Imaging modalities will range from easily accessible
ultrasound to specialised tests such as MRCP or
endoscopic ultrasound

• An obstructed biliary system is prone to biliary stasis and
the risk of infection
• Ascending cholangitis is a medical emergency and requires
prompt resuscitation and antibiotic therapy
• Ascending cholangitis is an urgent indication for ERCP to
alleviate the obstruction and therefore treat the sepsis
• Long-term treatment for gallstones is cholecystectomy,
which is usually performed by laparoscopy

It is important to obtain a histological diagnosis to
confirm the suspicion of pancreatic carcinoma. Several

Case 4 53

• Risk factors include smoking, diabetes, diet, previous
partial gastrectomy and possibly alcohol consumption
• Males are affected more commonly than females and
the majority of cases occur in patients over 50 years
• Classically, pancreatic cancer is described as painless
progressive jaundice. In fact it can be associated with
upper abdominal pain or back pain. Due to anatomical
location of tumours of the head of the pancreas, they
will present with symptoms of jaundice earlier than
tumours arising in the body or tail
• A palpable gallbladder in the presence of jaundice is
unlikely to be due to gallstones (Courvoisier’s law) and it
should alert the clinician to the possibility of a
pancreatic tumour
• There are currently no specific blood tests for pancreatic
cancer. Investigations may confirm jaundice, exocrine
and endocrine insufficiency

Box 4.2 Chronic pancreatitis
• Alcohol is the commonest cause of chronic pancreatitis
• There may be associated strictures of the common bile
duct or pancreatic ducts. The latter may result in
tortuous and irregular pancreatic ducts with associated
calcification
• Acute or chronic inflammation leading to pancreatic
necrosis can result in the formation of pancreatic
pseudocysts. These can cause obstruction leading to
abdominal discomfort or impedence of biliary and
pancreatic drainage

methods are available for obtaining pancreatic tissue
(Box 4.5).
An endoscopic ultrasound confirms a mass within the head
of the pancreas with lymphadenopathy. The mass is seen to
be invading the superior mesenteric vein. A biopsy taken
during the procedure demonstrates adenocarcinoma.

Box 4.4 Extrapancreatic malignancy
• Obstruction from the confluence of the left and right
hepatic bile ducts to the ampulla of Vater may lead to
obstructive jaundice, for example:
䊊 intrahepatic and porta hepatitis: lymphoma,
metastatic carcinoma, neuroendocrine tumour
䊊 common bile duct: cholangiocarcinoma
䊊 gallbladder cancer
• The prognosis may be very different; for example
lymphoma with hepatic dissemination can still have a
5-year survival of 85%, and ampullary cancer, if limited
to the duodenal mucosa, has reported survival rates of
90%
• Histological confirmation is therefore not simply
academic and can alter management

• This is a relatively new concept characterised by an
inflammatory process, with the presence of IgG4

• It is an important diagnosis to consider as it may mimic
clinical features of pancreatic malignancy or benign
strictures in the biliary tree and will respond to
immunosuppression
• The patient may exhibit other features of autoimmune
phenomena (Sjögren’s syndrome, vitiligo, pernicious
anaemia, etc.)

pancreatic histology
• Endoscopic ultrasound with fine needle aspiration or
trucut biopsy
• CT or ultrasound-guided percutaneous biopsy
• Biopsy under direct vision at surgery

What are the possible management
approaches for pancreatic carcinoma?
Surgery
• Surgical resection will depend on the extent of the
tumour and specifically if there has been invasion into
the major vessels including the superior mesenteric vein
and portal vein, evidence of metastatic spread and suitability of the patient for major abdominal surgery.
• Whipple’s procedure, when performed in appropriate
centres, carries a perioperative mortality of 0–3% and the

5-year survival is between 20% and 40%. Figure 4.2 is a
simplified diagram of the procedure. It should be noted
that only 20% of patients are eligible for curative resection and the overall survival for pancreatic cancer at 5
years remains approximately 5%.
Chemotherapy
• Systemic chemotherapy can be given. There is continuing research in this area but at the time of writing life
expectancy has been shown to improve by between 2 to
7 months in those given chemotherapy in large clinical
trials.
• Side effects of chemotherapy include nausea, bone
marrow suppression and hair loss.
• Careful discussion with an experienced oncologist and
patient is vital in deciding the risk : benefit ratio.

the operation (although novel metal stents that can be

䊊 The stent occlusion rate is greater with plastic

Mr Rana goes home with his metal stent and his
jaundice improves slowly over 7 days. He is commenced on

Box 4.6 Palliative care of patients with
pancreatic cancer
Broad principles
• Take a holistic approach considering physical,
psychological, social and spiritual aspects of care
• It is important to involve the GP, district nurses,
Macmillan nurses and palliative care team for
complicated cases or those requiring hospice care
• Communication and support should be provided to both
the patient and the family, including:
䊊 breaking bad news
䊊 end of life care
䊊 support in bereavement
Symptom control
• Medication, e.g. analgesia, antiemetics, etc.
• Nerve block for pain, e.g. coeliac plexus nerve block
• Stent insertion to blocked bile ducts (using ERCP or PTC)
• Bypass surgery: to bypass a blocked bile duct to treat
jaundice
• Palliative chemotherapy

may result in duodenal obstruction leading to gastric
outflow obstruction. This can lead to early satiety and
vomiting occurring shortly after meals. A duodenal stent
can be inserted to relieve the obstruction or a palliative
bypass surgery undertaken.
• Side effects of medication or disease progression: The
cancer itself can be associated with worsening symptoms
of nausea and vomiting. The common analgesics used to
alleviate pain are also associated with side effects of
nausea. Therefore, specialist advice from the palliative
care team is very important for the right combination of
medication but also for the holistic care of the patient, as
outlined in Box 4.6.

• The causes of painless jaundice include benign and
malignant aetiologies
• The type of malignancy is important to determine as the
treatment and prognosis may differ
• The suspicion of pancreatic cancer should be high in the
context of painless jaundice, especially if there are
associated symptoms of endocrine disturbance
• Whipple’s procedure is a potentially curative treatment for
pancreatic cancer but only a minority of patients are
eligible for curative surgery

• In those unsuitable for surgical resection, placement of a
metal stent, to alleviate jaundice, may be appropriate

A 23-year-old woman with vomiting
and epigastric pain

Miranda Smith is brought into the emergency department
by her friend as she has been vomiting and complaining of
epigastric pain. Her friend reports that she broke up with
her boyfriend a month ago and she has become depressed
and increasingly withdrawn. On examination she has
bilateral subconjunctival haemorrhages and is jaundiced with
tenderness on palpation of her abdomen. Liver function
tests reveal:
Bilirubin
ALT
ALP
Albumin

157 μmol/L
6362 iU/L
220 iU/L
32 g/L

What is the most likely diagnosis?
The history of a relationship breakdown and subsequent
depression suggests the possibility that she has attempted
suicide. In a patient presenting with symptoms and signs
of an acute liver injury in this setting, a paracetamol
(acetaminophen) overdose is the most likely diagnosis.
Paracetamol overdose is the commonest cause of acute
liver failure in the United Kingdom and accounts for over
half of cases.

What further questions should
be asked?
• The patient should be asked about the possibility of an

overdose. Collateral history from the friend should be
sought, e.g. were there any empty bottles at home, was
there a suicide note?
• How many tablets were taken? The common threshold
for liver damage to occur from a single paracetamol overdose is 10 g (20 tablets) although patients can sometimes
ingest much larger quantities without sustaining significant liver injury. Significant hepatotoxicity has been
reported following overdose of much smaller amounts,
Hepatology: Clinical Cases Uncovered, 1st edition. © Kathryn Nash
and Indra Neil Guha. Published 2011 by Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

however, particularly if the patient is taking enzymeinducing drugs such as antiepileptics or has chronic
alcohol ingestion.
• When did the overdose occur? It is important to establish how long ago the overdose took place. This will aid
understanding of the significance of paracetamol levels
in the blood and also give an indication of the prognosis
and likely benefit of the specific antedote. Furthermore,
whether the overdose was taken all in one setting or
whether it was staggered over several hours or days
should be ascertained. In the latter case, irreversible liver
damage may already have occurred and the algorithms
commonly used to guide referral for specialist care and
liver transplantation are unreliable.
• Was anything else taken with the paracetamol
tablets? Mixed overdoses are common and can present a
confusing picture. For example, non-steroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID) overdose may also cause
hepatic and renal damage and produce similar symptoms
to a paracetamol overdose. The possibility of additional
ingestion of benzodiazepines or opiates should always be
considered, particularly as paracetamol may be prescribed in tablets that contain opiates in addition, such
as co-codamol or co-dydramol. Overdose of these substances, particularly in combination with alcohol, can
lead to respiratory depression which can be rapidly fatal.
In a mixed overdose drowsiness may respond to a specific
antidote with flumazenil (for benzodiazepines) or
naloxone (for opiates). If the patient does not respond to
these antidotes or has taken a pure paracetamol overdose,
drowsiness is an ominous sign that may suggest encephalopathy and the patient should be immediately discussed
with a liver transplant centre.
• Is there any evidence of pre-existing liver disease? Patients
with pre-existing liver disease who develop a superadded
acute liver injury may be affected more severely. They
may be more likely to decompensate and develop liver
failure. Furthermore, the prognostic markers for paracetamol overdose are not valid in this situation.

A patient presenting with paracetamol-induced liver failure

overdose.

that she hadn’t seen her for 2 days. When she entered her
flat there were empty bottles of paracetamol by the side of
the bed.

What further investigations would
you undertake?
Paracetamol level
Blood for paracetamol level should be taken if an overdose is suspected. In order to interpret the result it is
essential to know accurately when the overdose took
place:
• If the patient presents within 4 hours of overdose, the
blood test should be delayed since serum levels drawn
within 4 hours may not represent peak levels.
• The probability of hepatotoxicity can be ascertained
using the graph in Fig. 5.1. The graph should only be used
in relation to a single acute ingestion.
• A negative paracetamol level does not exclude a paracetamol overdose as liver failure occurs 72 hours after the

Coagulation screen
All patients should have a coagulation screen performed
to look specifically at the prothrombin time or international normalised ratio (INR). It is vital to ascertain
whether the liver damage is causing impairment in its
ability to synthesis proteins. The proteins of the coagulation cascade are synthesised in the liver and disturbance
of this process occurs early in liver failure and may
suggest that referral to a specialist centre is required.
Unless the patient is on warfarin or there is lifethreatening bleeding it is important not to make any
attempts to correct abnormalities in blood coagulation as
this will invalidate important prognostic tests that determine eligibility for liver transplantation. Always discuss
the situation with a liver transplant centre before administering clotting factors to a patient with acute liver
injury.

Case 5 59

• Do not attempt to correct disorders in blood coagulation
without discussing the situation with a specialist
transplant unit first

Assessment of renal function
Paracetamol poisoning can cause direct renal tubular
damage and this may occur early in the course of the
illness. It can take several weeks to resolve and patients
may require renal support even when the liver has fully
recovered. Patients with most other aetiologies of acute
liver failure develop renal failure only when liver failure
is advanced and encephalopathy has developed. Urea
synthesis is impaired in acute liver failure and it is not an
accurate guide to the severity of renal dysfunction. Serum
creatinine levels are therefore preferred for the monitoring of renal function.
Electrolytes
Electrolyte disturbance is common in patients with acute
liver injury.
• Hyponatraemia may reflect sodium depletion from
vomiting.
• Hypophosphataemia can contribute to mortality and
morbidity by inducing confusion and coma and should
therefore be specifically sought and corrected. The causes
are multifactorial including impaired renal tubular phosphate absorption and intracellular movement caused by
disturbance in acid–base homeostasis.
Blood glucose
Hypoglycaemia may follow acute hepatic necrosis and
can lead to impairment of consciousness before the onset
of encephalopathy. Since the classic signs and symptoms
of hypoglycaemia may be masked in acute liver injury,
regular blood glucose monitoring is required.
Liver function tests
Deranged liver function tests are common following
paracetamol overdose but do not correlate with prognosis. Transaminases can rise into the thousands, indicating
hepatic necrosis, but this gives no indication of the ability
of the liver to function.
Arterial blood gas
• Metabolic acidosis is associated with acute liver failure

after a paracetamol overdose and is associated with a

particularly high mortality (>90% if the arterial blood pH
is <7.30 more than 24 hours following the overdose).
• Hyperlactataemia is frequent following paracetamol
overdose. An elevated lactate 15 hours after an overdose
is an ominous sign associated with a poor prognosis. The
presence of an increased lactate at this stage should
prompt discussion with a liver transplant centre.

Chronic liver disease evaluation
If there is evidence of liver failure it is important to consider whether the patient might already have a coexisting
chronic liver disease since this can alter their prognosis
and invalidate the use of some markers for prognosis.
Blood tests should be sent to look for evidence of chronic
viral hepatitis, autoimmune liver disease and metabolic
disorders. A liver ultrasound is required to look for features of cirrhosis such as splenomegaly, ascites or the
presence of a small liver with an irregular margin. The
latter finding needs to be interpreted with caution,
however, since acute necrosis of hepatic parenchyma can
cause the liver to appear irregular and shrunken, similar
to that seen in cirrhosis.

How does paracetamol cause
liver damage?
Paracetamol itself is not directly hepatotoxic. Paracetamol
is converted to a toxic metabolite, N-acetyl-pbenzoquionimine (NAPQI) (Fig. 5.2). This is normally
inactivated by conjugation with reduced glutathione.
After a large overdose, glutathione is depleted from hepatocytes and the toxic metabolite binds covalently with
sulphydryl groups on liver cell membranes leading to
hepatocyte necrosis.

What are the clinical features of
paracetamol overdose?
In the first 24 hours the patient may be asymptomatic
or have mild symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and
epigastric pain. Unless the overdose is mixed with other
substances the patient is usually fully conscious in this
first 24 hours. This can sometimes lead the patient to
think that the overdose has not caused damage and
may delay presentation to medical services. Liver failure
does not usually become apparent until 72–96 hours
after the overdose by which time hepatic necrosis has
already occurred and the specific antidote has limited
efficacy.

Outline the steps involved in managing
a patient with suspected paracetamol
overdose
The initial principles of treating a patient presenting with
a paracetamol overdose are to determine the timing of
the overdose if possible and to assess whether the level of
paracetamol in the blood is likely to cause harm (using
the normogram in Fig. 5.1). The lower line is used
for high-risk patients, including those who regularly
consume excess alcohol, patients taking enzymeinducing drugs (e.g. antiepileptics) and patients who are
malnourished.
If there is a risk of hepatotoxicity the specific antidote
should be given (Box 5.1). The antidote of choice is
N-acetyl cysteine, which is given by intravenous infusion.
It acts to increase the availability of glutathione by producing sulphydryl groups. If treatment is started within
8 hours of suspected overdose then it is usually possible
to prevent serious hepatotoxicity. Treatment started at
later time points is still likely to be beneficial. N-acetyl
cysteine treatment can occasionally cause a hypersensitivity reaction including rash, bronchospasm and hypotension. If this occurs the treatment should be stopped
and the patient given treatment with intravenous hydrocortisone and chlorpheniramine. Once the reaction has
subsided the infusion can be restarted at a lower rate. If
this is not tolerated then oral methionine can be given as
an alternative. It is effective but absorption is unreliable
if the patient is vomiting.

Box 5.1 Management of a patient presenting
with a paracetamol overdose
• Treatment depends on the interval between the
overdose and the time of presentation to hospital:
䊊 if the patient presents within 4 hours of ingestion and
>7.5 g of paracetamol has been taken, gastric lavage
should be considered or activated charcoal given to
reduce absorption
䊊 if 4–8 hours have elapsed since the overdose, blood
should be taken and sent for paracetamol level
䊊 if 8–24 hours have elapsed since the overdose,
treatment should be started immediately whilst
awaiting the results of blood levels. If the
concentration of paracetamol is subsequently found
to be below the treatment level therapy can be
discontinued
• If at 24 hours the patient is well, the INR is normal and
the paracetamol level is <10 mg/L, then N-acetyl cysteine
infusion can be discontinued. If any of these are
abnormal, continue the N-acetyl cysteine infusion
• N-acetyl cysteine should be given without the guidance
of the treatment graph (Fig. 5.1) in the following
situations:
䊊 where the timing of the overdose is unknown
䊊 where the overdose is staggered
䊊 if a patient presents with evidence of severe toxicity
or fulminant hepatic failure regardless of the time of
the overdose

The clinical suspicion is that she has taken a significant
paracetamol overdose and N-acetyl cysteine is started
immediately. A few hours later she becomes increasingly
restless wandering around the ward and pulling out her
intravenous infusion. Further blood tests are taken and the
results are as follows:

Bilirubin
ALT
ALP
INR
Creatinine

217 μmol/L
4316 iU/L
185 iU/L
4.3
256 μmol/L

Case 5 61

She has liver failure as evidenced by encephalopathy and
coagulopathy. She should be referred to a specialist unit
with facilities for liver transplantation (Box 5.2).

Box 5.2 Criteria for transfer to a specialist liver
unit
Patients with any of the features listed below should be
referred immediately to a liver transplant unit:
• INR > 2.0 less than 48 hours after overdose or INR > 3.5
less than 72 hours after overdose
• Renal impairment (creatinine >200 μmol/L)
• Acidosis (pH < 7.3 or lactic acidosis unresponsive to fluid
resuscitation)
• Any sign of encephalopathy
• Evidence of raised intracranial hypertension
(BP > 160/90 mmHg, bradycardia, hyperreflexia, extensor
spasms, poor pupil responses)
Patients with milder abnormalities should also be discussed
as they may deteriorate fast and there may be only a
matter of hours to obtain a donor liver for them.
Furthermore, it is dangerous to transfer a patient once
they have developed cardiovascular instability and cerebral
oedema. If in doubt always discuss cases of severe
paracetamol overdose with a specialist liver unit.

How do you manage a patient with
acute liver failure?
• Patients should be managed in an intensive care unit

and should be in a specialist centre that is used to looking
after patients with liver failure and can consider liver
transplantation if appropriate.
• Patients often have disturbed conscious levels and may
require intubation and ventilation.
• Supportive care is required to maintain fluid balance,
monitor and correct electrolyte disturbances, and to
maintain glycaemic control.
• Renal failure is common and patients may require
renal support in the form of haemofiltration.
• Cerebral oedema is the major cause of death. If signs
of raised intracranial pressure develop, patients should
be given mannitol intravenously as an osmotic diuretic.
This treatment necessitates that the patient is passing
urine; if they are not then fluid should be removed during
haemofiltration.

• Infection may be a problem and patients should be

given prophylactic broad spectrum antibiotic and antifungal agents.
• It is difficult to judge which patients will require liver
transplantation and to time the procedure. National
guidelines have been developed that determine which
patients with acute liver failure can be offered liver
transplantation.*

What other causes of acute liver failure
do you know?
• Seronegative hepatitis: Although this is a diagnosis of
exclusion it is in fact the second commonest cause of
acute liver failure in the UK, with middle-aged females
the most frequently affected. By definition patients have
negative serology tests for viral hepatitis and autoimmune liver disease. Liver failure develops more slowly
than in patients who have taken a paracetamol overdose
(over 5–12 weeks) but the prospect of recovery is lower
and otherwise eligible patients need to be considered for
liver transplantation.
• Acute infection with a hepatitis virus: Acute liver failure
is an uncommon outcome of viral infection of the liver,
occurring in <1% of cases.
• Autoimmune hepatitis: This may present as acute liver
failure. It is usually not amenable to treatment with
immunosuppressive agents and patients should be considered for liver transplantation.
• Drug-induced liver injury: Many drugs other than
paracetamol can cause acute liver failure (Box 5.3).
• Pregnancy-induced liver failure: Acute liver failure is a
rare complication of pregnancy (see Case 9).
• Wilson’s disease: This is exceptionally rare but it may
present with acute liver failure, usually during the second
decade of life. The prognosis is extremely poor and
patients should be considered for liver transplantation.
• Budd–Chiari syndrome: Acute occlusion of the hepatic
veins (Budd–Chiari syndrome) may present with acute
liver failure. Patients usually have abdominal pain,
hepatomegaly and ascites.
• Malignant infiltration of the liver: It is important to
exclude malignant infiltration of the liver with lymphoma, or more rarely carcinoma, as these patients are
not candidates for liver transplantation.
• Others, e.g. ischaemic hepatitis, heat stroke or sepsis.

Box 5.3 Drugs that cause acute liver failure
• Analgesics (e.g. paracetamol, NSAIDs)
• Anaesthetic agents (e.g. halothane, isoflurane,

• Antituberculous agents (e.g. rifampicin, isoniazid)
• Antibiotics (e.g. sulphonamides, tetracycline)
• Antiepileptics (e.g. sodium valproate, carbamazepine,
phenytoin)
• Ecstasy

Miranda becomes drowsy and requires admission to the
intensive care for intubation and ventilation. She is
subsequently transferred to a specialist liver unit. Over the

PA R T 2 : C A S E S

next 24 hours she becomes anuric and requires renal

support with continuous veno-venous haemodiafiltration.
Over the next few days her INR begins to improve and the
rest of her liver function tests slowly recover. She requires
renal support for a further 10 days but her kidneys finally
recover and she is medically fit to be discharged from
hospital.

What must be done before she
is discharged?
Once the patient has recovered from a paracetamol overdose a psychiatric assessment is mandatory to determine
the level of future suicide risk and to ensure that appropriate psychiatric treatment and follow-up is arranged. A
patient who develops liver failure related to a paracetamol overdose may be in hospital for a number of weeks
and it is important that the reason for admission is not
forgotten once the patient has finally recovered.

CA SE REV IE W
This young woman was brought to hospital with abdominal pain and vomiting following a recent relationship
break-up and the development of a possible depressive
illness. The history strongly suggested an attempted
suicide. Her liver function tests were severely deranged
with grossly elevated alanine transaminase, the most likely
cause of which is paracetamol hepatotoxicity. She was

treated with N-acetyl cysteine but developed coagulopathy,
encephalopathy and renal failure and required admission
to the intensive care unit and transfer to a specialist liver
unit. Here her liver slowly improved and she did not
require liver transplantation. Her renal failure persisted for
several days but eventually she made a full recovery and
was referred to the local psychiatrists.

KEY POINTS
• Paracetamol overdose is the commonest cause of acute
liver failure in the United Kingdom and must be
considered in any patient presenting with this clinical
syndrome
• Patients are often well in the first 24–36 hours and do
not develop evidence of liver failure until 2–3 days after
the overdose
• Paracetamol levels are unreliable if blood is taken <4
hours or >24 hours after the overdose or if the overdose
has been staggered
• Early treatment with N-acetyl cysteine (within 8 hours) will
prevent hepatotoxicity in most cases

• In patients presenting late (>24 hours after overdose)
N-acetyl cysteine treatment may still have benefit and
should be given
• The INR or prothrombin time is an important indicator of
prognosis. Before giving blood products to correct
coagulation discuss the case with a liver transplant centre
• Patients with acute liver failure should be discussed with a
liver transplant centre if there is coagulopathy (INR >2 at
48 hours or >3.5 at 72 hours), renal failure, acidosis or
encephalopathy
• All patients who survive a paracetamol overdose must be
referred for a psychiatric assessment

A 4-week-old baby with jaundice
and failure to thrive

Naomi Rogers is a 4-week-old female infant who is referred
for investigation by her health visitor who has noticed
increasing jaundice. Naomi was born at 39 weeks’ gestation
after a normal pregnancy with a normal birth of 3.6 kg. She
was breast fed and initially gained weight but then began to
lose weight despite a good appetite. Both her parents are
well and there is no family history of jaundice or liver
disease.

What is the differential diagnosis of
jaundice in the neonatal period?
Neonatal jaundice should be classified into causes
associated with unconjugated and conjugated
hyperbilirubinaemia.
Unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia
The problem is either overproduction of bilirubin or
inadequate conjugation of bilirubin. There are many
causes:
• Physiological jaundice: About 70% of breast fed infants
develop jaundice in the first week of life. It is not present
at birth, peaks within 2–5 days and typically lasts for less
than 3 weeks. The urine and stools are normal in colour.
It is more severe in premature and low birth weight
babies and tends to last longer in breast fed babies.
Treatment is rarely necessary. The cause is multifactorial
including increased degradation of red blood cells and
immaturity of the conjugating system in the neonatal
period.
• Haemolysis: Excess destruction of red blood cells
results in unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia. The infant
may be jaundiced at birth. Causes of haemolysis that are
seen in the neonatal period are given in Box 6.1.
• Perinatal haematomas: Haemorrhage into tissues provides an increase in the bilirubin load that may exacerbate jaundice.
Hepatology: Clinical Cases Uncovered, 1st edition. © Kathryn Nash
and Indra Neil Guha. Published 2011 by Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

• Gilbert’s syndrome: Probable autosomal recessive disorder characterised by decreased conjugation of bilirubin.
It is usually asymptomatic apart from jaundice and is
often detected as an incidental finding of isolated
hyperbilirubinaemia.
• Crigler–Najjar syndrome: Very rare disorder of
bilirubin conjugation associated with high levels of
unconjugated bilirubin. There is a deficiency of the
bilirubin-conjugating enzyme UDP–glucoronyl transferase. Two types are recognised:
䊊 Type 1: autosomal recessive disorder with total
absence of conjugating enzyme in the liver. Patients
usually die within the first year of life unless a liver
transplant is performed.
䊊 Type
2: Probable autosomal recessive disorder
characterised by reduced activity of the conjugating
enzyme. Treatment for jaundice is usually required but
patients can survive into adult life.
• Hypothyroidism: Hyperbilirubinaemia is unconjugated but the cause is unknown.
• Sepsis: Infection of any site in the neonatal period can
lead to unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia and
jaundice.

Box 6.1 Causes of haemolysis
• Red blood cell membrane abnormalities:
䊊 hereditary spherocytosis
䊊 hereditary elliptocytosis
• Enzyme deficiencies:
䊊 pyruvate kinase deficiency
䊊 glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency
• Haemoglobin disorders:
䊊 sickle cell disease
䊊 thalassaemia
• Immune-mediated haemolysis:
䊊 ABO or Rhesus incompatibility
䊊 other blood type mismatches

Maternal genital herpes can be

and may result in hepatitis with

Conjugated hyperbilirubinaemia
The problem is due to either a process affecting the liver
itself or the drainage of bile from the liver.
• Infection: Jaundice may be caused by primary infection of the liver or as a reaction of the immature neonatal
liver to infection elsewhere. Intrauterine infection
with various organisms can lead to liver infection that
may present with jaundice in the neonatal period (Box
6.2).
• Metabolic: Many metabolic conditions are associated
with conjugated hyperbilirubinaemia in neonates
(Box 6.3).
• Cholestasis: The most important infantile cholangiopathy is biliary atresia characterised by progressive
destruction of the biliary system.
!RED F LA G
• All cases of neonatal jaundice prolonged beyond 3
weeks should be investigated since there are many
serious causes that require prompt investigation and
treatment to prevent problems.

What serious brain abnormality can
complicate neonatal jaundice?
High levels of unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia in the
neonatal period can damage the brain, a condition
known as kernicterus. Free unconjugated bilirubin is

• Congenital
rubella

• Congenital
syphilis

• Toxoplasmosis

Jaundice may be seen in the first
days of life associated with
hepatosplenomegaly. Hepatitis
usually resolves but can occasionally
fluctuate and progressive fibrosis

Congenital syphilis is rare but may
be associated with liver involvement
with jaundice and progressive
fibrosis
Jaundice develops within a few
hours of birth with hepatomegaly

released from albumin and crosses the immature blood–
brain barrier of the neonate. In the brain, bilirubin can
be deposited, particularly in the basal ganglia, causing
irreversible damage. The infant may become restless or
lethargic and frequently develops stiffness in the limbs
and neck, twitching and convulsions. Death may occur
rapidly (within 24 hours); those who survive frequently
have brain damage.
Kernicterus does not occur in conjugated hyperbilirubinaemia as the conjugated form of bilirubin is
unable to cross the blood–brain barrier.
KEY POINT
• High levels of unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia in the
neonatal period require prompt treatment to prevent
severe brain damage

↑Unconjugated
bilirubin

• When was jaundice first noticed? How has it progressed?
Jaundice present on the first day of life is always pathological. Many other causes of jaundice start on the second
or third day of life. Physiological jaundice usually peaks
in the first week and then improves, disappearing by 2–3
weeks. Jaundice continuing to worsen after the third week
requires prompt investigation.
• What has happened to the colour of the urine and stool?
In unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemias the urine and
stool colour are normal. Darkening of the urine and pale
stools are associated with hepatic or extrahepatic causes
of jaundice.
• Is there a family history of anaemia or haemolysis?
• Was there any history of birth trauma, excessive
bruising?
• Did the mother have any infections or problems during
pregnancy?
• Are there any signs of infection in the baby?

• Haemolysis screen
• Thyroid function
• Genetic testing for
abnormalities in
conjugation

Naomi’s mother first noticed jaundice on the second day of
life. It gradually worsened over the next 3 weeks. After birth
the baby passed dark meconium stools for 24 hours
following which her stools became progressively paler and
the colour of her urine darkened.

What investigations should
be performed?
All children with prolonged neonatal jaundice need thorough investigation (Fig. 6.1).
• Bilirubin: Serum bilirubin levels are a guide to the
severity of the jaundice and the risk of complications.
Fractionation of the bilirubin into unconjugated and
conjugated forms is very important in neonates as it
narrows down the differential diagnosis and allows
further investigations to be targeted accordingly.
• Liver enzymes: Elevation in liver enzymes (ALT or
alkaline phosphatase) may suggest a hepatic or extrahepatic cause for jaundice. It is important to note that alka-

line phosphatase levels are typically elevated in the
neonatal period due to bone metabolism.
• Full blood count, blood film and haemolysis screen.
• Thyroid function test: Most infants are screened for
hypothyroidism in the early neonatal period but it is
essential to check that this has been performed.
• Infection screen: Blood should be checked for IgM
antibodies to toxoplasmosis, rubella, CMV and herpes
simplex as well as syphilis and viral hepatitis serology. A
search for systemic sources of infection should be made
including blood, urine and stool culture, chest X-ray and
careful examination of the umbilical stump.
• Metabolic screen: Blood should be sent for α1antitrypsin level and phenotype and a sweat test should
be performed to look for cystic fibrosis. Screening for
rare inborn errors of metabolism should be performed
in consultation with specialists in this area.
• Urinalysis: High levels of urobilinogen are consistent
with unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia. High levels of
bilirubin in the urine suggest a hepatic or extrahepatic
cause for jaundice.
• Liver ultrasound: Ultrasound is necessary to define
whether an extrahepatic biliary system is present and
whether it has a normal appearance.
• Biliary excretion: Radioisotope imaging may be performed to demonstrate whether bile can be excreted
from the liver into the gut.

PA R T 2 : C A S E S

causes isomeric changes in unconjugated bilirubin, converting it to a more polarised molecule which can be
excreted without complications, thus preventing brain
damage.
• Exchange transfusion: Removes unconjugated bilirubin
from the body.

Extrahepatic biliary atresia.

What are the characteristics
of this disorder?
Biliary atresia affects about 1 in 10 000 live births with a
slight female predominance. The aetiology is unknown.
It is characterised by gradual fibrosis and obliteration of
the extrahepatic and intrahepatic biliary ducts. Infants
are usually born at term with a normal birth weight.
Jaundice begins to develop on the second day and gradually progresses, becoming associated with pale stools and
dark urine. There is increasing hepatomegaly and the
infant fails to gain weight despite feeding well. There may
be abnormalities in other organs, e.g. congenital cardiac
disorders or polysplenia.
The following abnormalities are found:
• Conjugated hyperbilirubinaemia.
• Raised alkaline phosphatase (commonly 5–10 times
the upper limit of normal).
• Elevation of transaminases (2–5 times the upper limit
of normal).
• An absent or small contracted gallbladder on ultrasound performed after a period of fasting.
• Absent biliary excretion from the liver on radioisotope
scanning.
• Liver histology revealing expanded portal tracts, portal
fibrosis and portal oedema.

the infant is 2 months old; if surgery is delayed beyond
this it is unlikely to be successful as the small hilar bile
ducts will have disappeared. If the Kasai procedure does
not result in adequate biliary drainage or there is advanced
hepatic fibrosis with portal hypertension at presentation,
patients should be considered for liver transplantation.
Even with a successful Kasai procedure, up to 80% will
require liver transplantation, but many of these can be
deferred until adult life.
KEY POINT
• Surgery for biliary atresia must be performed promptly
(before the infant is 2 months old) to have the best
chance of achieving biliary drainage

Naomi is taken to theatre at the age of 7 weeks. An
operative cholangiogram is performed which demonstrates
the absence of extrahepatic biliary flow, confirming the
diagnosis of biliary atresia. The surgeon performs a Kasai
portoenterostomy. She initially makes good postoperative
progress and her jaundice improves; 10 days following the

operation her jaundice worsens again associated with fever.

The majority of cases are managed by a surgical procedure called a Kasai portoenterostomy (Fig. 6.2). The
obliterated biliary tree is resected and a loop of small
intestine is anastomosed to the proximal common
hepatic duct. This can achieve biliary drainage in up to
85% of cases. The operation should be performed before

A diagnosis of cholangitis is suspected and she is treated
with intravenous antibiotics. Her fever improves but
her jaundice continues to worsen and she develops
splenomegaly and ascites. She is listed for liver
transplantation but unfortunately dies before a suitable
donor can be found.

Case 6 67

CASE REV IE W
This baby was born at term with a normal birth weight.
Jaundice developed on the second day of life and progressively worsened, associated with dark urine and pale stools.
Investigation revealed a conjugated hyperbilirubinaemia
without evidence of neonatal infection or a metabolic
cause for jaundice. Ultrasound imaging failed to demon-

strate an extrahepatic biliary tree suggesting a diagnosis of
biliary atresia. A Kasai portoenterostomy was performed
within 2 months but was complicated by cholangitis. She
developed progressive liver failure and portal hypertension
and died before liver transplantation could be
performed.

• Most babies develop transient jaundice in the neonatal
period (physiological jaundice)
• Jaundice present on the first day of life is pathological
and requires investigation
• Neonatal jaundice persisting beyond 3 weeks requires
investigation
• Differentiation of hyperbilirubinaemia into unconjugated
and conjugated forms is essential to aid diagnosis and
guide further investigation and management
• Untreated unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia can lead to
serious brain damage (kernicterus) and potential death

• Conjugated hyperbilirubinaemia should be investigated by
looking for congenital infections, neonatal sepsis,
metabolic causes and biliary atresia
• If surgery is performed for extrahepatic biliary atresia it
must be performed before the infant is 2 months old to
be successful
• Patients with failed Kasai portoenterostomy or those
presenting with liver failure, portal hypertension or
cirrhosis on liver biopsy should be referred to a specialised
centre to be considered for liver transplantation

Janet Okecha, a 24-year-old HIV-positive Zimbabwean
woman, presents to her GP with jaundice. Two months
previously she was diagnosed with pulmonary tuberculosis.
She had been treated in hospital for 4 weeks and
established on therapy for her tuberculosis with isoniazid,
rifampicin, pyrazinamide and ethambutol. Her liver function

PA R T 2 : C A S E S

tests were normal when she was discharged from hospital.
She has been taking highly active antiretroviral therapy
(HAART) for HIV infection for 18 months.
Her liver function tests are as follows:
Bilirubin
ALT
ALP
INR

165 μmol/L
325 iU/L
163 iU/L
1.1

What is the most likely cause of her
deranged liver function tests?
A reaction to one of the drugs used to treat
tuberculosis.

What other causes should
be considered?
All causes of jaundice should be considered, for example:
(haemolysis, bilirubin conjugation
abnormality).
• Hepatic (parenchymal liver disease).
• Posthepatic (biliary obstruction).
In a woman presenting with this set of problems there
are a number of special considerations:
• Viral hepatitis: She comes from a part of the world
where hepatitis virus infection is common, particularly
hepatitis B. Furthermore, HIV shares common modes of
transmission with hepatitis B and C and co-infection is
frequent. Patients with viral hepatitis (both hepatitis B

and C) who are co-infected with HIV have more severe
liver disease than patients without HIV infection.
• HIV: HIV itself can infect hepatocytes although it is
unclear whether it causes direct damage to the liver. The
liver is frequently involved in HIV infection, however
(Box 7.1).
• Tuberculosis: TB itself frequently infects the liver
although in most cases it is asymptomatic and jaundice
is uncommon. Enlargement of liver hilar lymph nodes as
a result of hepatic TB may result in jaundice by causing
obstruction to bile flow.
• Drug-related liver damage: The drugs used to treat TB
and HIV are frequently associated with abnormal liver
function tests. As several drugs are used in combination
it can be difficult to know which is the agent responsible.
Mechanisms of HAART-related toxicity are given in
Box 7.2.

What would you do?
After taking a full history and examining the patient,
investigations should be undertaken to try to identify the
cause of the jaundice. Even if the diagnosis appears
obvious from the history it is crucial to consider all possibilities as multiple pathologies are frequent and missing
a treatable co-factor such as viral hepatitis can have
serious consequences. The following investigations
should be performed:
• Viral hepatitis serology.
• Immunoglobulins and liver autoantibody screen.
• Metabolic screen (ferritin, caeruloplasmin, α1antitrypsin level).
• Evaluation of conjugated and unconjugated bilirubin
to assess whether there is a prehepatic component to the
jaundice.
• Liver ultrasound.
Further investigation will be dictated by the results of the
above investigations. Figure 7.1 illustrates an algorithm
for the investigation of abnormal liver function tests in
HIV infection.

Case 7 69

Non-specific effects of HIV infection
• Hepatomegaly
• Abnormal liver biochemistry
• Histological changes, e.g. steatosis, portal inflammation
Opportunistic infections
• Mycobacteria (e.g. Mycobacterium tuberculosis, M.
avium-intracellulare, M. kansaii)
• Viruses (e.g. cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus,
Epstein–Barr virus)
• Fungal infection (e.g. Cryptococcus neoformans, hepatic
candidiasis, histoplasmosis)
• Protozoal infection (e.g. toxoplasmosis, cryptosporidium,
Pneumocystis jirovecii (previously known as P. carinii))
Neoplasms
• Lymphoma (Hodgkin’s or non-Hodgkin’s)
• Kaposi’s sarcoma (rare)

Box 7.2 Mechanisms of HAART-related changes
in liver blood tests
• Isolated hyperbilirubinaemia due to interference with
bilirubin conjugation (e.g. indinavir)
• Hepatocyte toxicity (e.g. ritonavir)
• Cholestatic reaction (e.g. nevaripine)
• Mitochondrial toxicity producing steatosis (e.g.
didanosine, stavudine)
• Hypersensitivity reactions (e.g. abacavir)

The blood results exclude viral hepatitis and other causes of
acute and chronic hepatitis. The liver ultrasound is normal.
Her medication is reviewed, the HIV medication, although
associated with hepatotoxicity, has not been changed for 18
months and she had normal liver function tests throughout

ally lead to liver failure. The latter case is rare but associated with a high mortality and the drug must be stopped.
• Rifampicin: Liver injury occurs in less than 5% of
people taking rifampicin. Hepatotoxicity is more
common when rifampicin is given in combination with
isoniazid due to its ability to induce drug-metabolising
systems within the hepatocytes.
• Pyrazinamide: Hepatotoxicity is occasionally seen.

What changes to her medication would
you make?
The first step is to stop all antituberculous drugs. The
most likely cause of hepatotoxicity is isoniazid followed
by rifampicin and finally pyrazinamide. It is not possible
to tell which of these agents is injurious, however, so it is
essential that all are stopped. Ethambutol is regarded as
a non-hepatoxic agent; however it should never be given
as monotherapy due to the risks of developing TB
resistance.
She has had inadequate treatment for her TB infection
and is going to need further treatment. TB can rapidly
become resistant if treated with single agents, therefore
there is no place for starting one drug at a time to see if
it is tolerated. Alternative non-hepatotoxic regimens can
be given (e.g. ethambutol, streptomycin and a quinolone
antibiotic such as moxifloxacin).
Once liver function tests have returned to normal, the
original drugs can be reintroduced sequentially, initially
at low dose and increasing as tolerated to the normal
treatment dose. If there is no further reaction standard
drugs can be continued and the alternative drugs that
were introduced temporarily can be withdrawn. If there
is a further reaction the offending drug can be withdrawn
and an alternative substituted.
Managing drug-induced liver disease in TB infection
is very difficult and requires a multidisciplinary approach
involving a hepatologist and TB physician.

This young woman has HIV infection which is stable on
HAART. She developed abnormal liver function tests and
jaundice shortly after starting treatment for TB. She underwent investigation which excluded prehepatic and posthepatic pathology. Her liver disease screen was normal
making drug toxicity the most likely cause. All the hepa-

totoxic antituberculous agents were stopped and she was
established on alternative agents. Once her liver function
tests had normalised the original drugs were reintroduced
although isoniazid was not tolerated and it was likely
that it was a reaction to this agent that caused her liver
disease.

KE Y P OI NTS
• Patients may have multiple reasons for developing
abnormal liver biochemistry; all possible causes should be
considered even if the history is suggestive of one
particular cause
• HIV infection can result in many different effects on the
liver, particularly opportunistic infections, tumours and
toxicity related to HIV therapy
• Antituberculous therapy is frequently associated with
derangement in liver function tests

• In drug-induced liver injury it is vital to take a careful
history eliciting all recent and past drug exposure
(including non-prescribed agents)
• It is important to stop all potentially hepatotoxic agents
• Patients with TB should not be treated with single agent

On reading though the medical notes and speaking to the
patient you gather the following history: Mr Darren Williams
is an 82-year-old man who was admitted with a collapse the
day before. He has little recollection of the collapse and this
has never occurred previously. He has little medical history
of note and is usually independent and self-caring. There is
no history of liver disease and he is teetotal. On examination
he looks well with a blood pressure of 120/90 mmHg and
pulse of 80 beats per minute. He is jaundiced but there are
no signs of chronic liver disease. The medical team
managing his care have performed a number of tests for his
collapse, including:
ECG: atrial fibrillation but no acute ischaemic changes
Troponin at 12 hours was normal
CK >1000 iU/L
CT head: no evidence of an acute ischaemic event or
intracerebral bleed

What are the main differential
diagnoses that you should consider?
• Ischaemic hepatitis (Box 8.1).
• Sepsis (Box 8.2).

On review of the observation charts from the emergency
department there is documented hypotension when he
arrived the previous day. Collateral history from a neighbour
confirms that he had collapsed for an extended period of
time. Over the next 72 hours he remains stable. His liver
function tests improve to normal by day 5 of his admission
(Fig. 8.1).
His viral serological tests are normal and paracetamol
levels are undetectable on initial serum taken in the
emergency department. He is awaiting a liver ultrasound.
The medical team are planning to commence him on
anticoagulation and discharge him when he suddenly
develops central chest pain. An ECG shows new ST elevation
in the inferior leads. He is transferred to the acute coronary
care unit and given intravenous thrombolysis. A troponin
level confirms an ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI)
and Mr Williams is managed as an acute coronary syndrome
using the standard protocol. A day after his myocardial
infarction he is noted to be jaundiced. On examination he
has an elevated jugular venous pressure and a tender liver
edge. His liver function tests which had become normal are
now markedly elevated.

What is the diagnosis?
The likely diagnosis is right-sided heart failure; it is probable that he has right ventricular dysfunction (an inferior
myocardial infarction) which has caused acute congestive
liver failure. The liver failure is caused by a combination
of ‘backward’ failure due to high venous pressure but also
‘forward’ failure because the right side of heart is unable

• The liver is relatively protected from ischaemia due to its
receiving blood from both the portal vein and hepatic
artery
• During prolonged hypotension the liver is at risk of
ischaemia particularly if this occurs in the presence of
hypoxia and/or ‘backward failure’ from congestive heart
failure
• The clinical presentation is often silent and considered
only when there are highly deranged liver function tests
in the presence of an acute cardiac event or circulatory
collapse
• The patency of the hepatic artery and portal vein should
be considered in cases of hepatic ischaemia
• Depending on the aetiology, ischemic hepatitis is usually
self-limiting. The liver function tests may worsen in the
following days after the insult before improving to
normal with conservative management
• The diagnosis is a clinical one based on the findings
above and exclusion of other causes of acute hepatitis.
If a liver biopsy is performed, in cases where there is
diagnostic doubt, it will reveal centrilobular necrosis
• Careful observation is required for the complications of
acute liver failure that may accompany ischaemia

Box 8.2 Relationship between sepsis and the
liver
• Sepsis can cause a non-specific derangement in liver
function tests. This may be related to sepsis within the
liver (e.g. hepatic abscesses), the biliary system (e.g.
cholangitis) or a generalised septicaemia
• In severe sepsis the associated circulatory collapse may
precipitate an ischaemic hepatitis, especially in the
presence of underlying cardiac dysfunction
• Features of sepsis including a tachycardia, fever, raised
white cell count and elevated CRP will often initiate the
search for a source, but in the elderly they may not be
pronounced

circulation. Treatment of the underling cardiac dysfunction will improve the liver dysfunction. The heart and
liver are linked by a number of conditions shown in
Box 8.3.

Congestion of the liver results in dilated hepatic venules
which appear as dark spots surrounded by paler unaffected liver. The pathological appearance is likened to a
nutmeg kernel (Fig. 8.2). If congestion is severe and longstanding it can lead to fibrosis when it is referred to as
cardiac cirrhosis.

of his previous observations there is documented hypotension. The working diagnosis is ischaemic hepatitis and his
liver function tests improve with conservative manage-

and develops right-sided heart failure. This is associated
with liver congestion and a further episode of liver
dysfunction.

• The dual blood supply of the liver offers greater
protection form ischaemic events. However, prolonged
hypotension in the presence of cardiac dysfunction and/or
hypoxia can lead to ischaemia

The normal physiological changes of pregnancy result in
an increased cardiac output in the third trimester. Due
to the vasodilatation, the blood pressure will actually fall
in the second trimester before returning to normal at
term. There is a fall in serum albumin, urea, total protein
and the haematocrit. ALP and AFP increase in normal
pregnancy (produced by the placenta). Therefore the
blood tests above that cannot be explained by a normal
pregnancy are the low platelet count and elevated
bilirubin and ALT.

1 Diseases caused by the pregnancy (Table 9.1).
2 Diseases unrelated to pregnancy but occurring during
pregnancy.
3 Patients with established liver disease who become
pregnant.
The purpose of the history, examination and investigations are to try and disentangle these possibilities. The
broad principles of investigating abnormal liver tests
should be employed with specific attention to the following areas.
History
• Previous liver disease: Check if there is a history of
previous liver disease.
• Hepatitis B status: This is routinely ascertained in the
antenatal period during the first trimester and should be
looked for in the obstetric notes. If she is known to have
chronic hepatitis B this will have been flagged (the
newborn will need treatment with immunoglobulin and
subsequent vaccination to reduce vertical transmission)
and the possibility of reactivation will need to be excluded.
• Drug history: Pay specific attention to herbal remedies
and antibiotics (tetracycline can induce fatty liver of
pregnancy).
• Foreign travel: Hepatitis A and E are responsible for a
significant numbers of maternal deaths from fulminant
liver failure in developing countries. Travel to endemic
regions should be asked about.
• History of pruritus and family history: She is not complaining of pruritus but this should be specifically
enquired about as it may indicate intrahepatic cholestasis
of pregnancy (ICP). ICP is associated with genetic mutations, so a family history of pruritus of pregnancy is

Investigations
• Chronic liver disease screen (viral serology, autoantibodies, metabolic screen).
• Acute viral infections including hepatitis A, E and B,
HSV, EBV and CMV.
• If there has been foreign travel further viral serology
will be needed depending on the area of travel.
• Pregnancy-related liver disease:
䊊 Check urine for proteinuria
䊊 Haemolysis screen and blood film
䊊 Uric acid
䊊 Bile acids.
• Imaging: Ultrasound has no implications for the
foetus. With modern CT scans the radiation exposure is
reduced due to rapid acquisition times. As this is the

third trimester, the diagnostic benefit will often outweigh
the risks.
• Liver biopsy: The risk of liver biopsy is not increased
in pregnancy but it is reserved for cases of diagnostic
uncertainty and when it will change imminent
management.

Mrs Okegwu has no history of liver disease. She is hepatitis
B surface antigen negative. There is no history of foreign
travel, recent antibiotics or family history. A liver screen
(including viral serology) is sent for. There is very mild
proteinuria, the haemolysis screen is negative and the blood
film shows a neutophilia with giant platelets. An urgent
abdominal ultrasound reveals steatosis and patency of the
normal hepatic vasculature. Following discussion between
the consultant obstetrician and consultant hepatologist, an
urgent CT scan of the abdomen is arranged. This reveals
marked steatosis and a small subcapsular haemorrhage but
no rupture of the liver.

What is the likely diagnosis and
what should the management
plan be:
This woman has presented in the third trimester with
symptoms and radiological features of an acute fatty liver
of pregnancy (Box 9.1). The other major differentials
include pre-eclampsia and the HELLP syndrome (a condition characterised by heamolysis, elevated liver enzymes

and low platelets). The management of all of these conditions involves delivery of the baby.
Mrs Okegwu has an emergency caesarean section. The baby
requires one night on the special care baby unit and then
makes an excellent recovery. Following delivery, Mrs
Okegwu’s liver returns to normal and follow-up imaging
shows resolution of the steatosis and haemorrhage.

PA R T 2 : C A S E S

Box 9.1 Acute fatty liver of pregnancy (AFLP)
• Usually occurs in the third trimester of pregnancy
• Pathology lies in an enzyme defect in the foetus (long
chain hydroxyacyl coenzyme A, which metabolises fatty
acids). If the mother is also heterozygote, she is unable to
metabolise the excess free fatty acids and these are
subsequently deposited in the liver
• Symptoms include nausea, vomiting and right upper
quadrant pain
• CT imaging is often required because of the
associated risk of liver haematomas, haemorrhage and
rupture
• Liver biopsy, if performed, will show microvesicular
steatosis and there is often little inflammation or
necrosis

• There is a risk of fulminant liver failure, renal failure,
disseminated intravascular coagulation, pancreatitis and
fetal mortality
• Will only resolve by delivery of the fetus
• If liver haemorrhage occurs, this is ideally managed
conservatively but needs very careful observation because
of the risk of liver rupture. If this occurs, hepatic surgery is
required and in a minority of cases a liver transplant is
needed as well
• There is a close association between AFLP and other
pregnancy-induced liver disease, in particular HELLP
syndrome and pre-eclampsia. In clinical practice they can
be difficult to distinguish and it may be that they are best
thought of as a spectrum of disease

A 34-year-old teacher presents to her midwife, with nausea
and right upper quadrant discomfort, in the third trimester of pregnancy. Blood tests show a low platelet count and
elevated bilirubin and ALT. The liver screen, including
hepatitis B, is negative. Imaging, including ultrasound and

CT, show marked steatosis in the liver and a subcapsular
haemorrhage. A diagnosis of acute fatty liver of pregnancy
is made and the baby is delivered by emergency caesarean
section. Resolution of the mother’s clinical symptoms and
biochemistry occurs after delivery.

KE Y P OI NTS
• Liver dysfunction in pregnancy can be classified into three
broad areas: (i) diseases caused by the pregnancy; (ii)
diseases unrelated to pregnancy but occurring during
pregnancy; and (iii) patients with established liver disease
who become pregnant.
• Normal physiological changes in pregnancy cause
alterations in baseline blood tests including: albumin,
urea, heamatocrit, AFP and ALP
• The timing of the pregnancy can give clues to the
aetiology of disease

• Investigations such as a haemolysis screen, bile acids and
proteinuria are important tests in pregnancy-related
dysfunction
• Imaging can be helpful in aiding diagnosis and excluding
complications such as rupture of the liver, particularly in
the third trimester
• Liver diseases specific to pregnancy can have similar
features and may be difficult to separate clinically
• Delivery of the baby will improve maternal and fetal
wellbeing in acute fatty liver of pregnancy, HELLP and
pre-eclampsia

Give a differential diagnosis for her
presentation
She was previously well but has rapidly developed ascites
with deranged liver function tests. This is most likely
caused by an acute event, for example:
• Acute liver injury: Acute damage to the liver (e.g. by
viruses or drugs) could account for her becoming rapidly
unwell with deranged liver function tests. Mild abdominal pain is sometimes a feature of acute liver injury.
Whilst some ascites may form, the rapid development of

and Indra Neil Guha. Published 2011 by Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

large volume ascites would be uncommon in an acute
liver parenchymal injury.
• Vascular event: Thrombosis of the hepatic venous
system obstructs blood flow out of the liver, leading to
painful hepatic congestion and ascites. Portal vein
thrombosis produces abdominal pain which may be
associated with gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhoea. In patients with underlying cirrhosis or intraabdominal malignancy, the development of portal vein
thrombosis may cause ascites production.
• Pancreatitis: Acute pancreatitis is a cause of abdominal pain with ascites production.
• Inferior vena cava obstruction: Obstruction of the inferior vena cava (e.g. by thrombosis or intra-abdominal
malignancy) may cause rapid development of ascites.
Oedema of the lower limbs is often a prominent feature.
• Cardiac disorders: Right-sided heart failure or pericardial constriction may cause prominent ascites and hepatic
congestion.

What would you do?
This patient is unwell and requires urgent investigation:
• Serum amylase: Pancreatitis should be considered in
anyone presenting with an acute abdomen.
• Arterial blood gases: Metabolic derangement should
be sought for by performing arterial blood gases
looking specifically for an acidosis or elevation in lactate
levels.
• Abdominal ultrasound with Doppler investigation: She
should have radiological imaging to assess liver size and
echotexture, to look for signs of underlying cirrhosis
(nodular liver with irregular margin, splenomegaly) and
to assess the intra-abdominal vasculature. Views of the
pancreas may be obtained but often this organ is obscured
by gas in the overlying bowel.
• Ascitic fluid analysis: A sample of ascitic fluid should
be sent for biochemistry (protein, LDH, amylase), microscopy and culture and for cytological examination.

What is the diagnosis?
Hepatic venous outlet obstruction (Box 10.1).
Obstruction can arise at any site between the parenchymal central veins and the inferior vena cava (IVC).
Obstruction of the hepatic venules may be called venoocclusive disease and obstruction of the main hepatic
veins may be called the Budd–Chiari syndrome. In the
majority of cases obstruction is caused by thrombosis but
other causes such as tumour invasion or fibrotic webs
may occur.
Box 10.1 Causes of hepatic venous outlet
obstruction
• Myeloproliferative disorder (associated in up to 60% of
cases)
• Coagulopathy (e.g. factor V Leiden mutation, deficiency
of protein C, protein S or antithrombin III, anticardiolipin
antibody, etc.)
• Drugs (e.g. oral contraceptive pill)
• Pregnancy
• Malignancy (e.g. hepatocellular carcinoma, renal cell
carcinoma, adrenal carcinoma)
• Inferior vena cava web
• Infection (e.g. schistosomiasis, amoebic liver abscess)
• Abdominal trauma
• Abdominal radiotherapy
• Idiopathic causes

Describe the venous drainage of
the liver
The liver is drained by three main veins, the right, middle
and left hepatic veins. These veins drain into the IVC just
below the diaphragm (Fig. 10.1). Short hepatic veins
drain the posterior surface of the liver (caudate lobe)
directly into the IVC and are usually spared in hepatic
venous outflow obstruction, allowing the caudate lobe to
become hypertrophic.

Short
hepatic veins

Gallbladder
Figure 10.1 Venous drainage of the liver.

How do patients with hepatic venous
outflow obstruction present?
The classic clinical presentation is with the triad of
abdominal pain, hepatomegaly and ascites. The time
course of the presentation may vary:
• Fulminant hepatic failure develops over a few days.
This is a rare presentation; patients develop jaundice and
rapidly progress to coma and death.
• The acute form develops over a few weeks. Patients are
unwell with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, tender
hepatomegaly and rapid development of ascites.
• The chronic form develops over many months. Ascites
is the classic feature; this may be resistant to medical
management and may be associated with renal impairment. Hepatomegaly may be present with the caudate
lobe in particular being enlarged. The caudate lobe drains
venous blood independently into the IVC so it may not
be involved in the venous obstruction and can develop
compensatory hypertrophy. Patients with chronic venous
outflow obstruction may develop gastrointestinal haemorrhage and splenomegaly.

KEY POINT
• Always consider the possibility of acute hepatic venous
outflow obstruction in a patient presenting with painful
hepatomegaly and ascites

Case 10 79

Investigations need to consider both diagnosing hepatic
venous outflow obstruction and, in addition, investigating the possible cause.
Diagnosis
• Ultrasound can diagnose hepatic venous outflow
obstruction in up to 75% of cases. Echogenic material
may be seen in the hepatic veins or there may be a visible
stenosis of the veins with proximal dilatation.
• CT and MRI may be useful if the ultrasound is not
diagnostic. They may provide additional information,
e.g. demonstrating caudate lobe hypertrophy.
• Hepatic venography may be performed by retrograde
cannulation of the hepatic veins from the IVC. It is of
value in diagnosis and may be important in aiding treatment decision making.
• Liver biopsy is not necessary in many cases as the diagnosis may be obvious from the radiological imaging. If
undertaken, the classic feature is centrilobular congestion. Patients with the chronic form may no longer show
congestion if they have progressed to cirrhosis.
Aetiology
• The most common causes of hepatic vein occlusion are
myeloproliferative disorders and hypercoagulable states,
therefore patients should be considered for referral to a
haematologist for investigation (e.g. prothrombotic
screen and bone marrow examination).
• Cross-sectional radiological imaging may have been
performed to establish the diagnosis; if not, it may be
indicated if intra-abdominal malignancy or infection is
suspected as a cause.

What are the management options?
Treatment varies depending upon the time course of
presentation and the severity of the hepatocellular
dysfunction:
• Fulminant hepatic failure: Urgent liver transplantation
may be required.
• Acute or chronic presentation: Ascites may be managed
with diuretics although up to half of cases are diuretic

resistant from the outset. In selected cases, insertion of a
transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) can
be useful providing it is possible to gain access to the
obstructed hepatic venous system. If these options are
unsuccessful or not possible, liver transplantation may be
required. Patients should be considered for anticoagulant
therapy.
Hepatic venography was performed which demonstrated
complete obstruction in the hepatic veins. Careful
cannulation of the right hepatic vein revealed an elevated
venous pressure with sluggish blood flow. The obstruction
was dilated by inflating a balloon, with improvement in
blood flow and reduction in venous pressure. Next the
middle hepatic vein was cannulated and a balloon inflated,
resulting in improved venous flow and a reduction in the
venous pressure gradient (Fig. 10.2). It was not possible to
cannulate the left hepatic vein. During the procedure a
transjugular liver biopsy was obtained that demonstrated
centrilobular congestion.
Following the procedure her ascites rapidly improved and
her liver function tests returned to normal. She was referred
to a haematologist for further investigation. Bone marrow
examination was normal with no evidence of a
myeloproliferative disorder. Her procoagulant screen
revealed that she has factor V Leiden mutation.

What is factor V Leiden mutation?
Factor V is a protein of the blood coagulation cascade.
The factor V Leiden mutation results in a single amino
acid change and makes factor V resistant to cleavage by
activated protein C. Factor V therefore remains active
and increases the rate of thrombin generation resulting

This young woman presented acutely with the triad of
abdominal pain, ascites and hepatomegaly. Ultrasound
investigation demonstrated obstruction to hepatic venous
flow which was confirmed on venography. She was treated
by dilating two of her hepatic veins, which successfully
decompressed her liver resulting in disappearance of the

ascites. She had several risk factors for developing venous
thrombosis: she was a smoker, she took the oral contraceptive pill and she had a positive family history. Investigation
revealed that she had the factor V Leiden mutation and she
was therefore started on long-term anticoagulation.

• Hepatic venous outflow obstruction can be caused by
occlusion of the hepatic venules, the main hepatic veins
or the inferior vena cava
• The presentation may be acute (including fulminant liver
failure) or chronic
• The main presenting features are abdominal pain, tender
hepatomegaly and ascites

• Myeloproliferative disorders or prothrombotic tendencies
are the commonest underlying causes of hepatic venous
thrombosis
• Treatment options include simple management of ascites
with diuretics, interventional radiological treatments to
open the occluded veins and liver transplantation

Case 11 A 40-year-old woman with lethargy
and pruritus

with a progressive history of tiredness and pruritus. She has
vitiligo and a past history of rheumatoid arthritis that is in
remission.

What are the main differential
diagnoses?
Tiredness is a very non-specific symptom that is associated with many disease processes, both physical and psychological. Pruritus may be due to a primary skin
condition or a manifestation of a systemic illness. Causes
include:
• Skin conditions (e.g. scabies, eczema, urticaria).
• Liver disease (cholestasis).
• Malignancy (e.g. lymphoma, some carcinomas).
• Haematological disease (e.g. polycythaemia rubra
vera).
• Renal disease (chronic renal failure with uraemia).
• Metabolic disease (e.g. hyperthyroidism, carcinoid
syndrome).
• Pregnancy.
• Miscellaneous (e.g. drugs, psychogenic).

Why do people with liver disease get
pruritus?
The exact reason why people with liver disease get pruritus is unclear. It is often a feature of cholestatic liver
disease, when the flow of bile is obstructed either at the
intrahepatic or extrahepatic level. As a result of the inability of the liver to excrete bile, bile acids are retained in
the blood and it is thought that this is what leads to
itching. There is also a suggestion that liver disease leads
to an increase in naturally occurring opioid agonists and
these contribute to the itching.

How would you approach this patient if
you were the general practitioner?
Any patient presenting with generalised, non-specific
symptoms requires a detailed history and examination to
look for a physical cause for their symptoms. A series of
blood tests are required to screen for serious underlying
pathology such as systemic disease and malignancy:
• Full blood count: Anaemia may be associated with
malignancy or renal failure. A haematological disorder or
lymphoma may cause anaemia, polycythaemia or other
changes in the full blood count.
• Renal function: Advanced renal failure may cause
tiredness and lethargy and patients with uraemia may
have pruritus.
• Liver function tests: Cholestatic liver disease is characteristically associated with an elevation in the alkaline
phosphatase. Patients may have other abnormalities of
liver function such as raised bilirubin and aminotransferases. Marked cholestasis can, however, occur in the
absence of jaundice and patients may have a normal
bilirubin.
• Thyroid function tests: Tiredness is a common feature
of thyroid disorders. Pruritus can be a feature of hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism.
• Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR): The ESR is a
non-specific indicator of the presence of disease. If elevated it suggests a systemic inflammatory, infectious or
malignant process.
Physical examination reveals a well looking woman with
palmar erythema but no other signs of chronic liver disease.
She has bilateral xanthelasma. Abdominal examination is
normal. Her blood tests are normal apart from a raised
alkaline phosphatase of 312 iU/L (normal 35–105 iU/L).

What are the causes of a raised alkaline
phosphatase?
Hepatology: Clinical Cases Uncovered, 1st edition. © Kathryn Nash
and Indra Neil Guha. Published 2011 by Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

• Liver disease: Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) is present in

the biliary canalicular membranes of the liver. Levels are

82

PA R T 2 : C A S E S

raised in cholestasis of any cause, whether intrahepatic or
extrahepatic disease. Raised levels may also occur in
hepatic infiltration, e.g. metastatic cancer, and in cirrhosis. In hepatic inflammation levels may also be elevated
but other liver function tests are also frequently abnormal, particularly aminotransferases (e.g. ALT).
• Bone: A different isoenzyme of ALP is produced by
osteoblasts in the bone. It is elevated in Paget’s disease,
growing children, osteomalacia, metastases, hyperparathyroidism and renal failure.
• Other: The placenta secretes its own ALP isoenzyme,
therefore raised levels can be seen in pregnancy. The cells
lining the intestine and the proximal convoluted tubule
of the kidney also produce ALP although it is rare for
enzymes produced from these sites to account for an
elevation in total ALP.

How could you confirm that the
elevated ALP was due to a hepatic
cause?
• Gamma glutamyl transferase (γ-GT) is a microsomal
enzyme that is present in the liver. In cholestasis the γ-GT
rises in parallel with the ALP as it has a similar pathway
of excretion. Therefore a rise in both ALP and γ-GT is
highly suggestive of liver disease. Drugs such as alcohol
and phenytoin induce the activity of γ-GT, thus a mild
elevation of γ-GT alone may be due to moderate alcohol
intake and does not necessarily indicate liver disease.
• The isoenzymes of ALP can be differentiated by electrophoretic separation. In the absence of clinical signs or
other laboratory abnormalities it is occasionally necessary to identify the source of an elevated ALP in this way.
Mrs Wilcox’s γ-GT is elevated at 185 U/L (normal 11–50 U/L).
Further questioning reveals that she does not consume any
alcohol. She is referred to the hepatology clinic.

What key questions should be asked to
help identify the cause of the
cholestasis?
• Pain: The presence of pain would be suggestive of ext-

rahepatic biliary obstruction, particularly that caused by
gallstones.
• Weight loss: Weight loss may indicate a malignant
process, e.g. malignant infiltration of the liver or obstruction by pancreatic or bile duct cancer (known as cholangiocarcinoma), but can also occur in the advanced stages
of cirrhosis.

• Drug history: Many drugs can cause cholestatic hepa-

titis, therefore a full detailed drug history is mandatory.
The history of drug exposure may predate the development of cholestasis by many weeks. Intrahepatic
cholestasis is a common manifestation of drug-mediated
hepatotoxicity and many drugs have been implicated,
including:
䊊 Sex hormones, anabolic steroids.
䊊 Antibiotics, e.g. erythromycin, flucloxacillin, amoxicillin (particularly when given with clavulonic acid as
co-amoxiclav), nitrofurantoin.
䊊 Azathioprine.
䊊 Chlorpromazine.
• Associated disorders: The presence of other autoimmune diseases would point towards an immune-mediated
liver disease such as primary biliary cirrhosis or primary
sclerosing cholangitis.
• Pregnancy: Obstetric cholestasis typically presents
with pruritus. It usually occurs in the third trimester of
pregnancy, ALP levels may be elevated due to placental
or liver production. Serum bile acids are frequently
elevated.

How would you narrow down the
differential diagnosis?
A liver ultrasound is mandatory to determine the level of
biliary obstruction. In extrahepatic biliary obstruction
ultrasound typically demonstrates biliary duct dilatation.
The absence of a dilated biliary system on liver ultrasound is suggestive of intrahepatic cholestasis.
Mrs Wilcox’s hepatologist organised for her to have a liver
ultrasound. This demonstrates that her liver is enlarged but
with a normal echotexture. There is no biliary duct
dilatation.

What further investigations would
you do?
The absence of biliary duct dilatation suggests intrahepatic cholestasis (Box 11.1). A careful drug history must
be taken to exclude drug-mediated cholestasis. Further
investigations include:
• Chronic liver disease screen.
• Liver autoimmune profile and immunoglobulins.
• Chronic viral screen, particularly hepatitis B and C.
• Metabolic screen (ferritin, caeruloplasmin, α1antitrypsin level).
• Consideration for liver biopsy (may not be necessary

disease screen or if there is a clear drug history and the
patient improves on cessation of the drug).

What is the most likely diagnosis?
This woman has symptoms of lethargy and pruritus, intrahepatic cholestasis and a past history of autoimmune
disease. This is suggestive of an autoimmune cholestatic
liver disease. The most likely diagnosis is primary biliary
cirrhosis.

What is primary biliary cirrhosis?
Primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) is a chronic disorder in
which there is progressive destruction of the bile ducts.
The aetiology is unknown but immunological mechanisms may play a part. Patients typically present with
symptoms of fatigue and pruritus. The natural history of
PBC is variable but the majority of symptomatic patients
develop progressive liver disease eventually leading to
cirrhosis (Box 11.2).

What laboratory abnormalities are
characteristic of PBC?
• Raised alkaline phosphatase: High serum ALP is often

the only abnormality in the liver biochemistry. Patients
on treatment frequently have completely normal liver
function tests.
• Mitochondrial antibodies: Antibodies to mitochondria
(AMA) are present in over 95% of patients. The M2
antibody is specific to PBC; a positive AMA screening test
must therefore be followed up with testing for the M2
subtype to prevent false positive results. The presence of
AMA in high titre is unrelated to the clinical or histological picture and may play no part in its pathogenesis. Up

Box 11.2 Features of PBC
• Female to male ratio is 9 : 1
• Age of presentation is typically 40–50 years
• Most frequent in Europe and North America where the
prevalence is c. 50 per 106 population
• Unknown aetiology, possible aberrant immunological
response to an unknown microorganism
• Presence of antimitochondrial antibody (M2) in c. 95%

to 5% of cases have identical biochemical and histological
features without AMA and are termed AMA-negative
PBC.
• Raised serum cholesterol: Cholesterol metabolism is
markedly deranged in patients with PBC leading to
hypercholesterolaemia, which can be severe. Signs such
as xanthoma and xanthelasma may be present. Most
studies suggest that there is no increased risk of ischaemic
heart disease in patients with PBC and hypercholesterolaemia and it remains uncertain whether the hyperlipidaemia of PBC should be treated.
• Raised serum IgM: There is an increased synthesis of
IgM, thought to be due to a failure of the switch from
IgM to IgG during antibody synthesis.
• Raised bilirubin: Jaundice is a late feature of PBC and
patients should be considered for liver transplantation
when this develops.

What disorders are associated with PBC?
• Autoimmune disease: Other autoimmune diseases are

frequently seen in patients with PBC, e.g. rheumatoid
arthritis, Sjögren’s syndrome, thyroid disorders, scleroderma and coeliac disease.
• Bone disease: Bone disease is common in patients with
PBC:
䊊 Osteopaenia and osteoporosis: female sex, malabsorption and a possible direct inhibitory effect of
bilirubin on osteoblasts contribute to osteopaenia.
䊊 Osteomalacia: cholestasis may result in malabsorption of fat-soluble vitamins leading to vitamin D deficiency. Furthermore, sequestration of vitamin D in the
gut by drugs used to treat PBC, such as cholestyramine,
may contribute.
• Others: An association with disorders such as fibrosing alveolitis, renal tubular acidosis and membranous
glomerulonephritis has been reported.

Wilcox demonstrating features of PBC.

Her antimitochondrial antibody is negative. Her hepatologist
suspects that she has PBC based on her history but in the
absence of a positive AMA recommends that she has a liver
biopsy. This demonstrates classic features of primary biliary
cirrhosis including necrotic bile ducts surrounded with early
fibrosis (Fig. 11.1).

What feature is shown by X in Fig. 11.1?
What is it composed of? What other
causes of this liver biopsy feature do
you know?
Figure 11.1 illustrates a hepatic granuloma. This is a collection of immune cells, principally macrophages, which
form in response to an injury that the body cannot eliminate (e.g. chronic infection, chronic inflammation). The
macrophages can fuse to form multinucleate giant cells.
Granulomas may contain necrotic material in their
centre, when they are known as caseating granulomas, a
feature typically seen in granulomas associated with
tuberculosis. In PBC the granulomas are normally concentrated around the portal tracts. Other causes of granulomas on liver biopsy are given in Box 11.3.

After making a diagnosis of PBC what
would you tell the patient?
It is important to inform her that in most cases PBC is a
gradually progressive disorder. She therefore needs to
regularly attend the outpatient clinic to monitor her condition and to screen for treatable complications, e.g.
oesophageal varices and osteoporosis.

Box 11.3 Causes of granulomas on liver biopsy
• PBC (granulomas typically around the bile ducts)
• Sarcoidosis (granulomas thoughout the liver
parenchyma)
• Lymphoma, Hodgkin’s disease
• Infection
䊊 bacterial, e.g. tuberculosis, brucellosis
䊊 parasitic, e.g. schistosomiasis, strongyloides
䊊 viral, e.g. HIV, HCV
䊊 fungal, e.g. histoplasmosis, coccidiomycosis
• Drug hypersensitivity (e.g. phenylbutazone,
sulphonamide)
• Erythema nodosum
• Foreign body (e.g. talc, suture)

The rate of progression of the disease is highly variable.
Patients who are asymptomatic at presentation usually
develop symptoms over 5–10 years. Once symptoms
develop, the median time to progress to liver failure
requiring transplantation is 10 years.

How should she be managed?
• Lethargy: The lethargy associated with PBC may be

disabling. It is important to exclude coexisting treatable
causes of lethargy including depression, anaemia, thyroid
or adrenal disease. Otherwise the patient should be given
symptomatic advice.

• Pruritus:

Cholestyramine: this
non-absorbable
anion
exchange resin binds bile acids in the intestine and
prevents their reabsorption in the ileum and is the
first-line treatment for pruritus in PBC. It is effective
in up to 90% of patients but is unpleasant to ingest and
causes constipation.
䊊 Ursodeoxycholic acid: this is an endogenous bile acid
that can improve the itch associated with PBC. It has
also been shown to improve liver function tests and
slow progression of liver disease. Some studies suggest
that it might delay the need for liver transplantation.
Most patients are therefore given ursodeoxycholic acid
for its role in treating PBC itself.
䊊 Antihistamines: these drugs are usually given at
night and the main benefit is probably related to their
sedative effect.
䊊 Rifampicin: the antibiotic rifampicin has been shown
to be effective in treating cholestasis-associated
pruritus although its mechanism of action is
unknown.
䊊 Opioid receptor antagonists: in patients who do not
respond to the above medications the orally active
opioid receptor antagonist naltrexone may be
beneficial.
䊊 Liver transplantation: rarely patients are refractory
to treatment and so disabled by pruritus that liver
transplantation is considered for this symptom.
• Bone disease: Vitamin D deficiency should be sought
and replacement given if found to be deficient. Patients
should have regular DEXA (dual energy X-ray absorptiometry) bone densitometry and be given calcium supplements or bisphosphonates if appropriate.
䊊

Mrs Wilcox is started on cholestyramine and ursodeoxycholic
acid which control her symptoms and she defaults from

• Exclude hepatocellular carcinoma: Patients with
advanced PBC are at risk of hepatocellular carcinoma,
therefore she should undergo radiological imaging (e.g.
ultrasound) to exclude the development of a tumour as
a cause of her deterioration.
• Exclude a vascular problem: Patients with cirrhosis
may develop a disturbance in portal venous flow due to
the increased stiffness of the liver. Development of portal
vein thrombosis can cause deterioration in liver function
and should be sought by ultrasound with Doppler or CT/
MRI imaging with portal phase contrast.
• Exclude an additional liver disease: Patients with
chronic liver disease who deteriorate should always be
evaluated for the possibility of a superadded liver disease.
Investigations should be undertaken to exclude biliary
obstruction such as that by gallstones (ultrasound), viral
hepatitis or other autoimmune liver disease.
• Exclude drug-toxicity: Patients who deteriorate should
always be asked about any drugs (prescribed or over the
counter remedies) that could have caused liver injury and
precipitated deterioration.
• Consider for liver transplantation: If there is no precipitant for her deterioration identified then she should
be considered for liver transplantation (Box 11.4).
Mrs Wilcox is assessed and placed on the waiting list for
liver transplantation and a suitable donor is found 8 months
later. The transplant is uncomplicated and she is alive and

regular clinic follow-up. Eight years later she re-presents
with jaundice, ascites and a bilirubin of 150 µmol/L.

What management steps would you
consider now?
Whilst it is most likely that her deterioration is due to the
gradual progression of PBC, it is important to exclude
other precipitants for her symptoms:

• Increasing jaundice (generally consider when bilirubin is
approaching 100 μmol/L)
• Intractable ascites
• Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis
• Encephalopathy
• Early hepatocellular carcinoma
• Unacceptable quality of life (e.g. intractable pruritus)

Part 2: Cases

• Chronic hepatitis: Most patients present with nonspecific symptoms such as tiredness and right upper
quadrant pain or are detected incidentally following
investigation for raised transaminases. Clinical examination may reveal signs of chronic liver disease, e.g. palmar
erythema, spider naevi and hepatosplenomegaly.
• Cirrhosis: As chronic autoimmune hepatitis is often
asymptomatic up to 25% of patients may have cirrhosis
at presentation.
• Acute hepatitis: Up to 25% present with an acute hepatitis and may have jaundice.
• Liver failure: Rarely patients present with fulminant
liver failure and liver transplantation is necessary if clinically appropriate.
In the majority of cases there are positive autoantibodies against nuclei (antinuclear antibodies), smooth
muscle actin and occasionally mitochondria. Younger
people may have positive liver kidney microsomal antibodies which define a more aggressive illness.

What conditions are associated with
autoimmune hepatitis?
• Other autoimmune conditions, e.g. autoimmune

thyroid disease, haemolysis, vitiligo, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, etc.
• Overlap syndromes are conditions with features
similar to autoimmune hepatitis but with markers or
symptoms to suggest other autoimmune liver disease.
For example antimitochondrial antibody positivity may
suggest overlap with primary biliary cirrhosis, or biopsy
features of biliary tract inflammation may occur in
overlap with primary sclerosing cholangitis.
• Some drugs can cause a chronic hepatitis clinically,
immunologically and histologically identical to autoimmune hepatitis (e.g. methyldopa, nitrofurantoin, isoniazid). Patients are often female and have positive liver
autoantibodies. Improvement may follow drug withdrawal but relapse occurs if the drug is reintroduced.

• Steroid-sparing
agent
(e.g.
azathioprine):
Immunosuppressive agents with fewer side effects than
corticosteroids are given for maintenance therapy.
Azathioprine is usually given in the first instance; it takes
a few weeks to be effective so the steroid dose should not
be reduced rapidly. Many patients require a combination
of low dose prednisolone (5–10 mg/day) and azathioprine to control disease activity. Some patients are unable
to tolerate azathioprine in which case alternative agents
may be used such as 6-mercaptopurine or mycophenolate mofetil.

is on maintenance treatment with azathioprine (1 mg/kg
body weight) and 7.5 mg a day of prednisolone. Her ALT is
normal and she feels well.

What is her prognosis?
Providing she can maintain a remission her prognosis is
very good as she does not yet have cirrhosis. In some
cases, drug therapy can be withdrawn over a 1–2-year
period and patients remain in remission; however, many
cases relapse once therapy is withdrawn. Histological
remission tends to lag behind clinical remission, therefore a follow-up biopsy 1–2 years after initiating therapy
is often required to guide treatment withdrawal. Many
patients require long-term azathioprine to maintain
remission and some are dependent on a low dose of

steroids as well. A few cases (<10%) develop progressive
disease despite immunosuppression and require liver
transplantation.
Over the course of the next year her steroids are reduced to
5 mg a day. Her diabetes is proving hard to control and her
hepatologist is keen to withdraw steroids if possible. A
follow-up liver biopsy is performed that shows no
inflammatory activity and only minimal fibrosis. Following
this her prednisolone is withdrawn and she remains well on
azathioprine monotherapy.

This 25-year-old woman with a history of autoimmune
disease (diabetes and thyroid) presented with nonspecific symptoms and an elevated ALT. Autoimmune
hepatitis was suspected from her elevated immunoglobulins and positive autoantibodies and this was confirmed

on liver biopsy. She was started on immunosuppressive
treatment with steroids and azathioprine which produced
a biochemical remission. Liver biopsy 18 months later
showed histological remission and her steroids were safely
withdrawn.

KEY POI NTS
• Presenting symptoms of autoimmune hepatitis are
frequently non-specific
• Autoimmune hepatitis may progress to cirrhosis without
any symptoms
• Acute presentation with jaundice and even liver failure
can occur
• Autoimmune hepatitis is suggested by raised
immunoglobulins and positive autoantibodies

• Treatment is with steroids initially to control inflammation
and then the addition of a steroid-sparing agent to
minimise the side effects of long-term steroid use
• Many patients require long-term treatment to maintain
remission

What is the likely cause for the
deterioration?
The most likely diagnosis is ascending cholangitis either
due to: (i) dominant stricture related to PSC; or (ii)
cholangiocarcinoma on the background of PSC.
Mr Davies is admitted to hospital for intravenous rehydration
and analgesia, and antibiotics with ciprofloxacin are
commenced.

What other tests should be organised?
An ultrasound is organised for Mr Davies and this shows no
evidence of duct dilatation or gallstones. A MRCP reveals an
irregular biliary tree with beading but no dominant strictures
(Fig. 13.1).

• Tumour markers can be difficult to interpret in this
setting as they are elevated in cholangitis and obstructive
jaundice from benign or malignant causes. Extremely
elevated levels of CA19.9 can be suggestive of a cholangiocarcinoma but are not diagnostic.
• Cross-sectional imaging should be organised, e.g. a CT
scan.

predisposition
• Strong association with inflammatory bowel disease:

associated inflammatory bowel disease ( in particular
ulcerative colitis)
䊊 approximately 10% of patients with ulcerative colitis
will have PSC
• The presentation of PSC can include symptoms of fatigue,
right-sided abdominal pain, jaundice, fevers and weight
loss

• Blood tests will typically show a cholestatic pattern with
elevation in bilirubin, ALP and γ-GT. Autoantibodies may be
positive but do not have a high sensitivity or specificity
• Diagnosis can be confirmed by MRCP or ERCP (Fig. 13.2),
which may reveal strictures or ‘beading’ of the biliary tree
• In a minority of cases the cholangiogram is normal despite
clinical and biochemical features suggestive of PSC. A liver
biopsy in these cases will aid diagnosis by revealing
periductal fibrosis and ‘onion skin’ appearance (Fig. 13.3)

CASE REV IE W
A 42-year-old man with known ulcerative colitis presented
with deranged liver function tests of an obstructive pattern.
Subsequent imaging, using MRCP, revealed primary sclerosing cholangitis. Two years later he presented with

cholangitis from a dominant stricture in the common bile
duct. A cholangiocarcinoma was confirmed by brushings
taken at ERCP. He had a liver resection following which
he was alive and well with no recurrence 3 years later.

KEY P O I NTS
• There is an association between inflammatory bowel
disease and primary sclerosing cholangitis
• A previous cholecystectomy should not exclude gallstones
as a differential for obstructive jaundice
• The diagnosis of PSC can be made by MRCP, ERCP or
liver biopsy

• The presence of PSC is a risk factor of the development of
cholangiocarcinoma
• Patients with PSC and inflammatory bowel disease are
also at increased risk of developing bowel cancer
• The treatment options for cholangiocarcinoma are limited

Mr Taylor has received blood products for his haemophilia for many years. Prior to 1986, clotting factors
derived from donated blood were frequently contaminated with viruses such as HCV. Nowadays the factor 8
is inactivated by heat or chemical treatment. Furthermore,

What are likely to be Mr Taylor’s major
concerns?
• Is he going to develop liver disease? As a haemophiliac

he is highly likely to have known other people who have
acquired chronic viral infections as a consequence of
having received contaminated blood products. His major
concern is probably going to be that he will develop liver
failure or hepatocellular carcinoma.
• Is he at risk of passing the virus to others?
• Can he get rid of the virus?

What should you tell him about his
diagnosis?
• He has chronic infection with HCV and has active viral

replication.
• Patients chronically infected with HCV are highly

unlikely to spontaneously clear the virus.
• About a third of people develop significant liver

disease; risk factors exist that are associated with an
increased likelihood of progression (Box 14.3).
• Treatments are available for HCV that can cure the
virus in approximately 50% of cases.
• The virus can be passed on to others if there is blood
exposure, e.g. sharing needles, but general household and
sexual transmission is very low and no specific recommendations are made.

Case 14 95

• Acute illness is rarely symptomatic (<15% of cases)
• Most patients (c. 65–80%) with acute infection progress
to chronic infection
• Chronic infection is often asymptomatic, therefore many
people chronically infected are unaware that they carry
the virus
• Blood tests will allow the distinction between prior
exposure and clearance of virus (IgG positive and PCR
negative) and current infection (IgG positive and PCR
positive)
• The stage of liver disease is important to ascertain.
Approximately 25% of patients with chronic hepatitis C
will progress to cirrhosis

Box 14.2 Risk factors for acquiring HCV infection
• Intravenous drug abuse
• Blood products before 1991
• Tattooing or body piercing (particular if in unlicensed
premises)
• Sexual transmission (risk is less than 1% but higher if
there are multiple partners or history of traumatic
intercourse)
• Haemodialysis
• Intranasal cocaine
• Needlestick injuries (less than 5%)
• Vertical transmission (less than 5%)

Box 14.4 Extrahepatic manifestations of HCV
• Eyes: retinopathy
• Skin: porphyria cutanea tarda, lichen planus, vasculitis
(e.g. cryoglobuminaemia)
• Brain: cognition, depression, mood disturbance
• Kidney: vasculitis, glomerulonephritis
• Endocrine: thyroid dysfunction
• Rheumatology: arthritis, myalgia, Sjögren’s syndrome
• Haematology: thrombocytopaenia, lymphoma

• HCV may be detected by a minor elevation in transam-

inases performed to investigate vague symptoms or
found incidentally.
• Patients may present with decompensation of previously asymptomatic liver disease, e.g. jaundice, ascites,
variceal haemorrhage.
• In addition to affecting the liver, HCV can also affect
other organs (extrahepatic manifestations) and these are
shown in Box 14.4.

What investigations should you do?
Assessment of the virus
• It is important to confirm that he is chronically infected
and HCV RNA positive by repeating the test a few weeks
later.
• Establishing which family of virus (genotype) is present
will be helpful in advising him as to his chance of
responding to treatment.
Assessment of the degree of liver disease

Male gender

How do patients with HCV infection
present?
• Acute hepatitis (rare; <15% of cases have a sympto-

matic illness).
• Often there are very few symptoms with chronic HCV

but when present they can be non-specific and include
tiredness, right upper quadrant pain, mood disturbance
and rashes (including porphyria).

• Signs of significant liver dysfunction may include

reduced albumin, prolonged clotting and low platelet
count, raising the suspicion of underlying cirrhosis.
• Liver ultrasound to look for features of underlying
cirrhosis.
• The present gold standard investigation for the staging
of liver disease is histology obtained by a liver biopsy. In
this a case a transabdominal approach may not be suitable, because of the bleeding diathesis associated with
haemophilia, and therefore a transjugular approach may
be more appropriate.
• Non-invasive tests for assessing fibrosis are an emerging area.
Other investigations
It is important to screen for other blood-borne viruses
that he is also at risk of having acquired, e.g. HIV and
hepatitis B virus.

Part 2: Cases

What treatment is available?
writing is pegylated interferon (given as an injection once
a week) and an oral tablet called ribavarin.
• Currently, treatment duration is 24–48 weeks depending on the genotype of virus, viral response to treatment
and underlying liver disease severity.
• The response to treatment is dependent on a number
of factors including the genotype of virus and severity of
the underlying liver disease – those with severe fibrosis
or cirrhosis are less likely to respond to therapy. Currently,
the overall sustained viral response rate (undetectable
virus by PCR 6 months after stopping treatment) is
between 40% and 60% (over 80% in certain genotypes,
e.g. genotype 2 and 3).
• There are common side effects of antiviral treatment
(Box 14.5). The support of well-trained nurse specialists
in viral hepatitis C to support, manage and educate
patients is a cornerstone of managing patients with
chronic viral hepatitis.
• Novel treatments for HCV are currently being tested
in clinical trials.
Mr Taylor is found to have genotype 2 HCV. After a careful
discussion with the patient he elects to have a transjugular
liver biopsy. This reveals mild fibrosis, with no evidence of
cirrhosis, and portal tract inflammation consistent with

What are the likely causes for his
deterioration?
He is showing evidence of liver decompensation; the
major differentials are:
• Progressive liver disease from his underlying chronic
hepatitis C (Box 14.6). The development of cirrhosis in
this man would be unusual (mild fibrosis to cirrhosis in
6 years) in the presence of hepatitis C virus alone. The
other possibility is that he had more severe fibrosis at
diagnosis but this was underscored because of sampling
errors with the liver biopsy.

Box 14.6 Progression of liver disease in patients
with chronic HCV infection
• Progression of liver fibrosis will vary between individual
patients
• Approximately 25% of patients with chronic hepatitis C
will develop cirrhosis
• The starting point of the liver fibrosis will obviously
determine how long it takes to develop cirrhosis (e.g. if
HCV is diagnosed in a patient with no fibrosis it can
take 20–30 years to develop cirrhosis; if they have
moderate fibrosis progression at diagnosis it may be
much quicker)

therapy with pegylated interferon and ribavarin for 6

Box 14.7 Hepatocellular carcinoma and portal
vein thrombosis
• Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) usually develops on the
background of liver cirrhosis in HCV. Once liver cirrhosis
is established the annual incidence of HCC has been
reported to be approximately 5%
• The diagnosis of HCC should be actively excluded in
patients who have a sudden decompensation (see Case
17). Once cirrhosis has been established it is important
for patients to be part of a screening programme for
HCC with 6-month to annual abdominal ultrasounds in
combination with α-fetoprotein
• The treatment for HCC will depend on the size of the
tumour, local invasion and the general health of the
patient
• Portal vein thrombosis can occur in liver cirrhosis due to
portal hypertension (it may also signify the development
of an associated HCC). Doppler examination of the
portal vein may reveal reversal of blood flow and
cross-sectional imaging with triple phase will delineate
the extent of thrombosis

What happens to hepatitis C following
liver transplantation?
• Although HCV primarily infects the liver, small

amounts of virus are present in extrahepatic sites and
infection of the new liver is almost universal after
transplantation.
• In the context of immunosuppression, the progression
to cirrhosis is accelerated with 10–30% patients progressing to cirrhosis within 5 years of transplantation.
• Antiviral treatment can be difficult in this group for a
number of reasons:
䊊 The treatment is less efficacious compared to the
pretransplant setting.
䊊 Side effects of antiviral medication can be more
common and severe in this group.
䊊 Antiviral therapy with agents such as interferon can
potentially precipitate rejection of the graft.
• If significant liver damage develops in the graft, as
assessed currently by liver biopsy, then treatment decisions are undertaken on an individual case basis and at
specialist centres.

What happens to haemophilia after liver
transplantation?
Factor 8 is made in the liver. As the new liver does not
have an error in factor 8 synthesis the patient is cured of
haemophilia.

Mr Taylor was followed up regularly. HCV was detected in
his blood but remained at a low level. Follow-up liver
biopsies showed some mild inflammation, consistent with
hepatitis C, but no significant fibrosis. Four years following
his transplant he remains well. He is in a new relationship

genotype 1 and although he had antiviral therapy he was
unable to clear the virus. Initial liver biopsy revealed mild
fibrosis but 6 years later he presented with decompensated
liver disease. During this time he admitted to drinking

excessively and this contributed to the accelerated liver
fibrosis. Despite abstinence, his synthetic liver function did
not improve and he was considered for liver transplantation. He underwent successful liver transplantation and
although he had some minor inflammation and recurrence
of the virus, he was leading a normal life 4 years after

KEY POINTS
• The symptoms of HCV can be non-specific, such as
fatigue and mood disturbance, and in many cases there
are no symptoms at all
• The majority of patients with acute infection develop
chronic infection
• Testing directly for viraemia in the blood (PCR) will enable
the diagnosis of active infection
• There are established treatments for chronic hepatitis C
that are able to achieve a cure in over half of all cases

• Progression of liver fibrosis to cirrhosis will occur in
approximately one-quarter of patients with HCV
• The time frame of fibrosis progression is variable but is
accelerated by other aetiological agents such as alcohol
• Decompensated liver cirrhosis from hepatitis C is an
indication for liver transplantation
• The recurrence of hepatitis C is common in the
transplanted liver and is associated with accelerated liver
fibrosis

What is the diagnosis?
He has acute hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection based on
the following evidence:
• He has hepatitis as evidenced by a raised alanine
aminotransferase.
• He is positive for HBsAg and therefore has active HBV
infection.
• IgM antibody to hepatitis B core (HBcAb) indicates an
acute infection.
Important features of HBV are given in Box 15.1.

How common is HBV infection?
Worldwide, HBV infection is very common. It is estimated that over a billion people have been infected and
that 400 million people remain chronic carriers of the
virus. The prevalence of infection varies geographically:
• 0.1–2% in low prevalence areas (e.g. Western Europe,
North America and Australasia).

Hepatology: Clinical Cases Uncovered, 1st edition. © Kathryn Nash
and Indra Neil Guha. Published 2011 by Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

Box 15.1 Virology of hepatitis B virus
• DNA virus belonging to the hepadnaviridae family of
viruses
• It has an outer envelope of virally encoded surface
antigen (HBsAg), a viral core that encloses the viral
polymerase and the viral genome – a circular, partially
double-stranded DNA molecule (Fig. 15.1)
• Different antigens are produced during infection and
lead to a variety of antibody responses (see Table 15.2).
Two proteins are produced from the area of the
genome coding for the core protein: the core antigen
itself (HBcAg) and the e antigen (HBeAg). They are
produced from a single mRNA with HBeAg being
initiated several nucleotides upstream from HBcAg. This
produces a short signal peptide on HBeAg that allows it
to be secreted into the blood whereas HBcAg, which
lacks the signal peptide, is confined to the hepatocyte
nucleus

• 3–5% in intermediate prevalence areas (e.g. Eastern

Europe, Central Asia and South America).
• 10–20% in high prevalence areas (e.g. Southeast Asia

and sub-Saharan Africa).

How is the virus transmitted from
person to person?
HBV is spread parenterally, mainly via the blood or
sexual transmission (Table 15.1).

What are the serological changes seen
in acute hepatitis B infection with
spontaneous recovery?
Following infection the first antigen detected is HBsAg
(Table 15.2) – its detection precedes symptoms. Next
HBeAg is detected and core antibodies (IgM and then
IgG) are produced. HBeAg disappears from the serum
accompanied by the development of anti-HBe. Finally,
HBsAg disappears signifying viral clearance and anti-HBs
is produced conferring long-term immunity.

Core antigen
(HBcAg)

HBcAg is an intracellular protein and is not detected in the blood

Core antibody
(anti-HBc)

IgM anti-HBc is the first antibody produced following HBV infection
IgM anti-HBc is the best screening test for acute HBV infection and may be the only antibody detectable
during the window period between the disappearance of HBsAg and the detection of anti-HBs
IgG anti-HBc is produced 2–4 months after infection and usually persists in the blood long term

e antigen
(HBeAg)

HBeAg is produced from the same mRNA as HBcAg. It is initiated several nucleotides upstream producing a
signal peptide that allows HBeAg to be secreted into the blood
HBeAg-positive patients generally have high levels of HBV DNA in the serum and are highly infectious
During acute infection, HBeAg is rapidly cleared and anti-HBe is produced
In chronic infection HBeAg may persist for many years; seroconversion to anti-HBe usually occurs but it may
be many decades after infection
Loss of HBeAg is usually associated with the disappearance of HBV DNA from the serum and liver disease
goes into remission. If this occurs before the patient develops cirrhosis the prognosis is generally very
good

e antibody
(anti-HBe)

Some anti-HBe-positive patients develop a mutation in the precore coding region and develop active viral
replication (HBV DNA positivity) without detectable HBeAg in the blood. This ‘precore mutant’ virus may
cause a particularly aggressive liver injury with rapid progression to cirrhosis

HBV infection

Figure 15.1 Hepatitis B virus particle.

The serological changes of acute HBV infection are
shown in Fig. 15.2.

How may acute hepatitis B infection
present clinically?
• Subclinical infection or anicteric hepatitis: In approximately 70% of patients infection is mild with either no
symptoms at all or non-specific symptoms. The patient
may clear the virus without knowing they have been
exposed to it.
• Icteric hepatitis: A minority of patients develop a significant illness with jaundice (Box 15.2). Examination
may reveal an enlarged tender liver and the spleen may
be palpable. Transient rashes may occur and a few
patients develop lymphadenopathy.
• Fulminant hepatic failure: Rarely (<0.5% of cases)
acute hepatitis B infection results in massive hepatic
necrosis and liver failure. This is characterised by coagulopathy, development of encephalopathy and death if
liver transplantation is not undertaken.
• Extrahepatic presentation: Some patients present with
extrahepatic manifestations of HBV infection, particularly immunological syndromes, e.g. rashes, polyarthritis,
vasculitis or glomerulonephritis.

• Viral prodrome: before the onset of hepatitis the
patient is viraemic, which causes them to feel unwell
with anorexia, nausea, headaches, malaise, abdominal
discomfort and a low grade fever. Cigarette smokers
may lose their taste for cigarettes
• Hepatitis: after 1–2 weeks the patient may develop
jaundice, although not all patients become icteric. At
the onset of jaundice the patient often feels better and
the constitutional symptoms begin to resolve
• Cholestasis: the recovery phase is characterised by
deepening jaundice associated with dark urine and pale
stools due to the development of intrahepatic
cholestasis. During this phase the patient may suffer
from intense pruritus. Finally, the jaundice lessens and in
the majority of cases symptoms resolve over 3–6 weeks

Tom feels unwell for a few days but he gradually improves
and 2 weeks after presentation his jaundice has completely
resolved. Blood tests taken 3 months after his initial

HBV itself is not directly cytopathic to hepatocytes. Liver
damage only results in patients who produce a strong
immune response to the virus when cytotoxic T lymphocytes cause lysis of infected hepatocytes. Amy is in the
‘immunotolerant phase’ of chronic hepatitis B infection
characterised by active HBV replication in the liver, high
levels of HBV DNA in the serum, but minimal immune
response to the virus hence minimal liver damage. She is
well with normal transaminases and if a liver biopsy were
to be performed there would be no evidence of hepatocyte inflammation or necrosis.
In contrast, her husband developed an active immune
response to the virus which is the explanation for him
becoming unwell but also the reason why he cleared the
virus whereas Amy has not. The T-lymphocyte response
to the virus resulted in lysis of infected hepatocytes
causing the rise in transaminases and, in his case,
jaundice.

cleared the infection.
• Hepatitis B surface antibody is positive therefore he
has produced a protective antibody to the virus.

What else should be done?
Hepatitis B infection is a notifiable illness and should be
reported to the Health Protection Agency. It is important
to try to ascertain how he acquired the virus and whether
there is a risk that he could have passed it on to anyone
else. It is important that his wife and family are screened
for the presence of the virus.

How do you interpret her hepatitis B
virus serology?
• The presence of HBsAg confirms that she is an active

carrier of HBV.
• The absence of anti-HBc IgM antibody makes it very
unlikely that this is an acute infection.

Is she infectious?
The antigen HBeAg is a marker of HBV replication and
infectivity. She is HBeAg positive and has a high level of
HBV DNA in the blood indicating that she is very infectious and at high risk of transmitting the virus to others.
The most likely explanation for her husband’s acute
infection is that she has passed the virus on to him either
sexually or via close household contact.

KEY POINT
• In hepatitis B virus infection, patients with a strong
antiviral immune response are more likely to have a
symptomatic illness but are more likely to clear the virus.
The extreme example of this is fulminant liver failure
when the immune response completely eradicates the
virus but causes massive hepatic necrosis resulting in
death unless the patient undergoes urgent
transplantation

What is the explanation for her
abnormal liver function tests?
She is pregnant. In pregnancy the alkaline phosphatase is
frequently elevated as it is produced by the placenta.
The albumin falls as a consequence of haemodilution
due to the increased plasma volume characteristic of
pregnancy.

How should her pregnancy be managed?
She is highly infectious and at risk of transmitting the
virus to her baby at or around the time of birth. Infection
acquired in the neonatal period is associated with a high
risk of progression to chronic infection. As soon as the
baby is born it should be given passive immunisation

Case 15 103

Her pregnancy progresses uneventfully and her baby is given
appropriate vaccination. Two years later her baby undergoes
a blood test to see if he has responded to the vaccine.
Results are as follows:
HBsAg
IgG anti-HBc
Anti-HBs

Negative
Negative
Positive

What do these results indicate?
• He is negative for HBsAg and is therefore not a chronic

carrier of HBV.
• He is negative for IgG anti-HBc indicating that he did

not acquire HBV infection.
• The presence of anti-HBs indicates that he has a pro-

tective immune response against the virus.
The HBV vaccine is a subunit vaccine, containing just
HBsAg. As vaccine recipients are only exposed to this
antigen they only produce anti-HBs, a neutralising antibody that effectively prevents infection. As they are not
exposed to the whole virus, vaccine recipients will not
produce anti-HBe or anti-HBc antibodies (Table 15.3).
Amy remains well in herself and defaults from regular
clinical review. Five years later she is referred back to the
hepatology service by her general practitioner who has
found her to have abnormal liver function tests during

What is the most likely explanation for
her abnormal blood results?
She has probably moved from the immunotolerant phase
into an immunoreactive phase. T lymphocytes are now
recognising intracellular HBV antigens and causing lysis
of infected hepatocytes. This leads to necroinflammation
in the liver and the elevation in ALT. Most exacerbations
of inflammation are asymptomatic, as in this case, but
some are accompanied by symptoms of acute hepatitis.
This immunoreactive phase usually results in seroconversion from a HBeAg-positive to HBeAg-negative state
with the development of anti-HBe (Fig. 15.3a). The ease
with which she passes through this phase of HBeAg seroconversion is important in determining the extent of
liver damage and her long-term prognosis. Some patients
have a suboptimal immune response with recurrent
exacerbations, repeated episodes of necroinflammation
and have a high risk of developing cirrhosis.

What other possible explanations must
be considered?
It is important to exclude other causes of liver disease and
acute hepatitis by taking a full history. She should be
asked about recent drug ingestion including herbal remedies and alcohol intake, and blood tests should be taken
to exclude superadded viral hepatitis (hepatitis A, C, D
and E, CMV, EBV, HSV) and autoimmune hepatitis. A
liver ultrasound should be performed to exclude biliary
disease and to check that hepatic vessels are patent.

What treatments are available to treat
chronic hepatitis B infection?

What has happened now?
She has developed active HBV replication again despite
being HBeAg negative and anti-HBe positive (Fig. 15.3b).
This occurs due to a mutation in the pre-core region of
the virus that permits viral replication even without
HBeAg positivity. If untreated she will be at high risk of
developing progressive liver disease and ultimately
cirrhosis.

• Interferons: These are naturally occurring cytokines

She is established on oral antiviral treatment with the

that have antiviral, immunomodulatory and antiproliferative effects. They are given for a finite period, usually
a year, with the aim of boosting the body’s antiviral

nucleotide analogue tenofovir. Over the next year her ALT
normalises, her HBV DNA becomes undetectable and she
remains well.

CASE RE V IEW
Tom Wong presented with acute hepatitis and serological
evidence of recently acquired HBV infection. He was jaundiced and unwell but rapidly improved and cleared the
HBV infection. Screening of his contacts revealed that his
pregnant wife, Amy, was a chronic carrier of HBV. She was
in the immunotolerant phase of the illness and was very
well. She was, however, HBeAg positive with a high level
of HBV DNA in the blood and therefore highly infectious
and at particular risk of passing on the virus to her baby.
The baby received a combination of passive and active
immunisation which successfully prevented infection.

Amy subsequently developed a flare of hepatitis and
required treatment with interferon. She seroconverted to
anti-HBe with normalisation of liver function tests and
loss of HBV DNA from the blood. Two years later,
however, the HBV DNA became positive again despite the
absence of HBeAg indicating that she had developed a
pre-core mutant virus. She was treated with an orally active
antiviral agent that controlled HBV replication.

• Hepatitis B infection is very common worldwide
• HBV is spread parenterally; vertical transmission is the
commonest mode of transmission worldwide
• Acute infection is frequently asymptomatic but a few may
develop a jaundiced illness. Liver failure does occur but is
very rare
• The best test for acute HBV infection is to look for the
presence of IgM anti-HBc
• HBV is a notifiable disease and all possible contacts should
be screened, particularly sexual partners, first-degree
relatives and household contacts
• Chronic HBV infection is usually asymptomatic

• In the immunotolerant phase patients have high levels of
viral replication (HBeAg positive, high levels of HBV DNA)
but poor immune responses to the virus. They are well
with normal ALT but are highly infectious
• In the immune reactivation phase the immune response
results in necroinflammation in the liver. This can lead to
fibrosis and ultimately progression to cirrhosis
• HBeAg-negative patients can still develop viral replication
if they develop a mutation in the precore coding region
• Antiviral treatment is available in the form of interferon
injections or orally active antiviral drugs

with his university friends. He has become unwell in the past
2 weeks and is now jaundiced with tender hepatomegaly.

What types of infection can HDV cause?

His blood tests reveal:

• Coinfection of HDV and HBV at the same time: This
usually produces a syndrome that is clinically indistinguishable from acute HBV infection. The diagnosis is
confirmed by finding serum IgM anti-δ and IgM
anti-HBc. The infection is usually transient and selflimiting although an increased incidence of acute liver
failure has been reported.
• Superinfection: This occurs when a patient who is
already suffering from chronic HBV infection acquires a
superadded HDV infection. This typically results in an
acute flare of previous chronic HBV and can produce an
unusually severe hepatitis. Diagnosis is confirmed by
finding IgM anti-δ at the same time as IgG anti-HBc.
Following superinfection, progression to chronic HDV
infection is almost invariable.
• Chronic HDV infection: This is a severe form of liver
disease that rarely resolves spontaneously; 60–70% of
patients will progress to cirrhosis. It is characterised by
detection of HDV RNA in the serum.

What is the most likely diagnosis?
He has severe hepatitis and is a chronic carrier of hepatitis B virus (HBV). His HBV DNA levels are negative,
however, making it unlikely that HBV infection is the
cause of his deterioration. The most likely explanation is
that he has acquired another hepatitis virus on top of his
chronic hepatitis B infection. With his history of intravenous drug use hepatitis C or D superinfection is most
likely.
Serology tests reveal that he is HCV antibody negative but
HDV antibody positive with positive HDV RNA.

What is hepatitis D virus?
Hepatitis D virus (HDV or delta virus) is a subviral particle that is incapable of independent existence. It requires
the presence of HBV to complete virion assembly as it
utilises HBsAg to form its outer coat. As a result, HDV
infection only occurs in combination with HBV infec-

How can chronic HDV infection be
treated?
Interferon is the only treatment available for chronic
HDV infection. The main goals are eradication of both
HBV and HDV. Whilst it may control HDV replication,
relapse is frequent when treatment is discontinued.

improves with a reduction in his ALT and bilirubin but a
follow-up biopsy shows that he has developed cirrhosis. His

CASE RE V IEW
Benno Florio is a chronic carrier of hepatitis B virus. He

KEY POINTS
• Hepatitis D virus is a subviral particle incapable of
independent existence
• HDV infection can only occur in patients who have HBV
infection
• Co-infection occurs when both HBV and HDV are
acquired at the same time. Infection is usually transient
• Superinfection occurs when a patient already harbouring
HBV acquires HDV. It is associated with a severe
hepatitis and high risk of progression to cirrhosis

Laboratory tests
Laboratory abnormalities that may be associated with

disease and none of them are specific for alcohol-related

peripheral stigmata of chronic liver disease. His liver is
palpable 3 cm below the costal margin but is non-tender
and the rest of the abdominal examination is normal.

What questions would you ask him?
It is important to try to ascertain how much alcohol he
is drinking. This is often a very sensitive subject and
patients may not tell the whole story. You should ask
open questions at first but follow up with more specific
questions to determine the exact pattern of his drinking.
Ask questions such as:
• What type of alcohol is drunk (beer, wine, spirits)?
• What percentage of alcohol does it contain?
• How many drinks a day or week? Patients often underestimate this so it is helpful to ask in several ways, for
example enquiring about how long a bottle of whisky
lasts, are the measures poured at home (drinks poured at
home are often larger than those in a pub).
• How long have they been drinking at this level?
• What is the pattern of drinking (in the pub with
friends, at home alone, etc.)?
It is also important to try to assess the degree of alcohol
dependency and willingness to change. The simple
‘CAGE’ questionnaire is a useful screening tool to identify patients with alcohol dependency (Box 17.1).

Normal liver function tests are not necessarily reassuring
and do not exclude alcohol-related liver disease.

Radiology
Abdominal ultrasound is the most helpful first step in the
evaluation of patients who have suspected liver disease.
It is important to look for features of liver disease and
also to exclude other causes of liver problems (e.g. biliary
obstruction, hepatic lesions). As with laboratory abnormalities it is important to recognise that a normal liver
ultrasound does not exclude the possibility of liver
pathology.

Hepatic steatosis is the name given to the accumulation
of fat droplets within hepatocytes. Alcohol is an important cause, but it can also be seen in other disorders
including diabetes and obesity. Alcohol metabolism
results in decreased fatty acid oxidation and increased
triglyceride synthesis resulting in accumulation of fat
within the liver, mainly in zone 3 hepatocytes.

What should the patient be told?
• His liver disease is fully reversible at this point. If he

stops drinking the steatosis will resolve and he will have
a normal prognosis from the point of view of his liver.
• He should be warned that if he continues to drink he
could be at risk of developing progressive liver disease.
• He should be encouraged to stop drinking. This needs
to be managed carefully in conjunction with an alcohol
support network due to the risks of alcohol withdrawal
if drinking is abruptly stopped.

and vomiting which often leads the patient to stop

Alcoholic hepatitis should be managed in the inpatient

of anorexia, vomiting and encephalopathy. Patients fre-

nasogastric tube feeding, and there is evidence to suggest
that nutritional supplementation improves outcome.
Vitamin replacement is required, particularly vitamin B1
(thiamine), to prevent development of the devastating
neurological damage of Wernicke–Korsakoff syndrome.
Patients should be monitored carefully as they are at high
risk of developing the refeeding syndrome (Box 17.3).
• Sepsis: Bacterial and fungal sepsis is common and a
frequent cause of death. The presence of fever, a raised
white cell count and inflammatory markers should
prompt a search for infection and consideration of broad
spectrum antimicrobial treatment.
• Renal failure: Patients are at high risk of developing
renal failure. Urine output and creatinine levels must be
monitored carefully and fluid balance disturbances corrected promptly with the aid of a central line if necessary.

despite adequate central blood volume) carries a particularly poor prognosis.
Some patients may be candidates for specific therapy
for alcoholic hepatitis. Corticosteroids are sometimes
used but are associated with increased risk of infection
and bleeding. Pentoxifylline, a potent inhibitor of proinflammatory cytokines especially tumour necrosis factor
alpha (TNF-α), may be of benefit in selected patients. If
the patient survives an episode of alcoholic hepatitis,
support in maintaining alcohol abstinence is vital.

What is his prognosis?
In its severest form alcoholic hepatitis is associated with
a mortality rate of over 50%. The condition often gets
worse for a period of a few weeks after stopping alcohol.
Death usually occurs due to sepsis or renal failure complicating liver failure. Most patients who survive an acute
episode of alcoholic hepatitis and continue to drink
alcohol will progress to cirrhosis.
He undergoes a paracentesis for his ascites and is started on
nasogastric feeding. His condition deteriorates initially with
an episode of chest sepsis complicated by renal failure and
encephalopathy and his bilirubin rises to over 500 µmol/L.
Following antibiotic treatment his condition improves and he
is eventually fit for discharge from hospital 6 weeks later. He

continues to require drainage of ascites for several months
but this eventually resolves. He attends regular follow-up
with the medical team and the alcohol nurse specialist and
manages to maintain abstinence from alcohol. Eighteen
months later he remains alcohol free and has returned to
work. A liver ultrasound demonstrates an irregular
cirrhotic-looking liver but no evidence of ascites.

What is his prognosis now?
The most important factor governing his prognosis is
whether he can maintain abstinence from alcohol.
Despite the fact that he has cirrhosis his expected 5 year
survival is up to 90% if he can remain free from alcohol,
but falls to around 50% if he returns to drinking. Even
with abstinence, however, a few patients develop progressive impairment of liver function or complications
such as diuretic-resistant ascites or encephalopathy in
which case they may be considered for liver transplantation providing they can demonstrate commitment to
life-long abstinence from alcohol. Patients with alcoholic
cirrhosis may develop hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC),
despite abstinence, which results in death or need for
liver transplantation. Therefore patients with cirrhosis
regardless of abstinence should be entered into a surveillance programme to screen for HCC.

Case 17 113

CASE RE V IEW
Ben Smith presented with a history of high alcohol intake,
features of alcohol dependency and abnormal liver biochemistry. At initial presentation he had alcohol-related
steatosis, a reversible condition provided alcohol intake
ceases. Unfortunately he continued to drink and
re-presented 6 months later with the much more serious
condition of alcoholic hepatitis. He was jaundiced and
malnourished and suffered several characteristic complica-

tions of the disorder including sepsis, renal failure and
development of ascites. With supportive care he survived
and his condition improved; 18 months later he was still
abstinent from alcohol. He had cirrhosis but his liver was
functioning well, there were no features of portal hypertension and he was capable of holding down a full-time
job.

• Alcohol is the most common cause of liver disease in the
United Kingdom
• Hospital admissions and deaths related to alcohol use are
increasing exponentially
• Excess alcohol intake can result in disorders of many
different organ systems in the body
• Blood tests and other investigations can be completely
normal despite the presence of advanced liver disease
• Hepatic steatosis caused by alcohol use is a totally
reversible condition if alcohol intake ceases

• Alcoholic hepatitis is a serious condition with a high
mortality rate
• Treatment of alcoholic hepatitis is principally supportive,
involving improving nutrition and prevention and
treatment of renal failure and sepsis
• Corticosteroids or pentoxifylline are used to treat alcoholic
hepatitis in carefully selected patients
• Alcoholic cirrhosis may develop without prior symptoms of

䊊

Mr Wong has no history of liver disease and no family
history or other risk factor for acquiring viral hepatitis. He is
teetotal and the only medication he takes regularly is
losartan 100 mg daily. He has not taken any other
medication including herbal preparations. There is no history
of ischaemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease or
peripheral vascular disease. His blood pressure is
140/90 mmHg, he has a BMI of 35 kg/m2 and his waist
circumference is 110 cm with a waist : hip ratio of 1.5. The
chronic liver disease screen is negative. A liver ultrasound
shows an irregular margin to the liver which has a bright
echotexture. His spleen is enlarged at 14 cm.

What is the most likely diagnosis?
The unifying diagnosis is likely to be non-alcoholic fatty
liver disease (NAFLD) with underlying liver cirrhosis.
Mr Wong has a number of the features of metabolic
syndrome:
• Insulin resistance.
• Hypertension.
• Hyperlipidaemia.
• Increased waist circumference.
In addition there are features that suggest he has significant liver disease:

Case 18 115

• The platelet count is just below the lower limit of

• Only a minority of patients (approximately a third)

normal.
• There is an enlarged spleen and irregular liver margin
on ultrasound.
A liver biopsy may be requested to confirm the diagnosis and the extent of fibrosis and to exclude a dual
aetiology for his liver disease. The decision to proceed to
liver biopsy, however, may vary from centre to centre.
There is a growing utilisation of non-invasive markers of
liver fibrosis (blood tests and liver stiffness estimation
with elastography) and this is likely to change the management algorithm in the coming years.

with simple liver steatosis will progress to NASH and
liver fibrosis. Presently it is difficult to know which
patients will progress and it is an area of intense research.
• Secondary causes of NAFLD are shown in Box 18.2.

• NAFLD is a spectrum of disease ranging from simple

hepatic steatosis to necroinflammation (NASH or nonalcoholic steatohepatitis) to fibrosis and cirrhosis (see
Box 18.1 for histological features).
• It is becoming the commonest cause of deranged liver
function tests in the Western world. Population studies
suggest the prevalence may be as high as 30% in the USA.
• There is a strong association between insulin resistance
and obesity and NAFLD.
• NAFLD is a hepatic manifestation of the metabolic
syndrome but may also aggravate and even initiate the
metabolic syndrome.

• Lifestyle changes remain the mainstay of treatment for

patients with NAFLD. Both attention to reducing calorie
intake and increasing exercise is needed. If this is effective
and sustained then improvement in transaminases are
seen.
• Other features of the metabolic syndrome should be
sought and managed appropriately, e.g. hypertension,
hypercholesterolaemia and diabetes.
• In addition to the liver-related complications it is
important to think holistically about patients with
NAFLD as they are at risk from complications of coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease and both
microvascular and macrovascular complications of
insulin resistance.
• There is continuing research of specific treatments for
NAFLD and emerging areas include insulin sensitising
agents, antioxidants and bariatric surgery.
Mr Wong has a liver biopsy that confirms established liver
cirrhosis with features consistent with NAFLD as the
underlying aetiology. In view of the diagnosis of cirrhosis he

Should you be reassured by the fact
that his ALT has fallen?

What are the risk factors for developing
this lesion?

This illustrates the danger of looking at one liver enzyme
in isolation. As cirrhosis advances it is not uncommon
for the ALT to fall and a normal ALT is not reassuring.
His liver synthetic function has in fact deteriorated as
evidenced by his albumin falling, bilirubin increasing and
PT increasing. The main possibilities for this are:
• Disease progression (from compensated cirrhosis to
decompensated cirrhosis).
• Portal vein thrombosis.
• Hepatocellular carcinoma.
• Sepsis (e.g. spontaneous bacterial peritonitis if there is
underlying ascites).

• Liver cirrhosis is the most common reason for the

development of HCC with over 80% occurring in this
context. Malignancy probably results from continual
cycles of inflammation and repair allowing cumulative
mutations to develop in mature hepatocytes.
• The development of HCC is influenced by:
䊊 Geography (e.g. more common in eastern Asia and
sub-Saharan Africa).
䊊 Disease aetiology (e.g. cirrhosis secondary to viral
hepatitis, alcohol or haemochromatosis is associated
with an increased incidence of HCC compared to cirrhosis secondary to autoimmune hepatitis).
䊊 Gender (males have a higher prevalence).

Small hepatocellular carcinomas are frequently asymptomatic and only detected incidentally or by screening.
Once the tumour becomes large it may cause symptoms
(Box 18.3); by the time it produces symptoms it is rarely
possible to attempt curative treatment.

What is the diagnosis?
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).

• Metastases
• Paraneoplastic syndrome:
䊊 hypoglycaemia
䊊 diarrhoea
䊊 polymyositis
䊊 thromboplebitis
䊊 hypercalcaemia

How is HCC diagnosed?
The diagnosis is usually made by a combination of radiology (preferably at least two dynamic modalities) and
AFP. Often HCC does not produce AFP and a normal
AFP should not necessarily put you off the diagnosis if
the radiology is characteristic. If there is diagnostic
uncertainty a liver biopsy can be considered with
the caveat of the risk of tumour seeding in the needle
tract.

What are the treatment options
for HCC?
Orthotopic liver transplantation
• This is the preferred option for HCC in cirrhosis
because it also removes the background liver which is at
risk of developing further tumours.
• Transplantation has a risk of mortality (less than 10%
in most centres at 1 year).
• For transplantation to be considered the tumour
should not have metastasised, should not have invaded
the portal vein and should be within certain size criteria.
These criteria are currently evolving but good outcomes
are obtained if patients have a single tumour less than
5 cm in diameter or up to three tumours each less than
3 cm in diameter. If these criteria are adhered to, tumour

Box 18.4 Examples of interventional radiological
procedures for HCC
Transarterial chemoembolisation (TACE)
The hepatic artery is catheterised and then an intra-arterial
injection of chemotherapy is delivered into the tumour
vasculature (given in a carrier substance such as lipiodol).
Following this the hepatic artery is embolised using an
agent such as gelfoam (Fig. 18.2).
Patients can experience post-embolisation syndrome
(ileus, transient abdominal pain and fever). If these
symptoms persist a hepatic abscess needs to be actively
excluded.
Radiofrequency ablation (RFA)
Thermal injury is produced using an alternating electric
current at a certain radiofrequency. The procedure can be
performed by image guidance percutaneously or
alternatively under direct vision at laparotomy.

recurrence following transplantation is low and 5-year
survival rates of over 70% are obtained.
Resection of the liver lesion
• For patients with very stable liver disease and no portal
hypertension or for those who are not liver transplantation candidates, surgical resection may be another potentially curative option.
• The selection of patients is important as the more
advanced the liver cirrhosis, the greater the morbidity
and mortality of the operation. Most centres would be
reluctant to resect tumours in the presence of underlying
portal hypertension and advanced liver dysfunction.
• The major disadvantage is that following the resection,
the residual cirrhotic liver still has a propensity for malignant transformation.
• Five-year survivals may reach 70% in selected
cases in high volume centres; the recurrence rate is also
high.
Interventional radiological intervention
• A number of interventional radiology procedures are

currently used for the treatment of HCC (Box 18.4).
• Whilst these treatments have been shown to increase

survival, careful selection is again required. The presence

of cirrhosis. He is referred to the hepatology department for
further investigation.

What would you do next?
As always, when presented with a new referral to clinic it
is vital to begin by taking a comprehensive medical
history. Enquire about specific symptoms related to the
liver, past medical history, current and past medication
and family history. A detailed social history should be
elicited. A full physical examination should be performed; in addition to looking for signs of liver disease
the cardiorespiratory and neurological systems should be
assessed as they may reveal important co-morbidities or
other clues as to the cause of the liver problem.
The ultrasound suggests that he has cirrhosis. Initial
investigation should include a full chronic liver disease
screen to look for the underlying cause.

What further investigations would
you do?
• Alpha-1 antitrypsin phenotype.
• Liver biopsy.
His α1-antitrypsin phenotype comes back showing him to be
homozygous for the Z allele (PiZZ) confirming a diagnosis of
α1-antitrypsin deficiency. A liver biopsy is performed which

Alpha-1 antitrypsin is a serine protease inhibitor (serpin)
involved in controlling inflammatory cascades. It is synthesised in the endoplasmic reticulum of the liver,
secreted into the blood and transported to organs including the lungs. One of its functions is to protect the lungs
by inactivating a variety of proteases including trypsin,
chymotrypsin and elastase present in neutrophils.
The gene for α1-antitrypsin is located on chromosome
14. Approximately 75 different alleles have been
described, the most common are M, S and Z characterised by their electrophoretic mobilities as medium (M),

are shown in Box 19.2.

How do patients with α1-antitrypsin
deficiency present?
jaundice: Approximately 10% of ZZ
homozygotes develop neonatal cholestasis with jaundice.
Jaundice typically develops in the first 2 weeks of life and
may be associated with hepatosplenomegaly. The prognosis is variable, and jaundice disappears in most infants
after a few months but in some cases it may last for up
to a year. Approximately a third of infants develop
normal liver function, a third have inactive fibrosis and
a third develop chronic liver failure and require liver
transplantation.
• Respiratory symptoms: Patients with ZZ α1-antitrypsin
deficiency can develop panacinar emphysema and may
present with symptoms such as breathlessness, cough and
recurrent chest infections. Smokers tend to develop
symptoms at a younger age (<40 years) and usually run
a more severe course. SS homozygotes and MZ or SZ
heterozygotes usually produce enough α1-antitrypsin to
protect the lungs from the effects of elastase in people
who do not smoke.

risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma.

• Neonatal

What is the mechanism of the lung and
liver disease?
A low level of α1-antitrypsin allows unopposed action of
proteolytic enzymes. In the lungs these are able to damage
the alveoli resulting in emphysema.
The liver disease is not due to low circulating levels of
α1-antitrypsin since many phenotypes with a low or
absent α1-antitrypsin do not cause liver damage. Hepatic
pathology is caused by accumulation of α1-antitrypsin,
probably as a result of misfolding of the mutant protein,
which prevents its normal transport from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus. The abnormal
protein is visible histologically as intracellular globules
when stained with diastase/PAS (see Fig. 19.1a). It is
unclear exactly how the accumulation of these globules
leads to liver damage; other genetic or environmental
factors are probably relevant since less than 30% of individuals with the PiZZ genotype develop liver damage.

What is the management of a patient
with α1-antitrypsin deficiency?
Management is largely supportive, including minimising
the damage to the liver from other insults (e.g. alcohol,
obesity). Complications of chronic liver disease should
be managed in the normal way and patients with
advanced disease should be considered for liver transplantation. All patients should be advised not to smoke

to prevent or minimise lung disease. First-degree relatives should be offered screening and given lifestyle
advice if found to be affected.
Mr Simpson is advised to keep his alcohol at a low level and
to refrain from smoking. He runs an uncomplicated course
and at follow up 5 years later has compensated cirrhosis and
stable respiratory disease.

• Haemochromatosis is a disorder of iron homeostasis

resulting in excess storage of iron in the liver and other
organs including the pancreas, heart and pituitary gland.

inheritance.

matosis as the combination of iron studies and genetic
testing may offer enough confirmatory evidence of the
diagnosis.
• Situations where a liver biopsy may be considered is
when there are very high ferritin levels (e.g. greater than
1000 ng/ml), clinical suspicion of severe fibrosis/cirrhosis
exists or a dual aetiology (e.g. alcoholic or nonalcoholic fatty liver disease) is suspected. Furthermore,
although genetic testing is helpful there may not be the
facility to test for non-HFE genetic mutations in clinical
practice.
• A liver biopsy can distinguish between true haemochromatosis (iron distributed in hepatic parenchyma
(Fig. 20.1)) and secondary iron overload, e.g. due to
repeated blood transfusion (iron in Kupffer cells).
• There is emerging interest in imaging techniques; for
example MRI (with adapted software) can detect iron
deposition in the liver.
• The importance of detecting cirrhosis in this group of
individuals is for enrolment into surveillance programmes for varices and hepatocellular carcinoma.

What would be your advice?
Mr Archibald carries two abnormal copies of the HFE
gene. Therefore all of his children will have at least one
abnormal copy. If his wife is also a carrier (approximately
1 : 10 chance) then the children will have a 50 : 50 chance
of being homozygotes. Therefore all the children should
be screened for haemochromatosis with iron studies and
genetic tests. There are psychological and potential financial implications of testing positive for haemochromatosis. Close liaison with genetic counsellors may be
helpful in this situation. If the children are found to have
genetic haemochromatosis they should be referred to a
hepatologist for clinical assessment.

removal of a unit of blood, which contains approximately
250 mg of iron.
• By the time patients present with liver disease they may
have accumulated 20–40 g of excess iron. It can therefore
take several years of weekly venesection to remove the
accumulated iron.
• The therapeutic target is to reduce serum ferritin levels
to below 50 ng/mL. Once this target is reached venesection continues at a lower frequency to maintain the
de-ironed state. Most patients in the maintenance phase
require venesection 3–4 times a year.
• Chelating therapy (e.g. desferrioxamine) is not as
effective as venesection but in patients unable to undergo
venesection this is sometimes considered. The new oral
chelating agents are expensive and are still being evaluated for this indication.

he was finding it increasingly difficult to run and control the

On examination he is restless, he has an intention tremor
and his movements appear generally uncoordinated. His
speech is slurred. Cardiovascular and respiratory
examinations are normal. Examination of the abdomen
reveals a palpable liver and spleen. Initial blood test results
are as follows:

What is the probable diagnosis?
The finding of abnormal liver function tests and hepatosplenomegaly in a young person with neurological
symptoms is highly suggestive of Wilson’s syndrome*
(hepatolenticular degeneration).

What is Wilson’s disease?
Wilson’s disease is an autosomal recessive disorder of
copper metabolism that results in abnormal copper dep-

*Samuel Wilson (1878–1937), British neurologist, who described
four patients with tremor, dysarthria and movement disorders
who were found to have cirrhosis at autopsy.

What are the clinical features of
Wilson’s disease?
There are a variety of ways Wilson’s disease can present
(Table 21.1) and although the disease is very rare it
should always be considered in a young person with cirrhosis or neurological symptoms as it is potentially treatable. Children usually present with hepatic problems
which can range from fulminant hepatic failure to cirrhosis to being asymptomatic and detected during investigation of neurological symptoms. Young adults are
more likely to present with neurological signs of basal
ganglia involvement including motor disorders and
behavioural changes.
Kayser–Fleischer rings† may be seen in the eyes of
patients with Wilson’s disease. They are caused by copper
deposition in Descemet’s membrane in the cornea and
can be seen as greenish-brown discolouration around the
periphery of the cornea. They are difficult to detect in
dark-eyed individuals or patients with jaundice and are
best identified by referring to an ophthalmologist to
perform a slit-lamp examination. Despite their wellknown association with Wilson’s disease, Kayser–
Fleischer rings are not specific for the disorder and can
be seen in chronic cholestasis. They are not always
present in the disorder and are frequently absent in those
presenting with liver disease, particularly children.

What investigations can be performed
to attempt to diagnose Wilson’s
disease?
The most important step is to consider the diagnosis in
the first place. No one test is diagnostic and there are
numerous possible pitfalls in the interpretation of tests
and the diagnosis of Wilson’s disease. Investigations that
may be performed are shown in Table 21.2. In patients
presenting with neurological symptoms the presence of
Kayser–Fleischer rings with a low caeruloplasmin are
enough to make the diagnosis. For patients with hepatic
disease the diagnosis is more difficult but is usually made
if two of the following three abnormalities are found:
• Caeruloplasmin <200 mg/L (85% of cases).
• Positive penicillamine challenge test (>80% of cases).
A 24-hour urine collection is performed after oral administration of the copper-chelating agent penicillamine.
Urinary copper levels of >25 μmol/24 h are strongly suggestive of Wilson’s disease (90% of cases).
• Hepatic copper >250 μg/g dry weight.

• Drugs: Copper chelators remove copper from the

body, which is then excreted in the urine. Neurological
symptoms can worsen when they are commenced.
䊊 Penicillamine: Copper-chelating
agent with side
effects that include skin rash, proteinuria, nephrotic
syndrome and bone marrow depression.
䊊 Trientine: Copper chelator with side effects that are
less common but can still occur.
䊊 Zinc: Reduces copper absorption from the gastrointestinal tract.
• Liver transplantation: All patients presenting with
Wilson’s disease and acute liver failure should be
considered for liver transplantation if appropriate.
Transplantation is also indicated in cases of decompensated cirrhosis.

Notes

Caeruloplasmin

A low caeruloplasmin (<200 mg/L) is suggestive of Wilson’s disease but pitfalls can occur:
• It is an acute phase protein therefore levels may be normal or elevated in chronic hepatitis caused by
Wilson’s disease or if there are coexisting inflammatory disorders
• It is synthesised in the liver therefore levels may fall in acute or chronic hepatic decompensation of
any cause
• Low levels can be found in heterozygotes
• Rare, inherited deficiencies can occur
Serum copper levels are generally unhelpful. Levels may be low (if caeruloplasmin is low) or high (if
copper is being released from the necrotic liver in fulminant liver failure)
Baseline levels may be elevated due to increased clearance of copper, but the test has poor sensitivity
and specificity
One of the most useful tests in the diagnosis of Wilson’s disease
Penicillamine, a copper chelator, binds to accumulated copper and is excreted in the urine
A urine copper exceeding 25 μmol/24 h following penicillamine challenge is suggestive of the Wilson’s
disease
Many features are non-specific and non-diagnostic for the disorder:
• Fatty change
• Mallory’s hyaline
• Features of chronic active hepatitis, fibrosis or cirrhosis
• Copper may be demonstrated by rhodanine staining in cases of established liver disease but this is
also seen in chronic cholestasis
An elevation in copper mass in dry liver specimens is seen in over 80% of patients with Wilson’s disease
The test is only available in a few laboratories and the liver sample must be sent fresh and not put in
formalin
Best detected using slit-lamp examination
Absent in up to 50% of patients with hepatic presentation of Wilson’s disease
Although the Wilson’s disease gene has been identified, over 200 mutations are recognised and
mutation analysis is therefore of limited value in primary diagnosis

What else must be done?
Wilson’s disease is an autosomally recessive disorder,
therefore Brian’s brother is also at risk of having acquired
the disorder and he should be offered screening. If he is
found to have the disorder, treatment should be started
before the onset of symptoms.

CASE REV IE W
This 16-year-old boy presented with neurological symptoms and signs of chronic liver disease. The combination
of these clinical features in a young person is highly suggestive of the diagnosis of Wilson’s disease.

KEY POINTS
• Wilson’s disease is very rare
• The disease results from accumulation of copper in
various organs of the body
• The main modes of presentation are liver disease
(typically in children) and neurological or psychiatric
disorders (adolescents or young adults)
• Diagnosis of liver disease is difficult as individual tests
have pitfalls and are not specific for the disorder
• Treatment involves reducing copper intake in the diet
and drug therapy to eliminate copper from the body
• Patients with acute or chronic liver failure should be
considered for liver transplantation
• Siblings should be offered screening for the disorder

bleed from gastric or duodenal ulcers.
• Mucosal inflammation (oesophagitis, gastritis, duodenitis): Inflammation in the lining of the upper gastrointestinal (GI) tract is common in patients who consume large
quantities of alcohol. This can bleed profusely, especially
in patients with coagulation disorders.
• Mallory–Weiss tear: Repeated, forceful vomiting can
lead to a tear in the mucous membrane at the oesophagogastric junction, which can bleed. This is often seen in
patients with alcoholism. Classically the patient vomits
several times and towards the end the vomit contains
blood.
• Gastric carcinoma: Cancers of the upper GI tract are
seen more frequently in patients with alcoholism and
these may bleed.
• Other causes: Other causes of upper GI haemorrhage
include benign tumours, Dieulafoy lesions, aortoduodenal fistula, coagulation disorders (thrombocytopenia,
warfarin) and congenital diseases (e.g. Osler–Weber–
Rendu). Occasionally patients who are bleeding from
their mouth or nose may swallow sufficient blood to
cause vomiting and present with haematemesis.

department having vomited several times. Soon after he
arrives he vomits a large amount of bright red blood with
clots. You are asked to assess him.

What are the immediate
management steps?
When evaluating any unwell patient you should always
begin with the ABC assessment:
• Airway: An assessment of the patient’s ability to maintain a patent airway is mandatory and if necessary the
airway should be protected either with a pharyngeal
airway or tracheal intubation. Patients having a large haematemesis are at risk of aspiration. Furthermore, patients
with liver disease may be encephalopathic or intoxicated
with a reduced level of consciousness and unable to
maintain a patent airway.
• Breathing: Oxygen saturations should be monitored
and oxygen given by face mask.
• Circulation: The patient should be rapidly assessed for
evidence of hypovolaemic shock (pulse, blood pressure,
capillary refill). Adequate intravenous access should be
established. At least two large bore cannulae are required
to deliver intravenous fluids rapidly. Colloid and crystalloid should be administered in the first instance whilst
further assessment and investigation is taking place.

What is the differential diagnosis
in this patient?
The causes of haematemesis are shown in Fig. 22.1:
• Variceal haemorrhage: This man has a history of
alcohol abuse and may have chronic liver disease, which
can be complicated by portal hypertension and the development of oesophago-gastric varices.

KEY POINT
• A patient with alcohol abuse should not be assumed to
have liver disease and be bleeding from varices. Other
causes of gastrointestinal bleeding are also common in
these patients

bleeding and when it started. Haematemesis with fresh
blood and clots suggests active bleeding in the proximal
upper GI tract. Passage of melaena also suggests bleeding
in the upper GI tract. Passage of fresh blood per rectum,
haematochezia, in the absence of a lower GI source can
suggest a torrential upper GI bleed.
• Previous abdominal pain: A history of abdominal pain
may occur in patients who have peptic ulcer disease.
However, patients can often present with bleeds from
ulcers that have previously been asymptomatic.
• Previous history: Patients should be asked about previous GI bleeding and investigations and any past history
of GI or liver disease or surgery.
• Drug history: It is particularly important to obtain a
detailed drug history. Aspirin, non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and steroids can cause
mucosal inflammation and ulceration. Anticoagulation
with warfarin rarely causes bleeding itself but can increase
the severity of a bleed due to another cause. If patients
are taking iron it may suggest that there has been chronic
blood loss.
• Alcohol consumption: Alcohol use may cause liver
disease with portal hypertension and varices. Patients
who drink alcohol to excess are also at risk of GI inflammation, ulceration, carcinoma and other causes of GI
bleeding.

What are the important things to look
for on examination?
Signs of hypovolaemia
An assessment of blood volume status is vital to guide
fluid resuscitation and to dictate the urgency of further
investigation:
• Tachycardia: This is one of the first signs of hypovolaemia. Its absence, however, does not rule out a significant bleed since young, fit patients may have lost a
considerable amount of blood before developing a tachycardia and patients on β-blockers may be incapable of
mounting a tachycardia. Patients who are dependent on
alcohol may have a tachycardia as part of the withdrawal
from alcohol, which can be misleading.
• Blood pressure: The earliest blood pressure change of
hypovolaemia is a postural drop. In a healthy person,
however, over a litre of blood may be lost before a postural drop is evident. Supine hypotension may not occur
until even larger volumes of blood have been lost. In
contrast, the elderly may develop hypotension and a postural drop after much smaller volume blood losses. Blood
pressure changes may be less reliable in patients with liver
disease as they often have systemic hypotension as a
result of the haemodynamic changes that accompany
cirrhosis.
• Peripheral perfusion: An assessment of circulatory
status can be made by examining end-organ perfusion.
Cold extremities, pallor, delayed capillary refill time,
oliguria and fainting or confusion suggesting cerebral
underperfusion can all be signs of hypovolaemia.
• Signs of liver disease: Splenomegaly and ascites are
signs of portal hypertension and their presence raise the
possibility variceal bleeding. Variceal bleeding is the
cause of bleeding in cirrhotic patients in 50–60% of cases
but, as discussed above, patients should not be assumed
to be bleeding from varices until this has been
confirmed.

What blood tests would you organise in
the accident and emergency
department?
• Full blood count: In acute haemorrhage the haemoglobin is often normal in the first 24 hours, reflecting
total blood loss. If blood loss has been chronic or occurred
previously, the haemoglobin is usually low due to
haemodilution by administered intravenous fluids and
the body’s physiological compensation by retaining extra
fluid. Low platelets may suggest hypersplenism and
portal hypertension.

Case 22 131

impaired synthesis of clotting factors resulting in prolongation of the prothrombin time or a high international
normalised ratio (INR). This can increase the severity of
bleeding and reduce the likelihood of it stopping spontaneously. Patients on warfarin may have a high INR and
that requires urgent correction.
• Urea and electrolytes: An elevated urea may occur following an upper GI haemorrhage due to absorption of
blood in the upper GI tract. Creatinine will usually be
normal unless renal function is impaired.
• Liver function tests: Liver function tests are performed
to evaluate the severity of the liver disease. Patients with
an elevated bilirubin and low albumin may have advanced
liver disease and be at high risk of mortality.
• Blood cross-match: Patients presenting with a large GI
bleed should have blood cross-matched (4–8 units) and
fresh frozen plasma and platelets available if
appropriate.
On examination Mr Ball is pale and jaundiced; he has
multiple bruises and spider naevi over his arms and chest.
Whilst you are assessing him he has two more large vomits
of blood. His pulse is 110 beats per minute and blood
pressure 82/50 mmHg. His abdomen is distended with
shifting dullness. Blood tests are as follows:

What emergency measures are required?
• Urgent resuscitation with blood to replace the blood

loss.
• Coagulopathy needs correction with fresh frozen

plasma and platelets.
• A urinary catheter should be placed and urine output

monitored.
• Insertion of a central line should be considered to

guide further fluid management according to the central
venous pressure. This is particularly important in the
elderly, who tolerate fluid overload or hypovolaemia
poorly, and in patients with liver disease when overhy-

dration may increase pressure in varices and exacerbate
bleeding.
• The on-call endoscopist should be contacted and once
the patient is cardiovascularly stable he will need emergency upper GI endoscopy. This is necessary to identify
the cause of the bleeding and to apply endoscopic
therapy.
Mr Ball is resuscitated and stabilised before being transferred
to the endoscopy department. At fibreoptic endoscopy, a
large amount of blood is seen in the stomach. There is no
active bleeding but large oesophageal varices are present
with red spots indicating recent haemorrhage. The varices
are treated by band ligation (Fig. 22.2).

Why do varices develop at the
oesophago-gastric junction?
Varices develop when there is portal hypertension. This
occurs due to an increase in portal pressure due to either
an increase in portal blood flow or vascular resistance or
both:
Portal pressure = Portal blood flow × Vascular resistance
Liver disease causes an increase in portal vascular resistance by obstruction of the venous channels in the liver
resulting in increased pressure within the portal venous
system. In addition, in advanced portal hypertension
there is also an increased portal flow due to arteriolar
vasodilatation of the splanchnic organs.
An increase in pressure within the portal venous
system leads to the development of a collateral circulation diverting portal blood into the systemic veins via
portosystemic anastomoses. At the gastro-oesophageal
junction varices develop between the oesophageal branch
of the left gastric vein (which drains into the portal vein)
and the oesophageal veins draining into the azygos veins
(systemic circulation). Other clinically important anastomoses occur at sites where the portal and systemic veins
come together (Fig. 22.3):
• Rectal varices – anastomoses between the superior
(portal) and inferior (systemic) rectal veins.
• Umbilicus – the recanalised umbilical vein in the
round ligament (ligamentum teres) drains into the epigastric veins to form dilated varices over the abdominal
wall (caput medusa).
• Stomal varices – collaterals can develop at the site of
previous surgery such as around an ileostomy or
colostomy.

Bands around oesophageal varices

Figure 22.2 Oesophageal varices viewed endoscopically before (a) and after (b) band ligation.

In health, the portal venous pressure is usually
4–8 mmHg. There is normally a gradient of approximately 3 mmHg across the liver from the portal (c.
7 mmHg) to the hepatic (c. 4 mmHg) venous systems;
this is known as the hepatic venous pressure gradient.
Portal hypertension occurs when this gradient exceeds
5 mmHg and varices may then form. Varices rarely bleed
unless the pressure gradient exceeds 12 mmHg (Fig.
22.4).

How should bleeding oesophago-gastric
varices be managed?
Endoscopic therapy
Endoscopic therapy is the most important step in the
management of bleeding varices. Two approaches are
available: sclerotherapy and band ligation.
• Sclerotherapy: This involves injection of a sclerosing
material (e.g. ethanolamine) either directly into or alongside a varix and will control bleeding in 80–90% of cases.
Complications include the development of oesophageal
ulcers and strictures, oesophageal perforation, fever chest
pain and mediastinitis.

• Band ligation: This has largely superseded sclerother-

apy. The varix is sucked into a ligator, which is positioned
on the end of the endoscope, and a rubber band is then
placed around the varix (see Fig. 22.2). Banding and sclerotherapy are comparable in their ability to control
bleeding but there are fewer complications with banding.
Pharmacological therapy
• Terlipressin is a synthetic analogue of vasopressin. It is

a powerful vasoconstrictor, is long acting and can be
given by bolus. It reduces blood flow to the splanchnic
organs thereby reducing portal blood flow and portal
pressure. It has fewer side effects than vasopressin but can
still cause peripheral ischaemia.
• Octreotide is a synthetic peptide of somatostatin that
causes splanchnic vasoconstriction and reduces portal
pressure. It is virtually free of side effects but needs to be
given by continuous infusion. If there is clinical suspicion
that the patient might be having a variceal bleed then it
may be justified to give pharmacological therapy prior to
endoscopy since this will reduce portal pressure and
permit earlier control of bleeding and may facilitate later
endoscopic procedures.

What other management steps should
be undertaken?
• Antibiotics: Approximately 20% of patients with

variceal haemorrhage will suffer from an infection when
they are hospitalised and invasive procedures will further
increase the risk. Patients should receive prophylactic
antibiotics such as third generation cephalosporin or ciprofloxacin as evidence has shown that they reduce
rebleeding and mortality.
• Lactulose: Patients with liver disease who have a large
GI bleed are at risk of developing encephalopathy.
Laxatives (e.g. lactulose) should be prescribed to clean
out the blood from the GI tract.

What measures are available if
endoscopic and pharmacological
therapies do not control the bleeding?
Oesophageal tamponade
Balloon tamponade aims to obtain temporary haemostasis by direct compression of the varices (Figs 22.5 and
22.6). It is rarely required nowadays due to advances in
endoscopic and pharmacological therapy. Its main use is
to gain temporary control of bleeding while awaiting
more definitive treatment. A Sengstaken–Blakemore
tube has two balloons, oesophageal and gastric. The
lower, gastric, balloon is inflated in the stomach and
the tube pulled back so that this balloon impacts at the
oesophago-gastric junction. Compressing the varices
here reduces flow into the oesophageal varices and in
most cases arrests bleeding. Rarely, it is necessary to

inflate the upper oesophageal balloon to directly tamponade the oesophageal varices. Whilst use of a
Sengstaken–Blakemore tube may be life saving in cases
of massive haemorrhage it is associated with serious
complications, including aspiration pneumonia and
oesophageal perforation.
Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic
shunt (TIPS)
Intrahepatic portosystemic shunting is now the mainstay
for treatment of variceal bleeding where other methods
have failed (Figs 22.7 and 22.8). Via a right internal
jugular puncture, the hepatic veins are accessed under
fluoroscopic guidance. A needle is then advanced into the
hepatic parenchyma and contrast is injected to guide
passage into the portal vein. The tract is then dilated and
a stent placed. This acts as a ‘bypass’ for a proportion of
the portal blood, resulting in a reduction in portal pressure and collapse of the varices. During the procedure the
radiologist can directly access the portal vein and via
this route can embolise the varices to prevent further
bleeding (Fig. 22.9).
Emergency surgery
Due to the advent of TIPS, emergency surgery for variceal
haemorrhage is rarely performed nowadays. Occasionally
when a TIPS is not technically possible surgery is required.
Most surgical procedures involve creating a shunt

Portal vein

between the portal and systemic circulations to decompress the portal system, e.g. splenorenal shunt, mesocaval
shunt or portocaval shunt. Alternatively, direct staple
transection of the oesophagus may be performed to
control bleeding. Surgery has a high mortality risk and
following successful shunt surgery there is a high risk of
encephalopathy.
Liver transplantation
Variceal bleeding is rarely a direct indication for liver
transplantation but patients who have chronic liver
disease should always be evaluated for transplantation.
Mr Ball is assessed by the critical care team, he is sedated
and his trachea intubated to protect his airway from
aspiration. A Sengstaken–Blakemore tube is inserted to
temporarily control the bleeding. He is transferred to the
radiology department where the interventional radiologist
inserts a TIPS. This reduces the hepatic venous pressure
gradient from 25 to 8 mmHg and successfully controls the
bleeding. Following insertion of the TIPS he has an episode
of encephalopathy that is managed with lactulose.

If bleeding is controlled after initial
endoscopy, what should be done to
prevent further variceal bleeding?
Following successful endoscopic control of an acute
variceal haemorrhage, patients should enter into an
endoscopic banding programme to eradicate varices.
Repeat endoscopies with banding should be performed
at 1–2-weekly intervals until varices are obliterated. This
takes on average 2–4 settings. Following successful
variceal eradication, patients should be periodically surveyed to ensure varices have not recurred.

How could this emergency admission
have been prevented?
Patients who are known to have cirrhosis should be
screened for the presence of varices by endoscopy.
If varices are identified then non-selective β-blockers

(e.g. propranolol) should be prescribed to reduce
portal pressure. If there are contraindications to
β-blockers or these are not tolerated patients may have
their varices eradicated by prophylactic variceal band
ligation.

CASE REV IE W
This man had a long history of alcohol abuse and presented with vomiting and subsequent haematemesis. He
was resuscitated with fluids and blood and his coagulopathy corrected with fresh frozen plasma and platelets. At
endoscopy he was found to have bleeding oesophageal
varices that were treated with variceal band ligation. This

initially controlled the bleeding but he had a further torrential bleed requiring temporary insertion of a
Sengstaken–Blakemore tube to arrest the bleeding.
Subsequently, a TIPS was inserted that reduced the portal
pressure and controlled the bleeding.

• Variceal bleeding has a high mortality
• Initial management is to secure and protect the airway
and administer volume replacement to stabilise the patient
• Early endoscopy should be performed in patients with
major bleeding to accurately diagnose the cause of the
bleed and to permit therapy to control bleeding
• In suspected variceal haemorrhage, treatment with
vasoactive drugs (e.g. terlipressin or octreotide) should be
started as soon as possible, since a reduction in portal
pressure is associated with a better control of bleeding
and may facilitate endoscopic procedures
• There is a high risk of infection, and antibiotics such as
quinolones or cephalosporins should be given

• Following successful control of bleeding, patients should
enter a programme of regular endoscopy and banding
ligation to eradicate varices
• If endoscopy is unsuccessful, patients may require
emergency measures to control bleeding such as balloon
tamponade prior to undergoing a TIPS procedure
• Patients with cirrhosis should undergo screening
endoscopy to identify those with varices who can be
offered primary prophylaxis with β-blockade or endoscopic
therapy

Case 23 A 58-year-old woman with a
distended abdomen

Mrs Anne Philly is a 58-year-old painter who presents with a
3-week history of abdominal swelling. On clinical
examination she has stigmata of chronic liver disease
(palmar erythema, spider naevi and caput medusae) and
shifting dullness in her abdomen.

PA R T 2 : C A S E S

What are the possible causes?
This woman has signs of decompensated liver disease.
Her abdominal swelling is likely to be caused by ascites
rather than the other causes of a swollen abdomen (e.g.
bowel obstruction, constipation, pregnancy). The causes
of ascites can be divided into a transudate or exudate,
defined by measuring the serum albumin–ascites albumin
gradient (SAAG). A SAAG of greater than 11 g/L signifies
a transudate and less than 11 g/L an exudate. The causes
of ascites are given in Box 23.1.

It occurs due to an imbalance between local vasodilators
and vasoconstrictors resulting in splanchnic arterial
vasodilatation.
• This ‘pooling’ of blood in the splanchnic circulation
results in a relative underfilling of the systemic circulation. The body compensates for this by increasing cardiac
output and activating the rennin–angiotensin system to
increase water and sodium absorption. Although total
body water and sodium is high the amount retained in
the central circulating volume is low and this accentuates
a vicious circle.
• ‘Back pressure’ from portal venous hypertension and
low oncotic pressure (reduced albumin synthesis), characteristic of cirrhosis, also contributes to ascites
formation.
Mrs Philly has a diagnostic ascitic tap which shows an

case of suspected ascites?

albumin of 16 g/L and a polymorphonuclear count of
50 cells/mm3. Her serum albumin is 29 g/L.

• Ultrasound of the liver with Doppler examination of the

hepatic vasculature: This will confirm the presence of
ascites (Fig. 23.1) but will also look for important conditions that can cause ascites, e.g. portal vein thrombosis
and hepatocellular carcinoma.
• Diagnostic ascitic tap: This is mandatory in any patient
with chronic liver disease presenting with new onset of
ascites. Twenty to 30 mL of fluid should be aspirated
using an aseptic technique and fluid sent for analysis
(Box 23.2).

Why do patients with cirrhosis
get ascites?
• The formation of ascites requires the presence of portal

hypertension (Fig. 23.2).
• Accumulation of blood in the splanchnic arteriolar
circulation is an initial event in the evolution of ascites.

and Indra Neil Guha. Published 2011 by Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

138

Is her fluid a transudate or exudate?
The serum–ascites albumin gradient is 13 g/L; therefore
the fluid is a transudate.

How should her ascites be managed?
Bed rest
Bed rest can improve ascites as the upright position can
result in activation of the rennin–angiotensin system,
reduced glomerular filtration rate and sodium
excretion.
Low sodium diet
The aim should be for a daily sodium content of
60–90 mEq. Practically, the advice to patients is not to
add salt to their food and avoid processed foods. A
balance exists between reducing sodium and making
food tasteless so patients eat less and worsen their preexisting malnutrition.

Paracentesis
• In patients intolerant of diuretics (usually because of

hyponatraemia or renal dysfunction) or having persistent
ascites despite adequate diuretics (refractory ascites),
large volume paracentesis may be appropriate.
• Large volume paracentesis (LVP) involves removing
ascitic fluid by drainage. The fluid should be removed
over 6–8 hours and the drain removed to prevent the risk
of infection.
• The removal of ascites can result in shifts of intravascular volume (post-paracentesis syndrome) and the risk
of hepatorenal syndrome. Therefore LVP is performed
with colloid infusion (usually salt-poor albumin) to
maintain intravascular volume.
• The procedure can be performed as a day case.
TIPS and shunt surgery
• A transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt

(TIPS) is a recognised treatment of refractory ascites. It
involves producing a shunt within the liver from the
portal vein to the hepatic vein (see Case 21).
• In head to head studies of TIPS versus LVP there is
equivalence of which modality is superior. However, with
better selection of patients for TIPS and the use of
covered stents it is likely the balance will swing towards
TIPS in the future. The reduced need for paracentesis
with a TIPS is countered by the development of hepatic
encephalopathy in a small but significant minority.
• Shunt surgery is now rarely performed for ascites.

What is the likely explanation for her
presentation now?
Her new symptoms raise the concern that she has developed infection in her ascites (spontaneous bacterial peritonitis). This can present in a number of ways including
fever, abdominal pain, increase in ascites, confusion and
worsening of liver function.

How would you investigate her?
A diagnostic tap of her ascites should be performed and
fluid sent for white cell count and culture. Blood cultures
should be obtained.
A diagnostic tap reveals a polymorphonuclear count of
400 cells/mm3. There are no positive cultures from her
ascites.

How should she be managed?
• Intravenous antibiotics: A raised ascitic polymorpho-

nuclear cell count (>250 cells/mm3) is indicative of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). Ascitic fluid culture
is frequently negative and the diagnosis of infection
should be made on the basis of a raised fluid cell count.
Positive cultures if available are helpful to guide antibiotic choice.
• Intravenous albumin: The development of SBP is
frequently accompanied by deterioration in renal
function, which can lead to the hepatorenal syndrome.
Plasma volume expansion with human albumin
solution (1.5 g/kg on the day of diagnosis and a further
1 g/kg on day 3) has been shown to reduce this risk and
also reduce the mortality rate associated with an episode
of SBP.

A 58-year-old woman presented with abdominal swelling
due to ascites and decompensated liver disease. Diagnostic
ascitic tap confirmed the presence of a transudate and
excluded spontaneous peritoneal bacterial peritonitis. She
initially improved on diuretics but suddenly deteriorated

with an increase in ascites accompanied by fever.
Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis was diagnosed based on
an elevated ascitic white cell count and she was treated with
intravenous antibiotics and albumin infusion. Once she
had recovered she was referred for liver transplantation.

KEY POI NTS
• The presence of ascites is a landmark event in cirrhosis
signifying the transition from compensated cirrhosis to
decompensated cirrhosis
• There are a number of differential diagnoses for ascites
other than chronic liver disease.
• The management of ascites is a combination of diet,
diuretics and paracentesis
• In more severe cases, radiological and surgical intervention
may be required

• A diagnostic ascitic tap is mandatory to exclude
spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in acute deterioration
• The development of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis has
prognostic significance. Further recurrence is likely and
therefore prophylactic antibiotics should be initiated
• Diuretic resistant ascites or the development of
spontaneous bacterial peritonitis should prompt
consideration for liver transplantation

A 67-year-old man with known alcoholic liver disease is

with a variceal bleed and ascites. Following that he cut
down his alcohol intake considerably but was still consuming

problem with variceal haemorrhage and his ascites was
managed with a combination of spironolactone and
furosemide. A week prior to his admission he had fallen at
home, fracturing his right humerus and two ribs. He has
been taking regular analgesia following the fall.
On examination he is disorientated and confused. He has
palmar erythema and a few spider naevi. There is extensive
bruising over his arm, neck and chest wall. His liver is not
palpable but his spleen can be felt 3 cm below the costal
margin and there is a moderate amount of ascites. Rectal
examination reveals hard dark stools.

What other causes should
be considered?
Encephalopathy is the most likely diagnosis but patients
should be carefully evaluated for other causes of confusion, for example:
• Brain haemorrhage (in a patient with a history of
excess alcohol intake and recent fall the possibility of an
intracranial bleed, particularly a subdural haematoma,
should be considered).
• Hypoxic/ischaemic brain injury.
• Infection (especially meningitis or encephalitis).
• Neoplasm of the brain.
• Drug overdose, alcohol intoxification and alcohol
withdrawal.
• Metabolic disturbance (e.g. hypoglycaemia, electrolyte
disorder).
• Endocrine disorder (e.g. adrenal, thyroid disorder).

Hepatic encephalopathy is the term given for the neuropsychiatric disturbance observed in patients with liver
dysfunction. It occurs in both acute liver failure and also
in patients with cirrhosis. The condition is usually reversible although chronic encephalopathy may be associated
with irreversible brain damage. Several factors are
thought to play a part in the development of hepatic
encephalopathy (Box 24.1).

What are the clinical features?
Hepatic encephalopathy can take many forms and any
change in mental status in a patient with known or suspected liver dysfunction should be considered to be due
to hepatic encephalopathy until proven otherwise.
Common disturbances seen include:
• Disturbed consciousness (excessive sleepiness, reversal
of the normal day/night sleep pattern, reduced responsiveness progressing to coma).
• Confusion and disorientation (varies from minor
impairment to gross confusion).

Case 24 143

• Impaired liver function results in a reduction in first-pass
metabolism of ‘toxins’ that reach the liver in portal
venous blood
• Portal blood rich in nitrogenous substances bypasses the
cirrhotic liver via portosystemic collaterals and reaches
the brain
• An increase in ‘toxin’ levels in the systemic circulation
(e.g. due to infection) increase the likelihood of hepatic
encephalopathy

• Disturbance of personality and mood.
• Flapping tremor (asterixis) may be present.
• Hepatic fetor.

These features may fluctuate and the patient can be
completely well in between episodes.

How is encephalopathy managed?
What precipitating factors could be
relevant in the case described?
• Constipation: Rectal examination in this patient

revealed hard stools. Prolonged colonic transit time
increases the toxin load in the portal venous system and
can precipitate or exacerbate encephalopathy.
• Gastrointestinal haemorrhage: This patient has a
history of previous variceal bleeding. At presentation he
is anaemic with raised urea and dark stools on rectal
examination, suggesting possible gastrointestinal haemorrhage. Blood produces a large protein load in the gastrointestinal tract and absorption of this into the portal
venous system can induce encephalopathy.
• Analgesic medication: Opiate-containing medications
may precipitate encephalopathy either by direct effects
on the brain or as a consequence of their constipating
effect.
• Dehydration and electrolyte disturbance: Cirrhotic
patients are frequently intravascularly depleted; in addition, this patient is on diuretics putting him at further
risk of dehydration. His sodium and potassium are low,
both of which can contribute to encephalopathy.
• Infection: Infection is a common precipitant of
encephalopathy and should always be considered and
actively sought. This man’s CRP is raised which could
indicate an underlying infection.
Other precipitating factors for hepatic encephalopathy
are given in Box 24.2.

Acute encephalopathy
• If the patient is in a coma, supportive measures should
be instigated (e.g. airway protection, fluid balance, nutrition support).
• Identify and remove any possible precipitant (correct
electrolyte disturbances, stop drugs especially opiates,
benzodiazepines and diuretics).
• Actively seek and treat any infection.
• Empty the bowel of nitrogenous substances using laxatives (e.g. lactulose) and enemas. If there is gastrointestinal haemorrhage this must be treated promptly.
Restricting protein in the diet is no longer recommended as patients with liver disease severe enough to
cause encephalopathy are frequently malnourished and
in a state of protein catabolism. These patients actually
benefit from high protein feeding.
Chronic encephalopathy
• Avoid precipitating factors (constipation, narcotic

drugs, over-diuresis).
• Give lactulose 10–30 mL up to three times a day.
• Chronic encephalopathy may be an indication for liver

transplantation.
A septic screen is performed and does not demonstrate any
evidence of infection. At gastroscopy he is found to have
altered blood in the stomach, severe oesophagitis and an
erosive gastritis. He is treated with a proton pump inhibitor,

his diuretics are stopped and he is given intravenous fluids
and electrolyte replacement. Lactulose and phosphate
enemas are given to good effect and his condition begins to
improve. Thirty-six hours after his admission he becomes
more confused and restless. On examination he is sweaty,
tremulous and has a tachycardia of 120 beats per minute.

What do you think has happened?
His clinical condition now most likely reflects the alcohol
withdrawal syndrome (Box 24.3). Alternative explanations should be considered including sepsis, gastrointestinal haemorrhage, head injury or metabolic disturbance
such as hypoglycaemia.

PA R T 2 : C A S E S

How would you manage him now?

Box 24.3 Features of the alcohol withdrawal
syndrome
This is a clinical syndrome that usually commences 1–4
days after cessation of chronic alcohol intake. Features
include:
• Neurological hyperexcitability:
䊊 agitation
䊊 anxiety
䊊 tremor
䊊 seizures
䊊 confusion
䊊 hallucinations (usually visual)
• Autonomic instability:
䊊 sweating
䊊 diarrhoea
䊊 tachycardia

Managing the alcohol withdrawal syndrome is challenging in any patient but particularly so in one who is at risk
of hepatic encephalopathy. The first priority is the safety
of the patient and those around them. Patients can sometimes become aggressive and dangerous or may develop
uncontrollable seizures; in these situations it may be necessary to sedate and ventilate the patient.
In milder cases, benzodiazepines such as chlordiazepoxide should be given. Small doses of an antipsychotic agent such as haloperidol may be required if there
is marked confusion with hallucinations. In many cases,
a reducing regimen of chlordiazepoxide is prescribed that
tapers the dose over a 5–7-day course. Great care must
be given in prescribing such a regimen in a liver patient
as they are more susceptible to the sedative effects of
these drugs. The prescription should be reviewed daily
and adjusted according to the patient’s clinical
condition.
Patients should also be given intravenous B vitamins
to protect against developing Wernicke-Korsakoff
syndrome.

KEY POINT
• Patients with liver disease are very sensitive to sedative
drugs. Prescribe as small an amount as possible, review
the patient frequently, and adjust the dose according to
the clinical effect

He is started on a reducing course of chlordiazepoxide
which improves his confusion and irritability. This is
discontinued after 5 days; he is much improved without any
evidence of confusion and is discharged home.

CA SE REV IE W
This patient with known cirrhosis presented to hospital
with a history of confusion. The most likely cause was
hepatic encephalopathy. There were several possible precipitants including dehydration, uraemia, electrolyte disturbance and gastrointestinal haemorrhage. His fluid
balance and electrolyte disturbance were corrected and

he was treated with lactulose and phosphate enemas
with initial improvement of his symptoms. He subsequently deteriorated due to development of the alcohol
withdrawal syndrome. He was carefully treated with a
tapering course of chlordiazepoxide with resolution of his
confusion.

encouraging bowel emptying with lactulose and

What are the possible causes for her
bleeding varices?
Varices signify the presence of portal hypertension. The
causes can be divided into the anatomical site of
obstruction/increased resistance in the hepatic vasculature. These are:

How are bleeding gastric varices
managed?
Bleeding from gastric varices is less common than
oesophageal variceal bleeding but is more challenging to
treat and is associated with a high mortality rate. The
varices are generally large with a high volume of blood
flowing through them. Band ligation or sclerotherapy
with ethanolamine are not generally recommended as
they are associated with a high incidence of rebleeding.
Recently some centres have demonstrated success in controlling bleeding with an injection of cyanoacrylate
(‘superglue’) directly into the varices. If bleeding cannot
be controlled endoscopically, then the patient may
require balloon tamponade for initial stabilisation (see
Case 21) and then consideration for TIPS or rarely shunt
surgery.
Mrs Winter undergoes a liver ultrasound with Doppler
examination which reveals a portal vein thrombosis. The liver
echotexture looks normal and the spleen is enlarged. A CT
scan of the liver confirms portal vein thrombosis. There is
evidence of collateralisation at the porta hepatitis (cavernous
transformation) suggesting that the portal vein thrombosis is

does not preclude the diagnosis of cirrhosis; as mentioned in other sections liver function tests can be entirely
normal in cirrhosis. Against the diagnosis of cirrhosis is
the fact that the portal hypertension is out of keeping to
her synthetic function (normal albumin, clotting and
bilirubin). To be certain that she does not have cirrhosis
a liver biopsy should be considered.
A liver biopsy is performed and confirms normal hepatic
architecture without evidence of cirrhosis.

What are the possible explanations for
her portal vein thrombosis?
The main causes of portal vein thrombosis are as follows:
• Liver cirrhosis.
• Intra-abdominal sepsis (e.g. diverticular disease or

appendicitis).
• Abdominal trauma or surgery.
• Pancreatitis (may start as splenic vein thrombosis).
• Neonatal umbilical vein occlusion, e.g. by catheterisa-

tion or sepsis.
• Myeloproliferative disorders.
• Hypercoagulable disorders.
• Malignancy (HCC and pancreatic carcinoma).

• Congenital causes.
• Idiopathic causes.

What are the features of portal
vein thrombosis?
• It can present acutely with right upper quadrant pain

and fever but often the precipitant (e.g. appendicitis) will
dictate the presenting symptoms.
• If there is mesenteric ischaemia due to complete occlusion this may result in an ischaemic bowel (abdominal
pain, bleeding, lactic acidosis).
• Progression from the acute to the chronic phase leads
to the formation of collateral vessels and classic cavernous transformation (recruitment of minor vessels that
run adjacent to the portal vein and serve as a conduit of
blood in obstruction).
• In the absence of underlying liver cirrhosis, portal vein
thrombosis may not present with many symptoms until
many years later; there is a buffering response with
increased blood flow in the hepatic artery. The commonest presentation is with varices.
• In cirrhosis, a superimposed portal vein thrombosis
can lead to decompensation with encephalopathy, bleeding, jaundice or ascites.

• Diagnosis is usually by radiological imaging (Doppler

Treatment of portal vein thrombosis
• If the portal vein thrombosis is acute then aggressive

attempts to recanalise the portal vein may be undertaken.
This includes the use of intravenous heparin, thrombolysis and thrombectomy.
• The use of anticoagulation in the chronic setting
depends on the underlying cause of the portal vein
thrombosis. If there is an underlying procoagulant tendency (Box 25.1) then long-term anticoagulation is
advisable after eradication of the varices. In the absence

of a proven prothrombotic tendency some authorities
would still recommend anticoagulation.
• TIPS is more technically challenging in the context of
portal thrombosis but in expert hands the combination
of either aspiration or mechanical fragmentation of the
clot can be considered, followed by angioplasty before
deploying a stent.
• Shunt surgery is being utilised less frequently but is
considered if endoscopic therapy and radiological intervention fail to control bleeding or the subsequent complications of portal vein thrombosis.
• Portal vein thrombosis can complicate future orthotopic liver transplantation and until recently was a relative contraindication. However, by using thrombectomy,
jump grafts and portal vein tributaries, there are now
options for dealing with portal vein thrombosis at the
time of transplantation.

Mrs Winter is investigated for the cause of her portal vein
thrombosis. There is no history of abdominal surgery,
trauma or sepsis. A thrombophilia screen is requested and
shows that she has protein C deficiency. Her gastric varices
are eradicated by three courses of direct cyanoacrylate
injection after which she is commenced on long-term
anticoagulation. She continues to be seen regularly in
outpatients and has no further complications.

Case 26 A 37-year-old woman with abnormal
liver ultrasound

Joanna Dunlop is a 37-year-old woman who is being
investigated for left-sided loin pain. Her general practitioner
refers her for a renal ultrasound examination which
demonstrates a 7 mm calculus in the left renal pelvis. Whilst
undertaking the scan the radiographer also notices an 8 cm
focal lesion in her liver. She comes back to her GP to discuss

PA R T 2 : C A S E S

the results of the scan.

What is likely to be the main concern of
the patient?
She is most likely concerned that the lesion seen in her
liver is cancer.

What would you tell her?
It is important to tell her that incidental lesions in the
liver are very common and are usually benign. She will,
however, require further investigation to ascertain the
exact nature of the lesion and whether any treatment is
required.

What are the causes of a focal lesion in
the liver?
There are many causes of a focal abnormality within the
liver. Lesions can be classified as benign or malignant.
Malignant lesions may be primary (arising from liver
tissue) or secondary (spread to the liver from another
site, e.g. bowel, breast, lung, etc.). A list of primary malignant lesions is given in Table 26.1. Hepatocellular carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma are the most common
primary malignant lesions and are discussed in Cases 13
and 18. There are many benign causes for a focal lesion
in the liver. The most important benign lesions are listed
in Table 26.2.

What questions would you ask
the patient?
• Is there a history of pain? Liver lesions do not often
cause pain and in fact lesions as large as 10–15 cm are
often asymptomatic. If they do cause pain it may be due
to stretch of the liver capsule or to sudden haemorrhage
of the lesion.
• Is there any risk factor to suggest she might have an
underlying liver disorder? The common malignant
lesions, hepatocellular carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma, frequently develop on a background of cirrhosis
or chronic biliary tract disease.
• Is there any history of a multisystem disorder? Any other
past medical history? Some benign liver lesions are associated with multisystem disorders.
• Is there any history of malignancy outside the liver? This
may suggest a secondary deposit in the liver.
• Does she take any regular medication? Some liver
lesions are associated with hormonal preparations, e.g.
anabolic steroids or the oral contraceptive pill.
• Is there any family history? Some conditions such as
polycystic liver disease are familial.
• Has there been any trauma to the abdomen? Previous
trauma with haemorrhage can sometimes result in areas
of calcification in the liver.

What would you do next?
Her images need to be reviewed by an experienced radiologist. This is usually achieved by referring her case to
the local hepatobiliary multidisciplinary team. Such
teams usually include radiologists, pathologists, physicians, surgeons and oncologists who meet together regularly to discuss cases and decide upon appropriate
investigation and treatment pathways.
She should be seen in the hepatology clinic and
assessed for risk factors for liver disease, a clinical
examination performed and liver function tests
measured.

What do you think has happened?
Knowing that she has a large, solid, focal lesion in her
liver it is possible that she has bled into this causing her
sudden pain and fall in blood pressure. There is, however,
a wide differential diagnosis for these symptoms and
other causes such as pancreatitis, visceral perforation and
gynaecological causes, amongst others, should also be
considered.

How would you manage her?
The first priority is rapid assessment and resuscitation to
ensure that she is haemodynamically stable. Once this has
been achieved she should have emergency imaging of her
abdomen to investigate her symptoms.

diverticulitis and new onset of pain make an intraabdominal source of infection likely but other causes
must always be considered. He has recently been in hospital and could have a hospital-acquired infection such
as chest or urinary tract infection.
• Abdominal imaging (e.g. ultrasound or CT scan): His
recent history of diverticulitis and these new symptoms
suggest an intra-abdominal source of infection.

• Constitutional symptoms (malaise, anorexia, nausea,

vomiting, weight loss).
• Diaphragmatic irritation (right shoulder tip pain, res-

piratory symptoms).
• Jaundice is uncommon and generally a late finding

unless the abscess is causing biliary obstruction.

How can organisms get into the liver?
• Portal venous circulation (as a complication of intra-

abdominal infections, e.g. appendicitis, diverticulitis,
peritonitis or postoperative infections).
• Biliary tree (as a complication of cholangitis).
• Hepatic artery (as a complication of systemic bacteraemia; metastatic abscesses may be present at a number
of sites within the body).
• Percutaneous (as a complication of a penetrating
wound or an iatrogenic complication, e.g. following liver
biopsy).

large intrahepatic abscess in this patient.

What bacteria cause hepatic abscesses?
Liver abscesses are frequently polymicrobial. Many of the
causative organisms originate in the gastrointestinal tract
hence enteric Gram-negative bacilli (aerobes and anaerobes) are frequently isolated:
• Escherichia coli
• Klebsiella pneumonia
• Enterococcus spp
• Bacteroides spp
• Streptococcus spp (milleri group and anaerobic species)
• Proteus spp
• Pseudomonas spp
• Fusobacterium spp.
If the infection does not originate in the gastrointestinal
tract, possible organisms include:
• Staphylococcus spp
• Streptococcus spp.

What other organisms can cause
liver abscesses?
• Fungi: Fungal abscesses are rare in immunocompetent

individuals but can be seen in hepatic ischaemia or in the
immunocompromised host. They are associated with a
particularly poor prognosis.
• Parasites: Invasion of the liver by roundworms or
flukes can be associated with biliary infection leading to
pyogenic liver abscesses.
• Amoeba: The amoeba Entamoeba histolytica can also
lead to hepatic abscesses. Cysts in contaminated food or
water are ingested and release invasive trophozoites in

the small intestine. These reach the colon where they
invade the colonic mucosa causing amoebic dysentery. In
some cases the trophozoites are carried via the portal
circulation to the liver, resulting in the formation of
abscesses. Clinical features and imaging findings are
similar to those of bacterial abscesses. History of travel to
an endemic area (e.g. India, sub-Saharan Africa or South
America) may suggest the diagnosis.

What is the treatment?
Antibiotics
Antibiotics are the mainstay of treatment and should be
started as soon as the diagnosis is suspected. Empirical
treatment is usually given to cover enteric bacteria,
including anaerobic cover (e.g. a combination of ampicillin, gentamicin and metronidazole). Microbiology
advice should be sought to ascertain the local prevalence
of resistant strains, particularly of Enterobacteria, and
alternative antibiotics such as third generation cephalosporins or ampicillin/clavulonic acid or piperacillin/
tazobactam combinations in place of ampicillin may be
considered. Subsequent antibiotic therapy should be
adjusted according to the results of bacterial cultures and
sensitivity reports. Prolonged courses of antibiotics (2–6
weeks) are frequently required.
Drainage
Most abscesses will require drainage in addition to antibiotic therapy. Drainage can usually be achieved by
an ultrasound or CT-guided approach, although occa-

Case 27 157

What is the prognosis?
Untreated, hepatic abscesses have a very poor prognosis
with near 100% mortality. The combination of needle
aspiration and antibiotic therapy has reduced mortality
to 10–25%. Poor prognosis is associated with multiple
liver abscesses, old age, coexisting medical conditions
and jaundice.
The liver abscess is drained under ultrasound guidance
revealing thick purulent fluid which grows Escherichia coli.
Mr Brown is started on intravenous ampicillin, gentamicin
and metronidazole therapy, which results in improvement in
his inflammatory markers. He has a repeat ultrasound after
2 weeks of therapy that demonstrates that the abscess
cavity is significantly reduced in size. He is due to be
changed to oral antibiotics and discharged home but he
suddenly develops watery diarrhoea with his bowels opening
six times a day.

What is the most likely cause of his
diarrhoea?
The most probable cause is antibiotic-associated
diarrhoea.

What other causes of diarrhoea should
be considered?
• Diverticular disease: His initial problem was caused by

diverticulitis. The return of diarrhoea could herald an
exacerbation of this chronic condition.
• Colorectal neoplasm: Colorectal cancer with metastatic
disease should be considered as an underlying cause in
any case presenting with liver abscesses.

What is the mechanism of antibioticassociated diarrhoea?
Antibiotics disturb the balance of the normal gastrointestinal bacteria and can lead to a proliferation of harmful
bacteria that can produce diarrhoea. This is a common
side effect of antibiotic therapy and often resolves as soon

as the antibiotics are discontinued and the normal microbial species are re-established.
The most serious form of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea is overpopulation with the anaerobic, Grampositive, spore-forming bacillus Clostridium difficile. This
bacterium is present in the hospital environment where
it can persist in spore form. Infection is spread by the
faecal–oral route. Overgrowth of C. difficile in the gastrointestinal tract and release of toxins A and B results in
diarrhoea, bloating and in its most severe form inflammation and ulceration of the colonic mucosa with the
development of pseudomembranes (pseudomembranous colitis).

How is C. difficile-associated diarrhoea
diagnosed?
Diagnosis is made by detecting the bacterial toxin in the
stool of a symptomatic patient. Detecting the presence of
the bacteria alone is not sufficient to diagnose C. difficileassociated diarrhoea since it is a normal commensal
organism in the bowel in many individuals.

How do you treat C. difficile-associated
diarrhoea?
Metronidazole or vancomycin are the main antibiotics
used to treat C. difficile diarrhoea. Metronidazole is the
drug of choice as it is less expensive and has comparable
efficacy with vancomycin. Treatment course is usually for
10–14 days although some patients relapse when treatment is discontinued.

Why did he develop C. difficile
diarrhoea if he was already on
metronidazole?
• Some

strains of C. difficile are resistant to
metronidazole.
• He was on intravenous metronidazole which does not
give high concentrations of antibiotic in the gut lumen
where the bacteria are located.

KEY POINT
• Treatment for C. difficile diarrhoea should be with oral
antibiotics to ensure that the drug gets to the site of
infection

PA R T 2 : C A S E S

sionally formal surgical drainage is required. Simple aspiration of the abscess may be sufficient but frequently it
is necessary to insert a drainage tube, which may need to
remain in place for several days or weeks. If there are
multiple abscesses, drainage of all the abscesses may not
be practical and some cases are managed with antibiotics
alone.

158

Part 2: Cases

What other precautions should be
undertaken in managing patients with
C. difficile diarrhoea?
Patients should be nursed in isolation in a side room with
its own toilet facilities to minimise the spread of infection
to other patients. Staff and visitors should wear
gloves and aprons when interacting with the patient and
wash their hands with soap and water after each
encounter.

performed which is normal, but CT examination of the
abdomen demonstrates several lesions within the liver
(Fig. 28.1).

What is the likely diagnosis?
The symptoms of diarrhoea with facial flushing in a
patient with multiple liver lesions strongly suggest the
carcinoid syndrome.

What is the primary tumour? Where
does it arise?

What is the cause of his current
symptoms?
Carcinoid tumours produce a number of hormones
including serotonin, also known as 5-hydroxytryptamine
(5-HT). If 5-HT reaches the systemic circulation it can
produce the symptoms of flushing, bronchospasm and
diarrhoea. Primary gut carcinoid tumours secrete 5-HT
into the portal circulation; it passes to the liver and is
inactivated there. Thus, the carcinoid syndrome is not
present when tumours are confined to the gastrointestinal primary site. In the presence of liver metastases, 5-HT
is secreted directly into the systemic circulation and the
patient may develop symptoms.

Carcinoid tumours are neoplasms arising from the neuroendocrine system. Most primary tumours arise from
the gastrointestinal tract and may be classified depending
on their point of origin as foregut (stomach and duodenum), midgut (ileum and proximal colon) or hindgut
(distal colon and rectum). Midgut tumours are the most
common; they are frequently asymptomatic but may
present as bowel obstruction or as an incidental finding
following appendicectomy for acute appendicitis. Other
rare sites of origin of carcinoid tumours include the lungs
and thymus gland.

controlling symptoms of the carcinoid syndrome,
particularly flushing and diarrhoea. The disadvantage is
that it has to be given subcutaneously and has a short
half-life so has to be given multiple times a day. Slow
release formulations are now available.
• Cytotoxic chemotherapy: Most agents produce disappointing results and this treatment should only be
considered as a last resort when embolisation and pharmacological treatment have failed.

the carcinoid

If the primary site is unknown what test
could help to identify it?
The primary site is often not visible on CT or MRI
imaging. An octreotide scan may help in localising the
primary tumour. Carcinoid tumour cells frequently have
receptors for somatostatin. Octreotide is a synthetic
somatostatin analogue. Radioactive indium-111-labelled
octreotide given to the patient can bind to the somatostatin receptors on the carcinoid tumour and appear as
bright areas on an octreotide scan. This test is used in the
detection of liver metastases and localisation of the
primary tumour.

This man had an appendicectomy at which time an
appendiceal tumour was resected. He was unable to
recall the details but his presentation several years later
with flushing, diarrhoea and wheeze strongly suggested
metastatic neuroendocrine tumour with the carcinoid
syndrome. His liver contained many secondary deposits
such that curative surgery was not possible. His symptoms were controlled with the somatostatin analogue,
octreotide, and the tumour mass was reduced by hepatic
embolisation.

KEY POINTS

What options are available for
treatment?
• Surgery: If complete surgical resection is possible then

the patient could be considered for this radical approach.
Frequently, however, the metastases are too extensive for
this to be feasible. Liver transplantation has been performed in carefully selected patients.
• Hepatic embolisation: Liver metastases are highly vascular and respond well to radiological embolisation of
their blood supply. A catheter is inserted into the femoral
artery and under fluoroscopic guidance is passed into the
hepatic artery where the tumour vessels can be identified
and blocked. Some patients require multiple embolisations over many years to control symptoms.

• Carcinoid tumours are rare neoplasms of the
neuroendocrine system, most frequently originating in
the midgut
• The primary tumours progress slowly and are frequently
asymptomatic for many years
• Development of the carcinoid syndrome implies
metastatic spread to the liver and secretion of 5-HT into
the systemic circulation
• An elevated 24-hour urine 5-HIAA is suggestive of the
carcinoid syndrome
• Treatment options for symptoms of the carcinoid
syndrome include surgical resection or embolisation of
hepatic lesions or octreotide pharmacotherapy

What is the most likely diagnosis?
Metastatic colorectal carcinoma.

What other investigations should be
performed?
• It is important to investigate whether the cancer has

What investigations may be undertaken
to confirm the diagnosis?
A patient with typical appearances of liver metastases and
a recent history of colorectal carcinoma may not require
any further investigation. Benign lesions of the liver are,
however, common and if there is any doubt as to the
nature of a liver lesion then further investigation will be
required:
• Many colorectal carcinomas produce the tumour
marker carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). It is not
specific for the disorder but can be helpful in detecting
recurrence in patients where elevated CEA levels return
to normal after treatment of the primary tumour.
• Positron emission tomography (PET) scanning may be
helpful in demonstrating recurrence and in determining
whether a lesion in the liver is malignant or not.

spread anywhere else. If a whole body PET scan has not
been undertaken it is important to image the chest,
usually with a CT scan.
• A colonoscopy should be performed if he has not had
one in the last year to exclude a second colorectal primary
tumour.

What treatment options are available?
• Surgical resection of liver metastases: Liver resection

may be curative, although patients are frequently not fit
enough for this complex procedure and the number,
location and size of the metastases may mean that resection is not technically possible. The average 5-year survival following liver resection for colorectal metastases is
25–30%; the outlook is better if there is a solitary lesion.
• Radiofrequency ablation (RFA): RFA uses heat to
destroy cancer cells in the liver. It involves placing electrodes into the tumour under ultrasound guidance. The
electrodes are used to heat the tumour with the aim of
destroying it. RFA can be applied percutaneously or
during surgery.

• Chemotherapy: Chemotherapy may be used as an

adjunct to surgical or radiological approaches or may be
used alone, when its use would be considered to prolong
life rather than aiming to cure the disease.
Mr Jones undergoes a colonoscopy which is normal and a
PET scan which shows no evidence of disease outside of the
liver. His CEA is elevated, having been normal 6 months
previously. His images are reviewed by radiologists and
hepatobiliary surgeons and it is felt that he is a candidate
for surgical resection.

What factors need to be considered
when contemplating hepatic resection?
• Fitness for the operation: Liver resection is a major pro-

cedure with an operative mortality of 3–8%. An anaesthetic assessment is essential to determine the patient’s
fitness for the procedure. Recently, laparoscopic liver
resections have been performed that may reduce morbidity and mortality.
• Number and location of tumour deposits: The location
of the tumour deposits is a key determinant of whether
surgical resection is technically feasible. Detailed radiological assessment is necessary to determine the precise
location of the tumour deposits and their relationships
to the hepatic vasculature. Deposits confined to one lobe
may be removed by a lobectomy. If there is bilobar
disease it is frequently not possible to undertake a curative resection although it may sometimes be possible
to perform a lobectomy and also perform small wedge
excisions of peripheral deposits in the other lobe.

ability to regenerate and it is this phenomenon that
makes major liver surgery possible. It is important,
however, to ensure that sufficient tissue remains to
provide essential hepatic functions whilst the liver is
undertaking this period of regeneration. Generally resection of 50% of the liver is well tolerated without major
morbidity, and in a carefully selected cases resection of
60–70% of the liver may be tolerated.
• State of the background liver: The ability of the liver to
regenerate is determined by the state of the background
hepatic tissue. The factors that impair liver regeneration
are given in Box 29.1. If any of these factors are present
patients are less able to tolerate major hepatic resection.
• Extrahepatic disease: Whether there is extrahepatic
metastatic disease needs to be determined by CT or PET
examination. The presence of such disease is not necessarily a contraindication to undertaking hepatic resection
since radiological approaches for treating metastatic
deposits and even lung surgery can be undertaken in
carefully selected cases.

What are the complications of hepatic
resection?
• Bleeding: During liver surgery several major vascular

structures are divided and can cause bleeding. In addition, the liver is a highly vascular organ and bleeding
from the cut edge of the remnant liver may occur.
• Infection: Any surgical procedure can predispose to
infection (e.g. wound, urinary tract, pneumonia). If there
is hepatic dysfunction the ability to prevent and respond
to infection is impaired, resulting in an increased risk and
increased severity of clinical infective episodes.
• Hepatic failure: Insufficient liver mass to undertake
essential hepatic functions leads to liver failure. This may
be manifest by coagulopathy, infection, renal dysfunction and encephalopathy and may result in death.

Case 29 163

• Bile leak: Leakage of bile from the cut surface of the

• Other surgical complications: He is at risk of other sur-

liver or the divided bile ducts can occur. Bile is a chemical
irritant and leakage into the abdomen causes pain and
inflammation and acts as a nidus for infection.
• Fluid collections: Following liver surgery, fluid may
collect in the abdomen as ascites or discrete collections,
e.g. in the subphrenic space. Such collections may
become infected, requiring radiological or surgical drainage. In addition, surgery close to the diaphragm can
result in pleural irritation with the development of a
pleural effusion.

gical complications including thromboembolic disease,
wound leaks and pulmonary atelectasis.
Mr Jones is reviewed by an anaesthetist and is felt to be fit
for liver surgery. He undergoes a right hemihepatectomy
and makes an uncomplicated postoperative recovery.
Histology of the resected specimen confirms metastatic
adenocarcinoma.

Mr Jones had a history of colorectal primary cancer which
had been treated with surgical resection and chemotherapy. Two years later he was found to have a palpable liver
and CT examination demonstrated a solitary lesion in the

right lobe of the liver consistent with a metastatic deposit.
He underwent a liver resection which he tolerated well and
was discharged home.

Case 30 A 56-year-old man with abnormal liver
function tests 4 weeks after liver
transplantation

Martin Young is a 56-year-old man who underwent liver
transplantation. He was discharged home 3 weeks after his
transplant with normal liver function tests. At his outpatient
visit a week later he is feeling well but his liver function tests

are noted to be abnormal:
Bilirubin
ALT
ALP
CRP

42 μmol/L
279 iU/L
163 iU/L
68 mg/L

What questions would you ask him?
• What was the indication for liver transplantation? The

indication for liver transplantation may have a bearing
on the risk of certain complications following transplantation. For example, patients with autoimmune disease
may be more likely to get rejection; those with a biliary
aetiology may be more likely to get a biliary complication. Indications for liver transplantation are given in
Box 30.1 and contraindications in Box 30.2.
• Has he had a fever? A fever might suggest infection.
Further questions should be asked, for example does he
have respiratory or urinary symptoms, redness or discharge from his wound?
• Is there any pain? It is common to have some pain
following a transplant but it should be improving by
week 4 and controlled by simple analgesia.
• Any other symptoms (e.g. nausea, vomiting, bowel
disturbance)?
• What medication is he taking?

What other information
might be helpful?
• Operation details: The operation note should be examined as there may be special surgical considerations that

and Indra Neil Guha. Published 2011 by Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

164

need to be taken into account in his presentation. The
patient himself is unlikely to be aware of these details.
• Postoperative course: Again, the patient himself may
not be aware of the details of any early postoperative
issues, therefore the notes should be examined
carefully.
Mr Young had his transplant for cirrhosis secondary to
hepatitic C. The operation itself was relatively
straightforward. Three days following the operation he was
diagnosed with a postoperative chest infection that
responded well to antibiotics. Otherwise his postoperative
course was uncomplicated and he was discharged home on
three immunosuppressive drugs, tacrolimus, azathioprine
and prednisolone. Since he has been home he has felt well
in himself, he has not had a fever and his pain has been
manageable on paracetamol and occasional opiate
analgesia. On examination he looks well but is mildly
jaundiced. His temperature is 37.8°C. His heart sounds are
normal and his chest is clear. His abdominal wound appears
to be healing well and is only slightly tender. There is no
organomegaly and no free fluid evident in his abdomen.

What complications should be
considered in this early
post-transplant period?
• Infection: Post-transplant infection is common with

bacterial infection predominating (Box 30.3). CMV is a
particular risk if a CMV-positive donor is used for a
CMV-negative recipient. Other viral infections are rarely
a problem. Local fungal infections are common and can
be treated with topical therapy. Systemic fungal infection
is fortunately rare, usually occurring in hospitalised
patients who are already ill.
• Rejection.
• Surgical complications (Box 30.4).
• Recurrent disease: This rarely causes a problem in the
first few weeks but is a significant concern in the long
term.

What types of rejection do you know?
• Hyperacute rejection: This occurs immediately due to
preformed antibodies, e.g. ABO incompatibility. Patients
undergoing liver transplantation are matched for blood
group and this form of rejection is not seen.
• Acute cellular rejection: This is common, probably
occurring in over 50% of transplants although not all
episodes are symptomatic. It occurs early in the first few
weeks post-transplantation due to T-cell recognition of
HLA mismatches. It is characterised by deterioration in
liver blood tests and may be accompanied by a fever.

Mild episodes may settle spontaneously although more
severe episodes will require treatment with high doses of
corticosteroids.
• Chronic ductopenic rejection: This is less common,
affecting 3–7% of transplants. It occurs later with a peak
onset at 3 months. The presentation is with jaundice,
itching, elevated alkaline phosphatase and histology
showing a paucity of bile ducts within portal tracts. No
medical treatment is of proven benefit and patients may
require a second transplant.
Mr Young receives high dose immunosuppression with three

toms or signs of infection. They should be reminded to
have vaccinations for influenza each year.
• Vascular disease: Immunosuppressant drugs are complicated by diabetes, hypertension and weight gain,
which increase the risk of vascular disease. Patients
should be assessed for this risk and treated accordingly.
• Renal impairment: Tacrolimus, and the other
commonly used primary immunosuppressant drug
ciclosporin, are nephrotoxic and renal impairment is
common with long-term use.
• Malignancy: Immunosuppression increases the risk of
malignancy. Patients should be advised to wear sun
cream and should have appropriate screening, e.g. cervical smears. Transplantation can be complicated by lymphoproliferation when it is known as post-transplant
lymphoproliferative disorder.
Disease recurrence
One of the greatest threats to long-term graft outlook is
disease recurrence, especially viral hepatitis, but also
autoimmune disease, fatty liver disease and use of alcohol.

1. e: The history of recurrent post-prandial right
upper quadrant pain is very suggestive of
gallstones. The most likely diagnosis is therefore
gallstone obstruction of the common bile duct
resulting in jaundice. In suspected biliary
obstruction the most appropriate radiological test is
an abdominal ultrasound to look for biliary duct
dilatation. Carcinoma of the head of the pancreas
typically causes painless jaundice and would be
uncommon in this age group. In gallstone disease,
chronic inflammation usually results in a shrunken
fibrotic gallbladder; gallbladder distension is more
likely in obstructive jaundice not due to stones.
Urobilinogen is colourless; dark urine occurs due
to excess conjugated bilirubin passing into the
urine. In biliary obstruction there is impaired
absorption of the fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E and
K. The absence of vitamin K reduces hepatic
production of clotting factors resulting in
prolongation of the prothrombin time.
2. d: Many infants develop transient jaundice after
birth due to the immaturity of the bilirubin
conjugating system. It develops on the second day
and persists for 2–3 weeks. It is more common in
breast fed babies. The colour of the urine and stool
are normal. Biliary atresia causes biliary
obstruction, the urine turns dark and the stools are
pale. Babies with neonatal CMV infection are often
unwell and failing to thrive and may have
congenital abnormalities. Crigler–Najjar syndrome
causes severe hyperbilirubinaemia and untreated
can lead to the neurological syndrome of
kernicterus. Hypothyroidism is rare but should be
excluded if the jaundice persists beyond 3 weeks.

3. c: After assessing that he has a safe airway, the first
priority of management is fluid resuscitation. He
should be given intravenous fluids, including blood
and clotting products if appropriate, prior to
undergoing endoscopy. The management of
variceal haemorrhage has improved considerably in
the past decade and his risk of dying on this
admission to hospital is 15–20%. There is evidence
that early administration of broad spectrum
antibiotics results in a reduction in infection rates,
reduced re-bleeding and an improved mortality.
Terlipressin causes vasoconstriction of the
splanchnic circulation, reducing flow and pressure
in the portal venous system. The best endoscopic
treatment is variceal band ligation. If endoscopic
injection is required then a sclerosant agent such as
ethanolamine is used rather than adrenaline.
4. c: His bilirubin is elevated but liver enzymes are
normal. This suggests that there is no damage to
the liver and diagnoses such as viral hepatitis,
cirrhosis and drug damage are unlikely. Gilbert’s
syndrome results from an impairment of bilirubin
conjugation, due to a deficiency of transcription of
the gene encoding the conjugating enzyme. In
illness this transcription is further impaired and the
patient may become frankly jaundiced. The rest of
the liver function tests are normal. Gilbert’s
syndrome is suggested by demonstrating that the
elevated bilirubin is unconjugated and excluding
haemolysis (normal reticulocyte count, serum
lactate dehydrogenase, haptoglobin). Jaundice
associated with hepatitis A, EBV infection, cirrhosis
and paracetamol overdose would cause a
conjugated hyperbilirubinaemia and there would
usually be other abnormalities of liver function.
5. c: She is in the immunotolerant phase of chronic
hepatitis B infection characterised by HBeAg
positivity and high levels of HBV DNA in the
blood. There are high levels of viral replication but

Part 3: Self-assessment

as her immune system is not reacting to this there
is minimal liver damage and the liver blood tests
are normal. In this situation she does not require
antiviral treatment but needs to be monitored in
the clinic as she remains at risk of developing
immune reactivation and a flare of hepatitis. With
HBeAg positivity and high levels of HBV DNA she
is highly infectious to others. She mostly likely
acquired the infection in Pakistan where the
prevalence of HBV is high. Infections acquired in
this area of the world are most commonly
transmitted by the vertical route or early childhood
contact. Anti-HB-core IgM antibody is associated
with acute infection; as she is a chronic carrier of
HBV the IgM anti-HBc will be negative.
6. e: Focal lesions of the liver are an extremely
common incidental finding on imaging and are not
usually the cause of the symptom for which the
scan was organised. In this case the gallstones are
much more likely to be the cause of her pain. Most
lesions detected incidentally are benign. The correct
management is to review the images with an
experienced hepatobiliary radiologist to decide
whether further imaging is required to fully
characterise the lesion. This will usually allow the
patient to be reassured and discharged. It is very
rare that lesions need to be biopsied. The oral
contraceptive pill is associated with development of
some liver lesions (e.g. adenoma) and may have to
be stopped.
7. b: Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) may be elevated in HCC
and can be a useful screening test for this disorder.
However. many HCCs are associated with a normal
AFP and an elevated AFP can be associated with
conditions without HCC (e.g. testicular tumours,
chronic viral hepatitis, liver regeneration). HCCs
take their blood supply from the hepatic arterial
circulation, therefore characteristic CT features are
arterial enhancement of the lesion followed by
washout in the portal venous phase. Ultrasound is
frequently able to demonstrate an HCC as a
hypoechoic lesion even on the background of a
nodular liver. Further characterisation with a CT or
MRI is recommended. In some situations it is
necessary to confirm the suspicion of HCC by
undertaking a liver biopsy; however, in many cases
the imaging appearances are strongly suggestive
and liver biopsy is not required. HCC is rarely
symptomatic in the early phases, therefore

high-risk patients (particularly those with cirrhosis)
should be entered into a surveillance programme
and undergo ultrasound imaging ± AFP estimation
every 6 months.
a: Primary sclerosing cholangitis is associated with
ulcerative colitis, particularly in men. It affects
intra- and extrahepatic bile ducts and
characteristically produces an elevation in alkaline
phosphatase. Primary biliary cirrhosis tends to
affect middle-aged women and there is no
association with inflammatory bowel disease.
Autoimmune hepatitis is associated with ulcerative
colitis but is more likely to produce a rise in
transaminases. Azathioprine hepatotoxicity and
metastatic disease are possible but less likely
diagnoses.
b: The very high ALT suggests inflammation of the
hepatic parenchyma, a hepatitis. Acute viral
hepatitis is the most likely cause and
characteristically has a viral prodrome before the
onset of jaundice, as in this case. Wilson’s disease is
a possible diagnosis but it is exceptionally rare and
therefore less likely to be the cause. Biliary
obstruction from gallstones is typically more
painful and associated with more marked elevations
in alkaline phosphatase rather than ALT. Gilbert’s
syndrome gives an isolated hyperbilirubinaemia,
other liver enzymes are normal. In alcoholic
hepatitis the ALT is rarely elevated to more than
200–300 iU/L.
e: Acute hepatic ischaemia may be asymptomatic. It
can be associated with large increases in
transaminases and sometimes impaired synthetic
function. The liver is relatively protected from
ischaemic insults due to its dual blood supply;
however the combination of hepatic congestion
and hypotension can provoke hepatic ischaemia, as
in this case. Viral hepatitis should always be
excluded in any patient presenting with acute
hepatitis, but there would often be a history of viral
prodrome. The time course of his deterioration is
too rapid for a drug-induced liver injury, which
often takes several weeks to develop. If Budd–
Chiari syndrome presents acutely there is usually
abdominal pain and ascites. Haemochromatosis
does not usually present with acute symptoms.
d: N-acetyl cysteine should be given as determined
by the paracetamol levels in the blood drawn at a
known time following the overdose. Patients on

enzyme-inducing drugs (e.g. anticonvulsants) and
alcoholics metabolise paracetamol to its toxic
metabolite more rapidly and should be treated at
lower serum levels of paracetamol. Guidelines for
treatment are available in all emergency
departments. Renal failure is relatively common
following a significant paracetamol overdose and
occurs due to a direct renal tubular injury by
paracetamol. The plasma ALT frequently rises into
the thousands but has little bearing on the
outcome, the important test is whether the liver
retains synthetic function, as assessed by the blood
coagulation. For that reason, derangement in
coagulation should not be corrected unless there is
life-threatening bleeding.
12. a: Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy usually
presents in the third trimester with pruritus. Liver
function tests are frequently abnormal but jaundice
is uncommon. Patients usually have elevated bile
acids. The condition resolves following delivery but
often recurs in subsequent pregnancies. Acute fatty
liver of pregnancy is a more serious condition
associated with jaundice, vomiting and abdominal
pain. Patients may progress to acute liver failure.
The HELLP syndrome (haemolysis, elevated liver
enzymes and low platelet count) is a severe form of
pre-eclampsia that may result in disseminated
intravascular coagulation. It resolves after delivery.
If there is derangement of liver function tests in
pregnancy other causes must always be excluded
but it is rare for hepatitis C and PBC to present
acutely.
13. c: Haemochromatosis can cause abnormal liver
function tests secondary to iron deposition in the
liver. Excess iron can also be deposited in other
organs including the pancreas (diabetes), heart
(arrhythmia and cardiac failure), skin
(pigmentation) and endocrine organs. Arthritis can
occur as a result of calcium pyrophosphate
deposition in joints. Drug-induced liver disease is
unlikely as the medications this patient is taking are
not usually hepatotoxic. Wilson’s disease presents
in young people, usually under the age of 40 years.
Congestive cardiac failure is more likely to result in
an elevated alkaline phosphatase than ALT. Alpha-1
antitrypsin deficiency is not associated with cardiac,
endocrine or joint problems.
14. d: A low caeruloplasmin suggests the disease but
levels can be low in acute liver failure of any cause

or in heterozygote carriers of the condition.
Kayser–Fleischer rings are suggestive of
neurological Wilson’s disease but they are not
specific and can be present in chronic cholestasis of
other causes. They are absent in up to 50% of
patients presenting with hepatological involvement.
Liver disease normally presents in children, and
presentation after the age of 40 is extremely rare.
Penicillamine is the most commonly used drug to
treat Wilson’s disease. Neurological symptoms may
get worse on commencing treatment.
15. c: Acute hepatic vein occlusion (Budd–Chiari
syndrome) results in obstruction to the outflow of
blood from the liver causing hepatic congestion,
which presents as painful hepatomegaly and ascites.
Up to half of cases of Budd–Chiari have an
underlying myeloproliferative disorder such as
polycythaemia rubra vera as a cause of the
hypercoagulable state. Hepatic venous outflow
obstruction should always be considered in a
patient presenting with painful hepatomegaly and
ascites. All the other causes are possible diagnoses
but the pain is not typically as severe a feature.
16. d: The major differential diagnosis for his jaundice
is progressive PSC with benign structuring of his
bile ducts or the development of a
cholangiocarcinoma. It can be very difficult to
determine this. A MRCP is useful to look at the
anatomy of the bile ducts and the nature of the
stricturing; benign and malignant strictures may
have characteristic features. Cross-sectional imaging
(CT or MRI) will be helpful to look for the
presence of a mass lesion. CA19.9 can be elevated
in biliary obstruction of any cause and is not
specific for a cholangiocarcinoma in this setting.
Cholangiocarcinoma may be poorly visualised on
ultrasound and the lack of a mass lesion is not
reassuring. Cholangiocarcinoma is a
contraindication for liver transplantation due to
the very high risk of the tumour recurring.
17. a: Sexual transmission of HCV in heterosexual
monogamous relationships is considered to be
extremely rare and no specific precautions are
recommended. Sexual practice involving a high risk
of trauma to the anogenital mucosa, however, has
been associated with an increased risk of
transmitting the virus. It is not just sharing needles
that puts intravenous drug users at risk of
transmitting the virus; transmission has also been

Part 3: Self-assessment

associated with sharing equipment for preparing
the drugs (e.g. cookers, spoons, water, etc.). HCV
may be associated with vertical transmission but
the risk is low, about the order of 6%. It is rarely
passed on by breast feeding and patients should not
be discouraged from doing this. A needlestick
injury from an HCV-positive person is associated
with approximately a 3% risk of transmitting the
virus (with hepatitis B virus it is approximately
30% and with HIV it is 0.3%).
18. b: The main contraindications to percutaneous
liver biopsy include: coagulopathy (INR >1.4,
platelet count <60 × 109/L), the presence of
significant ascites (as bleeding into the ascites could
occur), a dilated biliary system (bleeding could
result in haemobilia), infection in the biliary system
(risk of disseminating sepsis) and an uncooperative
patient. In patients with coagulopathy or ascites,
liver biopsy may be performed safely via the
transjugular route. The risk of mortality following a
liver biopsy is 0.05–0.001%. Complex cystic lesions
should be evaluated with great caution before
considering biopsy and negative hydatid serology
should be confirmed prior to biopsy since biopsy of
a hydatid cyst can be associated with severe
anaphylactic shock.
19. d: The current treatment for HCV is a combination
of pegylated interferon and ribavirin; it is
associated with sustained viral eradication in about
50% of patients (70–80% in patients with viral
genotype 2 or 3 and 35–40% in patients with other
genotypes). Most people who acquire HCV
infection are asymptomatic; acute hepatitis and
jaundice is rare. The majority of people exposed to
the virus (approximately 85%) progress to chronic
infection and are at risk of sustaining liver damage.
Not all patients develop progressive liver disease
however; the incidence of cirrhosis is approximately
10% at 10 years after infection and 20% at 20 years,
and plateaus thereafter. If a patient clears the virus
(either naturally or following antiviral therapy),
HCV RNA is lost from the serum but HCV
antibodies normally remain, therefore these
individuals will retain a positive HCV antibody test.
Cirrhosis secondary to chronic HCV infection is
the leading indication for liver transplantation in
most centres. Viral recurrence is nearly universal,
however, and associated with more rapid liver
injury.

20. c: In cirrhosis there is an alteration in splanchnic
haemodynamics resulting in vasodilatation with
pooling of blood in the splanchnic system.
Consequently, the systemic circulation is
underfilled resulting in renal hypoperfusion. This
in turn activates the rennin–angiotensin–
aldosterone system resulting in an elevation of
plasma renin activity. The high aldosterone leads to
avid sodium and water retention, thus urinary
sodium levels are often low. Hyponatraemia often
occurs but, as total body sodium is already
elevated, it is not helped by infusion of saline;
treatment is aimed at restricting water intake.
Ascites usually begins to form before urea and
creatinine become deranged, once they do it may
signify the hepatorenal syndrome, a condition
associated with a high mortality. Cirrhotic ascites is
a transudate and the albumin content is usually low
unless it is complicated, e.g. by infection or
malignancy.
21. e: Diuretics may precipitate encephalopathy by
causing dehydration and electrolyte disturbances,
particularly derangement of sodium and potassium.
There are many precipitants for encephalopathy
and these should be actively sought and reversed if
possible (e.g. infection, bleeding, drug toxicity,
etc.). Blood ammonia levels may be elevated in
hepatic encephalopathy but there are other causes,
including urea cycle disorders and other metabolic
disorders. Insertion of a TIPS may precipitate or
worsen existing hepatic encephalopathy as it allows
a portion of the portal venous blood supply to
bypass the liver, enter the systemic circulation and
reach the brain. It also causes an element of hepatic
ischaemia, reducing the ability of the liver to
perform its metabolic functions. A hepatic asterixis
or flap may be present in encephalopathy but it is
often absent in the early phases and later when the
patient becomes drowsy. It is not diagnostic of the
disorder and may be seen in other conditions such
as carbon dioxide retention.
22. b: This woman has a classic presentation of
primary biliary cirrhosis in a relatively advanced
form. Antimitochondrial antibodies (AMAs) are
positive in approximately 95% of cases. If the
biochemical and clinical features of the
presentation are typical and AMAs are positive a
liver biopsy is not necessary to make the diagnosis.
Steroids are not used to treat PBC as they are

associated with worsening of the osteoporosis
associated with this disorder. Whilst her liver
disease is likely to be a key cause of the elevated
alkaline phosphatase, her cholestasis also puts her
at risk of deficiency of fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E
and K). Vitamin D deficiency can lead to
osteomalacia and an elevation of the bone
isoenzyme of alkaline phosphatase.
Hypercholesterolaemia and the development of
xanthelasmata are common in PBC but there is no
clear evidence that it is associated with an increase
in cardiovascular morbidity and treatment of
patients with normal levels of cholesterol is not
required.
23. e: A TIPS creates a communication between
branches of the intrahepatic portal and hepatic
veins forming a portosystemic shunt. This provides
a low resistance route for blood to flow through the
liver, reducing the portal venous hypertension and
decompressing the varices, which usually arrests
bleeding. It is often employed when endoscopic
methods have failed to control the bleeding. The
advent of TIPS has almost completely replaced
emergency shunt surgery in the management of
these patients. Occasionally, patients require
balloon tamponade of bleeding varices to allow safe
transfer for emergency endoscopy or TIPS. This
procedure is associated with a high risk of
complications, however, and should only be
performed if bleeding cannot be controlled by
another means. Patients who have successful
endoscopic therapy should have repeat endoscopy
and banding at 1–2-week intervals until the varices
have been eradicated. Terlipressin reduces bleeding
and has also been shown to reduce the mortality
associated with variceal bleeding.
24. b: Alpha-1 antitrypsin is an inherited disorder
resulting in accumulation of α1-antitrypsin globules
within hepatocytes, which can eventually lead to
cirrhosis. Smokers in particular are at risk of lung
injury due to unopposed action of proteolytic
enzymes in the lungs. Cystic fibrosis can cause
respiratory symptoms and cirrhosis but usually
presents in childhood or as a young adult.
Haemochromatosis is an inherited disorder that
can cause cirrhosis and may also be associated with
arthritis but not respiratory involvement. Hepatic
hydrothorax occurs when ascites tracks into the
pleural space. Features of portal hypertension

would usually be evident. Porto-pulmonary
hypertension is also a complication of portal
hypertension associated with the development of
pulmonary arterial hypertension, which produces
breathlessness.
25. c: The history is typical of the carcinoid syndrome.
Symptoms occur because 5-HT produced from the
liver lesions is able to access the systemic
circulation. Breast or colorectal metastases do not
usually enhance in the arterial phase on CT
scanning and should not produce flushing.
Abscesses produce arterially enhancing lesions in
the liver but the patient is usually quite unwell with
a fever. Hepatic adenomas should not have
systemic symptoms.
26. a: Cholangiocarcinoma is currently an absolute
contraindication to liver transplantation as it has
an extremely high incidence of recurrence after the
transplant. In contrast, small hepatocellular
carcinomas are a very good indication for liver
transplantation and if patients are carefully
selected the incidence of recurrence after
transplantation is low. Patients have to fit criteria
regarding the size and number of lesions and there
must not be any evidence of spread outside the
liver or invasion of the major vascular structures.
HIV infection is not an absolute contraindication
to transplantation, although infection that is not
amenable to antiretroviral therapy or a
diagnosis of AIDS is. Cirrhosis caused by HCV
infection is the commonest indication for liver
transplantation in the Western world.
Transplantation is often indicated for paracetamolinduced liver failure in patients who meet defined
criteria that predict a very low chance of
spontaneous recovery.
27. c: Antibiotics are a common cause of acute liver
injury with jaundice. Agents such as flucloxacillin
or augmentin can give rise to a cholestatic hepatitis
with jaundice. The reaction may occur a few weeks
after stopping the drug and take several weeks to
resolve. Autoimmune hepatitis and CMV hepatitis
are possible diagnoses in this woman but are less
likely than antibiotic-associated jaundice. Budd–
Chiari syndrome typically presents with pain,
jaundice and ascites. Primary biliary cirrhosis does
not present acutely; patients with this condition
usually have a history of lethargy and pruritus for
several years and jaundice develops slowly.

28. e: This patient has a high BMI and steatosis in his
liver, the most likely diagnosis is therefore
non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Although he has
simple steatosis now he is at risk of developing
steatohepatitis and fibrosis over the coming years.
Furthermore, hepatic steatosis indicates an
increased risk of developing the metabolic
syndrome with diabetes and premature ischaemic
heart disease. He should be advised to lose weight
through a diet and exercise regime and other risk
factors for steatosis (e.g. diabetes and
hyperlipidaemia) should be sought and treated as
appropriate. His alcohol intake is a little high and
he should be advised to reduce this, but in a man
with such an elevated BMI it is unlikely that
reducing alcohol alone will improve his liver
dysfunction.
29. d: The histological features are suggestive of
autoimmune hepatitis and she has other
autoimmune disorders making this a likely
diagnosis. A proportion of patients do not have
positive autoantibodies and this should not put you
off the diagnosis if the history and histological
features fit. She has active inflammation on her
liver biopsy and this has a high chance of
progressing and developing fibrosis if left
untreated. Treatment is likely to be required long
term. Corticosteroids act quickly to control
inflammation and should be started as soon as the

diagnosis is made. It typically takes over a year to
bring about histological remission and steroidsparing immunosuppression (e.g. azathioprine) is
required and should be commenced early on. A
repeat liver biopsy is often required to confirm
histological remission prior to discontinuing
steroids.
30. b: The history and blood results are typical of a
diagnosis of acute alcoholic hepatitis; however,
other disorders can present in this way or coexist
with alcoholic hepatitis. This patient should
therefore be fully assessed with blood tests to look
for other causes of acute or chronic liver disease
and abdominal imaging to look for abnormalities
of the hepatic vasculature or focal lesions within
the liver. Severe alcoholic hepatitis, as in this case,
has a high risk of mortality of the order of 50%.
Alcoholic hepatitis should be treated by optimising
nutrition and feeding by a nasogastric tube is
frequently required. Patients require a high protein
diet as they are frequently very malnourished with
marked protein loss. His creatinine is at the upper
end of normal but as most patients with alcoholic
hepatitis have a low muscle mass they should have
a lower creatinine. A creatinine near the top of the
normal range is therefore often abnormal in these
patients and should be taken as an indicator of
renal dysfunction.

1. g: Paracetamol overdose. Rapid development of
hepatitis with confusion and coagulopathy is highly
suggestive of acute liver failure. Bilateral
subconjunctival haemorrhage is a feature of
paracetamol hepatotoxicity.
2. b: Gilbert’s syndrome. Jaundice accompanying a
systemic illness is characteristic of Gilbert’s
syndrome. Jaundice resolves spontaneously and the
patient is well in between episodes. It is caused by a
reduction in activity of the enzyme responsible for
bilirubin conjugation.
3. c: Common bile duct stones. The history of
recurrent abdominal pain after meals is typical of
biliary colic. A subsequent episode of painful
jaundice suggests a gallstone has migrated out of the
gallbladder into the common bile duct and is
causing obstruction.
4. d: Alcoholic hepatitis. He has evidence of
decompensated liver disease (ascites and jaundice).
The presence of Dupuytren’s contracture, parotid
enlargement and florid spider naevi suggest alcohol
as the diagnosis.
5. a: Carcinoma of the head of the pancreas. Painless
jaundice is typical of pancreatic carcinoma.
New-onset diabetes is sometimes a presenting
feature as the tumour invades the gland, destroying
the islets of Langerhan. A palpable gallbladder in the
presence of jaundice is suggestive of pancreatic
cancer (Courvoisier’s law).

some HCCs are associated with a normal AFP. HCC
typically takes its blood supply from the hepatic
artery and is therefore seen to enhance on the
arterial phase of a CT scan.
g: Pyogenic abscess. Infection in the gastrointestinal
tract can result in pyogenic material entering the
portal vein by which it can travel to the liver and
establish infection there in the form of single or
multiple abscesses. Patients with liver abscesses
present unwell with generalised symptoms of
infection (e.g. fever, lethargy, weight loss) and may
also have right upper quadrant pain.
b: Hepatic adenoma. This rare benign tumour is
often seen in association with hormone use (e.g. oral
contraceptive pill or anabolic steroids). It is
frequently asymptomatic and an incidental finding.
Occasionally it can present as an emergency with
pain and shock due to haemorrhage.
c: Cholangiocarcinoma. This malignant tumour of
the biliary epithelium frequently develops in patients
with longstanding biliary disease, particularly
primary sclerosing cholangitis. It may occur in the
extrahepatic bile ducts when it usually causes biliary
obstruction and jaundice. Intrahepatic
cholangiocarcinomas may not cause symptoms until
they are large and treatment options are limited.
h: Hydatid cyst. These occur during infection with
the parasite Echinococcus. Eggs are ingested and
release small worms that travel in the blood stream
to various organs, including the liver, where they
can develop into large cysts containing the
tapeworm larvae. If this lesion is biopsied, the larvae
may be released into the blood stream causing an
anaphylactic reaction.

1. e: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). HCC occurs
most frequently on a background of cirrhosis. Other
lesions are uncommon in a cirrhotic liver. A raised
α-fetoprotein (AFP) is often observed although

question is whether her liver is able to perform
synthetic functions and a test of blood coagulation
such as the INR is the most appropriate test.
a: Liver ultrasound. An ultrasound will look for
structural causes for her pain, e.g. gallstones (most
likely in this case), focal liver lesions or other
abdominal pathology.
e: MRCP. An elevated alkaline phosphatase suggests
a cholestatic or obstructive problem. In a patient
with ulcerative colitis, the fibrotic, structuring biliary
disease primary sclerosing cholangitis is likely. This
is often well demonstrated on an MRCP
examination which is preferred to ERCP as a
first-line test as it avoids the risks of pancreatitis,
bleeding and infection that can be associated with an
ERCP.
d: Chronic liver disease screen. There are many
causes of an elevated ALT. A full chronic liver
disease screen should be checked for patients with
deranged liver function tests to exclude a viral,
immunological or metabolic cause.
a: Liver ultrasound. His history is suggestive of
cholestasis. Ultrasound is the first-line investigation;
if biliary duct dilatation is present further
investigation can be organised to look for an
obstructive cause. If there is no duct dilatation it
suggests an intrahepatic cholestasis, which will
require further evaluation with a detailed drug
history, chronic liver disease screen and possibly a
liver biopsy.

1. h: Fulminant liver failure. Patients presenting with
fulminant liver failure secondary to HBV frequently
have already cleared the virus from the body. Viral
antigens (HBsAg and HBeAg) and HBV DNA are
therefore often negative. IgG antibodies have not yet
been produced, therefore the only evidence of HBV
infection is the IgM anti-HBc antibody. As there is
hepatic necrosis ALT is often very high
(2000–10 000 iU/L).
2. b: Post-HBV vaccination. HBV vaccine contains
only HBsAg, the patient is exposed to no other viral
antigens. Therefore, the only antibody produced is
anti-HBs, which confers protective immunity.
3. g: Hepatitis B and D co-infection. The patient has
IgM antibodies to both HBV core antigen and HDV.
The most likely explanation for this is co-infection
with the two viruses.

4. f: Clearance of HBV. The presence of anti-HBc
indicates that the patient has been exposed to
HBV; they have cleared HBsAg and therefore no
longer carry the virus. The presence of anti-HBs
indicates that they have produced a protective
antibody.
5. c: Immunotolerant HBV. In a healthy
immunotolerant person large amounts of virus
circulate in the body, HBV DNA levels are high but
the lack of an immune response results in normal
ALT. This occurs prior to HBeAg seroconversion,
therefore HBeAg is positive and anti-HBe is
negative.

1. g: Crigler–Najjar syndrome type 1. This is a rare,
autosomal recessive disorder characterised by a total
absence of the bilirubin conjugating enzyme. Infants
become deeply jaundiced with unconjugated
hyperbilirubinaemia. If untreated the unconjugated
bilirubin crosses the blood–brain barrier resulting in
brain damage (kernicterus) and death.
2. d: Physiological jaundice. Most babies who are
breast fed develop mild jaundice in the first 2 weeks
of life. It is not present at birth, peaks at 2–5 days
and then disappears. It is due to excess destruction
of red blood cells and immaturity of the conjugating
system in the first days of life. Bilirubin is
unconjugated and the urine and stools are normal
colour.
3. b: Biliary atresia. A disorder characterised by
gradual fibrosis and obliteration of the extra- and
intrahepatic biliary ducts. Jaundice begins to
develop on the second day and gradually
progresses. Bilirubin is conjugated but not
excreted into the gastrointestinal tract thus the
stools become pale and the urine dark. If
infants are operated on early and biliary drainage
achieved, excessive liver damage can be avoided, if
not the infant develops progressive liver fibrosis and
liver failure.
4. f: Congenital CMV infection. This devastating
syndrome occurs when a mother develops CMV
infection during pregnancy and passes it onto the
fetus. Infants are usually of low birth weight and
may have abnormalities including microcephaly,
retinal damage and brain damage. Pneumonia and
hepatitis with jaundice may occur.

1. i: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Fat infiltration of
the liver is very common in patients with obesity,
particularly those with features of the metabolic
syndrome such as diabetes and
hypercholesterolaemia.
2. a: Wilson’s disease. This is a very rare disorder that
presents in young people and can lead to irreversible
brain damage or liver damage including acute liver
failure or cirrhosis. It should be considered in any
young person presenting with liver disease; it would
be exceptionally rare for it to present over the age of
40 years.
3. j: Chronic hepatitis C virus infection. Patients who
received blood products prior to screening for HCV
are at risk of having acquired the virus. Patients with
haemophilia were at particular risk as factor VIII
was obtained from pooled donated blood making it
possible that large number of recipients were
infected from a single infected donor.
4. c: Primary biliary cirrhosis. She has a classic
presentation of this disorder, which primarily affects
middle-aged women and presents with tiredness and
features of cholestasis, e.g. pruritus.
5. f: Constrictive pericarditis. She has features of
cardiac failure, which in this case is caused by
pericardial disease related to her precious
radiotherapy. With cardiac failure from any cause,
the liver can become congested which results in
engorgement with blood, hepatomegaly and
ascites.

7
1. e: Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. Any patient
with cirrhosis presenting with deterioration in their
clinical condition should be evaluated for the
possibility of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. In
this woman the serum–ascitic albumin gradient is
8 g/L indicating that the fluid is an exudate and that
a complication such as infection is possible. In this
setting, the elevated ascitic white cell count should
be assumed to reflect infection. Ascites commonly
causes mild elevation of CA125 and does not
necessarily indicate ovarian malignancy.

2. b: Abdominal tuberculosis. The ascitic fluid is an
exudate and has a high content of cells associated
with TB.
3. a: Budd–Chiari syndrome. The development of
painful hepatomegaly and ascites should always raise
the suspicion of the Budd–Chiari syndrome. This
can complicate myeloproliferative disorders and
other procoagulant disorders.
4. i: Metastatic colorectal carcinoma. Malignancy is a
common cause of ascites. Fluid should always be
sent for cytology to look for malignant cells.
5. f: Pancreatitis. Chronic pancreatitis may lead to a
pancreatic fistula with a direct communication
between the pancreatic duct and the peritoneal
cavity. The fluid has a high protein content and an
elevated amylase.

8
1. d: Pregnancy. The alkaline phosphatase is raised as it
is produced by the placenta; if isoenzymes were
checked there would be no elevation in the liver
ALP. Albumin is low due to haemodilution that
occurs due to the increased plasma volume
characteristic of pregnancy. Alpha-fetoprotein is
produced by the fetus and elevated levels are seen in
maternal blood during pregnancy.
2. a: Paracetamol overdose. She has acute liver failure
characterised by coagulopathy. As this is not
corrected by vitamin K it is due to a failure of liver
synthesis rather than cholestasis. The most common
cause of liver failure in the UK is a paracetamol
overdose and this is the most likely cause when ALT
is elevated to this degree.
3. j: Cirrhosis. Liver blood tests are completely normal
but this does not exclude serious liver disease. It is
quite common for patients with cirrhosis to have
normal liver biochemistry. Other clues need to be
sought such as a low platelet count indicating
hypersplenism and portal hypertension.
4. b: Gilbert’s syndrome. There is an isolated
hyperbilirubinaemia making a prehepatic cause of
jaundice the most likely. The history is suggestive of
the common and benign disorder, Gilbert’s
syndrome. Providing haemolysis is excluded the
patient can be reassured.
5. g: Gallstone obstruction of the common bile duct.
The pattern of abnormality in her liver blood tests
suggests cholestasis, as would be caused by

5. i: Sepsis from umbilical stump infection. Infection of
any site in the neonatal period can impair bilirubin
conjugation, resulting in jaundice.

Part 3: Self-assessment

obstruction of bile flow. The INR reverses with
intravenous vitamin K because this fat-soluble
vitamin is not absorbed from the gastrointestinal
tract when there is cholestasis.

PA R T 3 : S E L F - A S S E S S M E N T

1. e: Hepatitis E virus. Most cases of acute viral
hepatitis have a relatively low mortality risk,
however acute hepatitis E virus infection produces a
particularly devastating illness in pregnant women
and the mortality rate is around 20%.
2. b: Hepatitis B virus. Chronic hepatitis B virus
infection is very common in African countries such
as Zimbabwe. Chronic carriers are often well but if
the immune system is disturbed, such as with
chemotherapy, it can lead to an aggressive hepatitis
that can lead to liver failure and be fatal.
3. d: Hepatitis D virus. There are many causes of a
patient with hepatitis B virus deteriorating but
superadded hepatitis D virus infection should always
be considered.
4. c: Hepatitis C virus. Intravenous drug users are at
risk of having chronic hepatitis B and C viruses. A
health care worker is probably vaccinated against
hepatitis B virus, therefore it is more likely that they
have acquired hepatitis C virus.
5. b: Hepatitis B virus. Hepatitis B is spread by sexual
contact, both heterosexual and homosexual. As well
as hepatitis and cirrhosis it causes hepatocellular
carcinoma.

10
1. j: Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. Deficiency of
α1-antitrypsin predisposes to lung destruction,
which presents as emphysema, especially in smokers.
Abnormal α1-antitrypsin globules accumulate in
hepatocytes and can lead to the development of
fibrosis and cirrhosis.
2. a: Methotrexate. Chronic use of methotrexate for
conditions such as psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis
can lead to fibrosis in the liver. If the drug is
continued, this can progress to cirrhosis in a
minority of cases.
3. c: Cystic fibrosis. Respiratory symptoms
predominate in this chronic disorder, however as
respiratory treatments have improved patients are
living longer and suffer from the effects of thickened
secretions on other organs. In the liver this can
result in a biliary cirrhosis. Pancreatic involvement
can lead to exocrine deficiency (chronic pancreatitis)
and endocrine abnormalities (diabetes).
4. d: Haemochromatosis. Iron overload in
haemochromatosis affects multiple organ systems
including the liver (cirrhosis), pancreas (diabetes),
heart (arrhythmias, cardiomyopathy) and endocrine
organs (gonadal dysfunction).
5. f: Primary sclerosing cholangitis. This chronic biliary
disorder is associated with inflammatory bowel
disease.

a. Prehepatic, hepatic and posthepatic.
b. • Prehepatic: Isolated raised bilirubin (ALT and
ALP normal). Bilirubin is unconjugated.
• Hepatic: Rise in ALT is higher than the rise in
ALP. Bilirubin is unconjugated and conjugated.
• Posthepatic: Rise in ALP is higher than the rise in
ALT. Bilirubin is conjugated.
c. • Prehepatic: Previous history or family history
(Gilbert’s syndrome); family history of anaemia or
splenectomy (haemolysis).
• Hepatic: Alcohol history; viral hepatitis risk
(recent travel, blood transfusion, sexual risk,
intravenous drug use); drug history (prescribed and
over the counter drugs); autoimmune disease history
(autoimmune hepatitis, PBC, PSC).

urine; previous biliary surgery (retained gallstones,
biliary stricture); fever/rigor (cholangitis)?
• General: Weight loss (malignancy or advanced
liver disease)?
d. • Prehepatic: Anaemia; splenomegaly
(haemolysis).
• Hepatic: Systemic features of chronic liver disease
(clubbing, spider naevi, palmar erythema,
leuconychia, Dupuytren’s contracture, bruising,
purpura, gynaecomastia); abdomen (ascites,
hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, caput medusae).
• Posthepatic: Palpable gallbladder (likely not
caused by gallstones); pale stools.

a. A calculation made by subtracting the albumin
concentration of the ascitic fluid from the albumin
concentration of a serum specimen obtained on the
same day.
b. • SAAG <11 g/L: High protein-containing ascites,
e.g. intra-abdominal malignancy, infection including
tuberculosis, pancreatitis, nephrotic syndrome,
protein-losing enteropathy.
• SAAG >11 g/L: Low protein-containing ascites,
e.g. cirrhosis, congestive cardiac failure, constrictive
pericarditis, Budd-Chiari syndrome.
c. • Splanchnic vasodilatation results in relative
underfilling of the systemic circulation and renal
hypoperfusion. This in turn activates the rennin–
angiotensin–aldosterone system resulting in avid salt
and water retention.
• Reduced synthesis of plasma proteins, e.g.
albumin, results in low plasma oncotic pressure.
• Portal hypertension raises capillary hydrostatic
pressure in the splanchnic vascular bed.
d. • Bed rest (if practical) increases renal perfusion
and salt and water excretion.
• Low salt diet.
191

PA R T 3 : S E L F - A S S E S S M E N T

a. Increased delivery of nitrogenous material to the
brain. Many factors are involved, e.g. impaired
hepatic metabolism of toxins, nitrogenous material
bypassing the liver altogether through portosystemic
shunts and overproduction of toxins due to
increased risk of infection.
b. Constipation, gastrointestinal bleeding, drugs (e.g.
opiates, sedatives), infection, electrolyte disturbances
and venous thrombosis.
c. Full septic screen (urine, chest, blood cultures,
ascitic tap) and serum electrolytes.
d. Treat any underlying precipitant (e.g. correct
electrolyte disturbances, give antibiotics for
infection, stop sedative drugs), give laxatives to
encourage bowel emptying, and provide general
supportive measures for drowsy, confused patients
(e.g. ensure airway protection, nutrition, skin care,
etc.).

• Diuretics (spironolactone is preferred as it inhibits

aldosterone; furosemide may be required in addition).
• Paracentesis with intravenous albumin
replacement.
• Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt in
selected cases with good liver function.
• Liver transplantation should be considered in
cases of ascites refractory to medical therapy.

a. Variceal haemorrhage (oesophageal, gastric), peptic
ulcer disease (gastric or duodenal ulceration),
mucosal inflammation (oesophagitis, gastritis,
duodenitis) and Mallory–Weiss tear.
b. Ensure airway protection, obtain good intravenous
access (at least two large bore cannulae) and fluid
resuscitation (crystalloid, colloid, blood and clotting
factors including platelets). Once the patient is stable
proceed to emergency endoscopy.
c. Variceal band ligation (preferred modality of
treatment, lower complication rate) and
sclerotherapy (injection of ethanolamine, a
sclerosant, is effective in controlling bleeding but
risks include oesophageal ulceration, perforation and
mediastinitis).
d. Administration of vasoactive drug (e.g. terlipressin
or octreotide) to reduce splanchnic blood flow and
lower the portal blood pressure. Administer
intravenous antibiotics to prevent infection and
reduce the incidence of rebleeding.

a. An inherited disorder of iron metabolism
characterised by iron overload with deposition of
iron in various tissues of the body.
b. 25% (genetic haemochromatosis is an autosomal
recessive disorder). Her serum ferritin is elevated
but is not particularly high. This could be because it
is caused by an alternative disorder (e.g. nonalcoholic fatty liver disease) or because she is a
menstruating female who is protected from iron
overload to a certain extent by the monthly blood
loss.
c. • Transferrin saturation (useful in patients with a
high likelihood of having the disorder, less useful in
screening).
• Genetic testing: The majority of cases are
homozygous for the C282Y mutation in the HFE

gene. A less severe genetic mutation is the H63D
mutation which may occasionally be associated with
disease in a C282Y/H63D heterozygote. Other
genetic causes are described.
• A liver biopsy may be required to assess the
degree of hepatic damage and iron overload and to
look for alternative causes of her raised liver
function tests.
d. Liver (fibrosis, cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma),
pancreas (diabetes), skin (bronze pigmentation),
heart (arrhythmia, cardiomyopathy, heart failure),
joints (arthritis) and endocrine glands (endocrine
dysfunction, particularly gonadal failure).

6
a. Intraluminal, mural and extramural.
b. • Intraluminal: Gallstones (common); parasites (rare).
• Mural: Carcinoma (cholangiocarcinoma,
ampullary carcinoma); benign biliary stricture (e.g.
primary sclerosing cholangitis, biliary inflammation
or instrumentation).
• Extramural: Pancreatic carcinoma; duodenal
carcinoma; hepatic hilar lymphadenopathy.
c. • MRCP: This demonstrates the anatomy of the
biliary system, the site and characteristics of the
narrowing and can demonstrate some causes, e.g.
gallstones within the bile ducts.
• CT abdomen: This demonstrates the pathology in
the surrounding tissues (e.g. pancreas, duodenum).
It may demonstrate gallstones but these are often
not seen on CT imaging.
d. • ERCP: Endoscopic instrumentation of the biliary
system can allow retrieval of stones or dilatation and
stenting of the stricture.
Percutaneous transhepatic cholangiogram:
Percutaneous puncture of a dilated biliary radical
can access the biliary tree and permit drainage of
bile as well as dilatation and stenting of strictures.
Surgery: The biliary system may be accessed at
surgery where the obstruction can be removed or a
loop of bowel can be anastomosed above the
obstruction to act as a bypass.

a. The striking elevation is in the ALT, which is an
enzyme of the hepatocyte and suggests a
predominantly hepatitic injury.

a. Liver lesions can be benign or malignant. Benign
lesions may arise from hepatocytes, biliary
epithelium or other structures. Malignant lesions
can be primary or secondary.
b. • Benign: Hepatocyte origin (focal nodular
hyperplasia, hepatic adenoma); biliary origin (bile
duct adenoma, biliary cyst adenoma); other
(haemangioma, hepatic cyst).
• Malignant: Primary (hepatocellular carcinoma,
cholangiocarcinoma, primary hepatic lymphoma);
secondary (spread from gastrointestinal, lung, breast
or other primary).
c. • Previous cancer elsewhere (breast, lung,
gastrointestinal).
• History suggestive of current cancer elsewhere
(weight loss, respiratory or gastrointestinal
symptoms).
• Risk factors for chronic liver disease: alcohol
intake; risk factors for non-alcoholic fatty liver
disease and the metabolic syndrome (diabetes,
cholesterol, body mass index); viral hepatitis risk
factors; autoimmune disease or inflammatory bowel
disease.
d. • Liver function tests.
• Blood tests to screen for chronic liver disease.
• Tumour markers (α-fetoprotein, CA19.9,
carcinoembryonic antigen, CA125).
• Further imaging after discussion with a radiologist
(e.g. CT scan, MRI scan).

9
a. • Fatty change: Fat is deposited in hepatocytes
mainly in zone 3 of the liver.

• Alcoholic hepatitis: Steatosis is often present.

In addition there are swollen hepatocytes,
hepatocyte necrosis and a neutrophilic infiltrate in
the liver.
• Cirrhosis: Fibrosis surrounds nodules of
regenerating hepatocytes classically in a
micronodular pattern. Steatosis and features of
alcoholic hepatitis may be present.
• Hepatocellular carcinoma: Alcoholic cirrhosis may
be complicated by the development of hepatocellular
carcinoma.
b. • Nervous system: Wernicke–Korsakoff syndrome,
neuropathy, epilepsy.
• Endocrine: Pancreatitis, pancreatic carcinoma,
gonadal dysfunction.
• Cardiovascular: Cardiomyopathy, arrhythmias,
hypertension.
• Gastrointestinal tract: Inflammation, peptic ulcer
disease, carcinoma.
• Muscles: Myopathy.
• Bone: Osteoporosis.
• Bone marrow: Thrombocytopenia, macrocytosis.
c. Liver failure (coagulopathy and bleeding,
encephalopathy), renal failure, sepsis, malnutrition
and death (up to 50% in severe cases).
d. Severe cases need to be admitted to hospital.
Management is largely supportive: optimising
nutrition, including nasogastric feeding if required;
sepsis should be sought and treated promptly;
careful fluid management to detect and treat renal
impairment promptly. Specific treatment with
corticosteroids or pentoxifylline in selected cases.

a. Cirrhosis is a response to chronic liver injury. It
affects the whole of the liver, which becomes
replaced by fibrous scar tissue surrounding nodules
of regenerative liver.

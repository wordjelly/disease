t is a pleasure to present the new edition of The Washington Manual®
Subspecialty Consult Series: Hematology/Oncology Subspecialty Consult. This
pocket-size book continues to be a primary reference for medical students, interns,
residents, and other practitioners who need ready access to practical clinical
information to diagnose and treat patients with a wide variety of disorders. Medical
knowledge continues to increase at an astounding rate, which creates a challenge for
physicians to keep up with the biomedical discoveries, genetic and genomic
information, and novel therapeutics that can positively impact patient outcomes. The
Washington Manual Subspecialty Series addresses this challenge by concisely and
practically providing current scientific information for clinicians to aid them in the
diagnosis, investigation, and treatment of common medical conditions.
I want to personally thank the authors, which include house officers, fellows,
and attendings at Washington University School of Medicine and Barnes-Jewish
Hospital. Their commitment to patient care and education is unsurpassed, and their
efforts and skill in compiling this manual are evident in the quality of the final
product. In particular, I would like to acknowledge our editors, Drs. Amanda Cashen
and Brian A. Van Tine, and the series editors, Drs. Katherine Henderson and Tom
De Fer, who have worked tirelessly to produce another outstanding edition of this
manual. I would also like to thank Dr. Melvin Blanchard, Chief of the Division of
Medical Education in the Department of Medicine at Washington University School
of Medicine, for his advice and guidance. I believe this Subspecialty Manual will
meet its desired goal of providing practical knowledge that can be directly applied
at the bedside and in outpatient settings to improve patient care.

e are pleased to present the third edition of The Washington Manual™
Hematology and Oncology Subspecialty Consult. The field of medical oncology
continues to advance at a remarkable pace. Every year, new indications are found
for existing therapies and new anti-cancer drugs are approved. Staging systems,
classifications, and prognostic models are in flux, reflecting the discovery of new
biomarkers, changes in treatment algorithms, and the general improvement in patient
outcomes. Therapeutic advances have also been made in benign hematology,
particularly with the introduction of novel anticoagulants.
This edition has been updated to include new standards in the treatment of
malignancies and hematologic disorders, mechanisms of action of new therapeutic
agents, and current use of molecular prognostic factors. The information in each
chapter is now presented in a consistent format, with important references cited. Our
goal is to provide a concise, practical reference for fellows, residents, and medical
students rotating on hematology and oncology subspecialty services. Most of the
authors are hematology–oncology fellows or internal medicine residents, the
physicians who have recent experience with the issues and questions that arise in the
course of training in these subspecialties. Primary care practitioners and other health
care professionals also will find this manual useful as a quick reference source in
hematology and oncology.
As the practice of hematology and oncology continues to evolve, changes in
dosing and indications for chemotherapy and targeted therapies will occur, and
staging systems will be modified. We recommend a handbook of chemotherapy
regimens and an oncology staging manual to complement the information in this
book. And of course, clinical judgment is imperative when applying the principles
presented here to the care of individual patients.
We appreciate the effort and expertise of everyone who contributed to this
edition of the Hematology and Oncology Subspecialty Consult. In particular, we
would like to thank the authors for their enthusiastic efforts to distill volumes of
medical advances into a concise, useable format. We also recognize the faculty in
the divisions of hematology, oncology, bone marrow transplantation, radiation
14

oncology, and gynecologic oncology at Washington University for their mentorship
and commitment to education.

GENERAL PRINCIPLES

Approach to the Hematology Patient

Hematologic diseases are a heterogeneous group of diseases that can have
multiple clinical and laboratory manifestations that mimic nonhematologic diseases.
History, physical exam, labs, peripheral smear, and bone marrow biopsy are critical
in making the correct diagnosis. The diseases can be approached by identifying the
primary hematologic component that is affected: RBCs, WBCs, platelets, or the
coagulation system. The major abnormalities in hematology are quantitative in
nature, with either excessive or deficient production of one of the hematopoietic
constituents (e.g., leukemias, anemias). Qualitative abnormalities that can be
inherited (e.g., sickle cell disease) or acquired also occur.
DIAGNOSIS

Clinical Presentation
History

The medical history is, of course, the first step in hematology diagnostic
assessment. Table 1-1 offers some general questions for evaluation of a hematologic
disorder.
Physical Exam

20

The physical exam is also an important part of the diagnostic process. Along
with the history, it can suggest a diagnosis, guide lab testing, and aid in the
differential diagnosis. Table 1-2 offers some general physical exam findings that are
useful in the hematology patient.
Diagnostic Testing
Laboratories

The clinician should be comfortable using the complete blood count (CBC) and
peripheral smear to evaluate patients for possible hematologic disorders. Patients
may be referred to a hematologist based on a lab abnormality that is drawn for a
reason other than the diagnosis of a primary hematologic disorder. There are certain
limiting values in hematology that can help exclude or confirm the need for further
testing or warn us of the possibility of potential physiological consequences (see
Table 1-3).
The Peripheral Smear. The visual study of peripheral blood is
necessary to diagnose hematologic and nonhematologic diseases, for
example, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura or malaria. In these
cases, as in others, automated hematology analyzers are able to provide
a large number of data regarding all the blood cells but will not be able
to detect subtle anomalies critical in the diagnosis.

21

Slides for a peripheral smear are typically prepared either by automated
methods or by qualified technicians in a specialized laboratory. This step is critical
since poorly processed samples can lead to incorrect diagnoses. Smears may be
prepared on glass slides or coverslips. Ideally, blood smears should be prepared
from uncoagulated blood and from a sample collected from a finger stick. In
practice, most slides are prepared from blood samples containing anticoagulants and
are thus prone to the introduction of morphologic artifacts. Blood smears are
normally stained using Wright or May–Grünwald–Giemsa stain.

22

Examination of the Peripheral Smear. Examination of the smear
should proceed systematically and begin under low power to identify a
portion of the slide with optimal cellular distribution and staining, which
normally corresponds to the thinner edge of the sample. As a general
rule, the analysis starts with RBCs, continues with leukocytes,
and finishes with platelets. Under low power (×10 to ×20) it is
possible to analyze general characteristics of RBCs to discover, for
example, the presence of Rouleaux associated with multiple myeloma,
estimate the WBC and platelet counts, and determine the presence of
abnormal populations of cells, such as blasts, by scanning over the entire
23

smear. Under high power (×100), each of the cell lineages is examined
for any abnormalities in number or morphology.
Red Blood Cells. Quantitative analysis of RBCs is difficult on a
peripheral smear. Automated analyzers are used to calculate:
MCHC, the mean cell Hgb concentration, expressed as grams per
deciliter;
MCH, the mean corpuscular Hgb, expressed as picograms; and
MCV, the mean corpuscular volume, expressed as femtoliters (10−15 L).

Qualitative analysis of RBCs should demonstrate uniform round cells with
smooth membranes and a pale central area with a round rim of red Hgb. Variations
24

in size are called anisocytosis, and variations in shape, poikilocytosis. The
following abnormalities may be observed:
Hypochromia corresponds to a very thin rim of Hgb and a larger
central pale area. These red cells are often microcytic and are seen in
iron deficiency, thalassemias, and sideroblastic anemia.
Microcytosis (<6 μm): Differential diagnosis includes iron-deficiency
anemia, anemia in chronic disease, thalassemias, and sideroblastic
anemia. These cells are usually hypochromic and have prominent central
pallor.
Macrocytosis (>9 μm in diameter): Differential diagnosis includes liver
disease, alcoholism, aplastic anemia, and myelodysplasia. Megaloblastic
anemias (B12 and folate deficiencies) have macro-ovalocytes (large oval
c e l l s ) . Reticulocytes
are
large
immature
red
cells
with
polychromatophilia.
Schistocytes (fragmented cells) are caused by mechanical disruption of
cells in the microvasculature by fibrin strands or by mechanical prosthetic
heart valves. Differential diagnosis includes thrombotic thrombocytopenic
purpura/hemolytic uremic syndrome, disseminated intravascular
coagulation, hemolysis/elevated liver enzymes/low platelet count
(HELLP) syndrome, and malignant hypertension.
Acanthocytes (spiculated cells with irregular projections of varying
length) are seen in liver disease.
Burr cells (cells with short, evenly spaced cytoplasmic projections) may
be an artifact of slide preparation or found in renal failure and uremia.
Bite cells (cells with a smooth semicircle extracted) are due to spleen
phagocytes that have removed Heinz bodies consisting of denatured
Hgb. They are found in hemolytic anemia due to glucose-6-phosphate
dehydrogenase deficiency.
Spherocytes (round, dense cells with absent central pallor) are seen in
immune hemolytic anemia and hereditary spherocytosis.
Sickle cells (sickle-shaped cells) are due to polymerization of Hgb They
are found in sickle cell disease but not in sickle cell trait.
Target cells (cells with extra Hgb in the center surrounded by a rim of
pallor; bull’s-eye appearance) are due to an increase in the ratio of cell
membrane surface area to Hgb volume within the cell. These have a
central spot of Hgb surrounded by a ring of pallor from the redundancy in
cell membrane. They are found in liver disease, postsplenectomy, in
25

hemoglobinopathies, and in thalassemia.
Teardrop cells/dacryocytes (teardrop-shaped cells) are found in
myelofibrosis and myelophthisic states of marrow infiltration.
Ovalocytes (elliptical cells) are due to the abnormal membrane
cytoskeleton found in hereditary elliptocytosis.
Polychromatophilia (blue hue of cytoplasm) is due to the presence of
RNA and ribosomes in reticulocytes.
Howell–Jolly bodies (small, single, purple cytoplasmic inclusions)
represent nuclear remnant DNA and are found after splenectomy or with
functional asplenism.
Basophilic stippling (dark-purple inclusions, usually multiple) arises
from precipitated RNA found in lead poisoning and thalassemia.
Nucleated red cells are not normally found in peripheral blood. They
appear in hypoxemia and myelofibrosis or other myelophthisic
conditions, as well as with severe hemolysis.
Heinz bodies (inclusions seen only on staining with violet crystal)
represent denatured Hgb and are found in glucose-6-phosphate
dehydrogenase after oxidative stress.
Parasites, including malaria and babesiosis, may be seen within red
cells.
Rouleaux (red cell aggregates resembling a stack of coins) is due to
the loss of normal electrostatic charge–repelling red cells due to coating
with abnormal paraprotein, such as in multiple myeloma.
Leukoerythroblastic smear (teardrop cells, nucleated red cells, and
immature white cells) is found in marrow infiltration or fibrosis
(myelophthisic conditions).
White Blood Cells. WBCs normally seen on the peripheral smear
include mature granulocytes (neutrophils, eosinophils, and basophils)
and mature agranulocytes (lymphocytes and monocytes). Under normal
conditions, immature myeloid and lymphoid cells are not seen and their
presence is related to conditions such as infections and hematologic
neoplasias.
Neutrophils. Neutrophils comprise 55% to 60% of total WBCs (1.8 ×
109 to 7.7 × 10 9/L). They have nuclei containing three or four lobes and
granular cytoplasm. The normal size is 10 to 15 μm. Hypersegmented
neutrophils contain more than five lobes and are found in megaloblastic
anemias. The cytoplasmic granules correspond to enzymes that are used
26

during the acute phase of inflammation. Increased prominence of
cytoplasmic granules is indicative of systemic infection or therapy with
growth factors and is known as toxic granulation. Neutrophils develop
from myeloblasts through promyelocyte, myelocyte, metamyelocyte, and
band forms and progress to mature neutrophils. Only mature neutrophils
and bands are normally found in peripheral blood. Metamyelocytes and
myelocytes may be found in pregnancy, infections, and leukemoid
reactions. The presence of less mature forms in the peripheral blood is
indicative of hematologic malignancy or myelophthisis.
Lymphocytes. Lymphocytes comprise 25% to 35% (1 × 10 9 to 4.8 ×
109/L, or thousands per cubic millimeter) of total WBCs. They contain a
dark, clumped nucleus and a scant rim of blue cytoplasm. The
differentiation of T and B cells using light microscopy is very difficult. The
normal size is 7 to 18 μm. Atypical (or reactive) lymphocytes seen
in viral infections contain more extensive, malleable cytoplasm that may
encompass surrounding red cells.
Eosinophils. Eosinophils comprise 0.5% to 4% of total WBCs (0.2
×109/L, or thousands per cubic millimeter). These are large cells
containing prominent red/orange granules and a bilobed nucleus. The
normal size is 10 to 15 μm. Increased numbers are found in parasitic
infections and allergic disorders.
Monocytes. Monocytes comprise 4% to 8% of total WBCs (0 to 0.3 ×
109/L, or thousands per cubic millimeter). These are the bigger
circulating cells with an eccentric U-shaped nucleus. They contain blue
cytoplasm and are the precursors of the mononuclear phagocyte system
(macrophages, osteoclasts, alveolar macrophages, Kupfer cells, and
microglia). The usual size is 12 to 20 μm.
Basophils. Basophils comprise 0.01% to 0.3% of total WBCs (0 to 0.1
×109/L, or thousands per cubic millimeter). Their cytoplasm contains
large dark-blue granules and a bilobed nucleus. They are involved in
inflammatory reactions and increased numbers are also seen in chronic
myeloid leukemia. As for eosinophils, the normal size is 10 to 15 μm.
WBC Abnormalities. Quantitative anomalies result in leukopenia and
leukocytosis. Main causes of leukopenia include bone marrow failure
(aplastic
anemia),
myelophthisis
(acute
leukemia),
drugs
(immunosuppressive drugs, propylthiouracil), and hypersplenism (portal
hypertension). Main causes of leukocytosis are infection, inflammation,
27

malignancies, and allergic reactions.
Pelger–Huet anomaly (neutrophils have a bilobed nucleus connected
by a thin strand and decreased granulation) is seen in myelodysplastic
syndromes.
Hypersegmented neutrophils (more than four nuclear lobes) are
found in megaloblastic anemias (vitamin B12 and folate deficiency).
Blast cells (myeloblasts or lymphoblasts; large cells with large nuclei
and prominent nucleoli) are seen in acute leukemia.
Auer rods (rodlike granules in blast cytoplasm) are pathognomonic for
acute myelogenous leukemia, especially acute promyelocytic leukemia
(M3).
Hairy cells (lymphoid cells with ragged cytoplasm) are seen in hairy cell
leukemia.
Sézary cells (atypical lymphoid cells with cerebriform nuclei) are seen
in cutaneous T cell lymphoma.
Platelets. Platelets appear as small (1- to 2-μm-diameter), purplish
cytoplasmic fragments without a nucleus, containing red/blue granules.
Derived from bone marrow giant cells called megakaryocytes, they are
involved in the cellular mechanisms of primary hemostasis leading to the
formation of blood clots. Normal counts are 150,000 to 400,000 per cubic
millimeter of peripheral blood. The number of platelets per high-power
field multiplied by 20,000 usually estimates the platelet count per
microliter. Alternatively, one should find 1 platelet for every 10 to 20 red
cells.
Numbers of platelets can decrease due to bone marrow disease
(myelophthisic bone marrow), consumption (disseminated intravascular
coagulation), or drugs. An increase in numbers can be seen in bone
marrow overproduction (myeloproliferative syndromes) or in a normal
response to massive bleeding. Pseudo-thrombocytopenia represents
clumping of platelets in blood samples collected in EDTA, resulting in
spuriously low platelet counts. This phenomenon can be avoided by
using citrate to anticoagulate blood samples sent for blood counts.
Diagnostic Procedures

Bone Marrow Evaluation. For many hematologic diseases that affect
the bone marrow, evaluation of the peripheral blood smear does not
provide sufficient information, and a direct examination of the bone
28

marrow is required to establish the diagnosis. The bone marrow biopsy
can be done at the bedside under local anesthesia alone or in
combination with low doses of anxiolytics or opioids. Despite advances in
the bone marrow biopsy and aspiration techniques, they are still
commonly considered painful procedures, but with expertise, they can be
performed safely and with minimal discomfort to the patient.
Indications and Contraindications. The most common indications for
bone marrow evaluation are workup of bone marrow malignancies;
staging of marrow involvement by metastatic tumors; assessment of
infectious diseases that may involve the bone marrow (i.e., HIV,
tuberculosis); determination of marrow damage in patients exposed to
radiation, drugs, and chemicals; and workup of metabolic storage
diseases. There are a few absolute contraindications for the procedure,
including infection, previous radiation therapy at the site of biopsy, and
poor patient cooperation. Thrombocytopenia is not a contraindication to
bone marrow biopsy, although it may be associated with more
procedure-related bleeding. Patients who have a coagulopathy require
factor replacement or withholding of anticoagulation to minimize
bleeding complications.
Technique. In adults, the most common places to do the procedure are
the posterior and anterior iliac crests. Other potential biopsy sites are
the sternum and tibia. The posterior iliac crest is the preferred site, as it
allows collection of both aspirate and biopsy specimens and is associated
with minimal morbidity or complications. Usually, a Jamshidi bone
marrow aspiration and biopsy needle is used. Additional aspirate is often
obtained for studies such as flow cytometry, cytogenetics, and cultures.
In some instances, marrow cannot be aspirated and only a biopsy is
obtained (a “dry tap”). This can be due to the technique or may signal
myelofibrosis or previous local radiotherapy. In such cases, touch
preparations of the biopsy can be made to allow for a cytologic exam.
The biopsy specimen is embedded in a buffered formaldehyde-based
fixation for further processing.
Complications. Bleeding at the site of puncture is the most common
complication. It is easily controlled with compression, but some
thrombocytopenic patients will require platelet transfusions. Other
uncommon complications are infections, tumor seeding in the needle
track, and needle breakage.
29

Bone Marrow Examination
The examination of the bone marrow aspirate begins under low power
to obtain an impression of overall cellularity, an initial scan for any
abnormal populations of cells or clumps of cells, and an evaluation of the
presence or absence of bone marrow spicules. Megakaryocytes are
normally seen under low power as large multinucleated cells. The overall
cellularity of the marrow is difficult to estimate from the aspirate
because of contamination with peripheral blood.
The myeloid-to-erythroid (M:E) ratio is also determined under low
power and is normally 3:1 to 4:1. The ratio is increased in chronic
myeloid leukemia due to an increase in granulocyte precursors and is
increased in pure red cell aplasia due to a decrease in red cell
precursors. The ratio is decreased in hemolytic disorders in which
increased erythroid precursors are present or in agranulocytic conditions
secondary to chemotherapeutic agents or other drugs.
Under high power, the aspirate should contain a variety of cells
representative of various stages of myeloid and erythroid maturation.
Myeloid cells progress from myeloblasts to promyelocytes, myelocytes,
metamyelocytes, band forms, and then mature neutrophils. As these
cells mature, their nuclear chromatin condenses, with a resultant
decrease in the nuclear-tocytoplasmic ratio. Their cytoplasm gradually
develops granules seen in mature neutrophils.
Erythroid precursors progress from proerythroblasts through varying
stages of normoblasts known as basophilic, chromatophilic, and
orthochromic. The nucleus gradually condenses, and the cytoplasm
gradually takes on the pinkish hue of Hgb found in mature red cells.
Bone marrow core biopsies are fixed in a buffered formaldehydebased solution and then embedded in paraffin or plastic. Biopsies are
used to assess the cellularity of the bone marrow and the presence of
neoplasias, infections, or fibrosis. Cellularity is estimated by observing
the ratio of hematopoietic cells to fat cells. Cellularity is usually 30% to
60% but typically declines with advancing age.
Abnormalities in the Bone Marrow Evaluation. Listed below are
some of the more common abnormal findings of the bone marrow.
Acute leukemia: The presence of >20% blasts in the bone marrow
establishes the diagnosis of acute leukemia.
Myelodysplastic syndrome is a heterogeneous group of diseases
30

characterized by the presence of immature erythroid precursors with loss
of synchrony between nuclear and cytoplasmic maturation. Mature
myeloid cells have decreased lobes (Pelger–Huet cells). Iron staining
may reveal ring sideroblasts with iron granules surrounding the nucleus.
Chronic myeloid leukemia: Findings include a hypercellular marrow
with an increased M:E ratio. Myeloblasts represent <5% of cells, with
the marrow containing predominantly myelocytes, metamyelocytes, and
mature neutrophils.
Chronic lymphocytic leukemia is marked by hypercellular marrow
with small, round, mature lymphocytes with a thin rim of blue cytoplasm.
Myelofibrosis is often the cause of a “dry tap.” Bone marrow biopsy
will reveal marrow infiltration with collagen and fibrous tissue.
Essential thrombocytosis: Megakaryocyte hyperplasia is a common
finding.
Polycythemia vera is characterized by a hypercellular marrow.
Multiple myeloma: The marrow is replaced by large numbers of
abnormal, often immature plasma cells with eccentric nuclei containing a
cartwheel pattern of nuclear chromatin. Flame cells contain pink,
flamelike cytoplasm and are associated with an IgA paraprotein.
Megaloblastic anemia: Findings include hypercellular marrow with
abnormalities in myeloid and erythroid precursors. Megaloblasts are
erythroid cells that are larger than normal, with more nuclear chromatin.
There is loss of synchrony between nuclear and cytoplasmic maturation.
Storage diseases: Patients with Gaucher disease may have
macrophages with striated cytoplasm due to accumulation of
cerebrosides. Individuals with Niemann–Pick disease may have
macrophages with a foamy cytoplasm secondary to contained
sphingomyelin.

LEUKOPENIA

General Principles

The normal white blood cell (WBC) count varies with gender and
ethnicity but, in general, ranges from 4 × 109 to 11 × 109 cells/L (Table
2-1) and is composed of those cells committed to the leukocyte lineage:
granulocytes (neutrophils, eosinophils, and basophils), monocytes, and
lymphocytes. Neutrophils make up about 60% of the peripheral blood
nucleated cells. A person’s gender and ethnic background should be
taken into consideration when determining normal ranges.
Leukopenia is defined as a WBC count <3.8 × 109 cells/L. This
lower limit of normal varies with age (infants have lower absolute
neutrophil counts [ANCs] than adults) and race (lower ANCs in persons of
African ancestry, West Indians, Arab Jordanian, and Yemenite Jews),1
and 5% of thenormal population may fall outside of the normal reference
range. Leukopenias can be divided according to clinically relevant cell
lineages: neutrophils and lymphocytes.
NEUTROPENIA

General Principles
Definition

32

The ANC is obtained by taking the percentage of neutrophils identified on a 100cell differential or by the Coulter counter and multiplying by the total WBC count.
Neutropenia is classified as mild (ANC, <1.5 × 109 to 1 × 109 /L), moderate (ANC,
1 × 109 to 0.5 × 109/L), or severe (ANC, <0.5 × 109 /L). Agranulocytosis is the
total absence of granulocytes.
Epidemiology

Neutropenia is five times more prevalent in African Americans than Caucasians.
Etiology

Causes of neutropenia in adults are reported in Table 2-2. Severe neutropenia
can be congenital or acquired. Congenital causes are usually suggested by family
history. Most cases of neutropenia are acquired and related to decreased granulocyte
production and, less often, increased destruction. Pseudo-neutropenia may be
obtained by analyzing blood several hours old and in the presence of
paraproteinemia and certain anticoagulants that can cause clumping. Lower ANCs
occur in African Americans as a result of defective release of neutrophils from the
marrow, a poor marrow reserve, or an increased marginated pool of neutrophils.2

33

Pathophysiology

Neutropenia results from decreased production, ineffective granulopoiesis,
increased margination to peripheral pools, or increased peripheral destruction.
Acquired neutropenias are usually a result of infection, toxins/drugs, or immune
disorders. Viral, parasitic, or bacterial infections may cause neutropenia, and this is
usually short lived. The underlying mechanism involves increased margination,
sequestration, and increased destruction by circulating antibodies. Drug and toxin
exposure usually follows a temporal course, with neutropenia developing after
continued drug exposure of days to months. The mechanism of drug-induced
34

neutropenia is either antibody-mediated or direct toxic effects on the marrow.
Certain drugs at higher risk of causing neutropenia are highlighted in Table 2-3.
Primary immune disorders mediate neutropenia through antibody-mediated
neutrophil destruction.
Diagnosis
Clinical Presentation

Neutropenia is often incidentally discovered on a complete blood count
(CBC) but may present with fever or infection. Signs of infection, such
as purulence, may be less evident, given the low neutrophil count. The
risk of infection is directly related to the degree and duration of
neutropenia. The risk of infection increases at an ANC <1 × 109/L, but
clinical symptoms usually do not become manifest until the ANC falls
below 0.5 × 109/L.3
The initial evaluation should include a complete history and physical
exam. The history should focus on systemic symptoms of infection,
recent exposures or new medications, history of neutropenia, and family
history of neutropenia. The physical exam may suggest the cause of
neutropenia, and attention should be paid to vital signs that would
suggest sepsis or infection, oral cavity exam for gingivitis or tooth
abscess, macroglossia to suggest vitamin deficiency, lymphadenopathy
to suggest malignancy or infection, skin and joint changes suggesting a
rheumatologic disorder, and splenomegaly (sequestration and Felty’s
syndrome).
Diagnostic Testing

Initial laboratory evaluation starts with the CBC with complete differential and
review of the peripheral blood smear. Additional testing to consider includes
nutritional studies of vitamin B12, folate, and possibly copper. If a clonal process is
suspected, lymphocyte immunophenotyping by flow cytometry and T-cell receptor
gene rearrangement studies may be useful. Antinuclear antibody and antineutrophil
antibody testing can be sent to evaluate for autoimmune neutropenia. HIV and EBV
serologies start the initial infectious workup. If anemia or thrombocytopenia occurs
in combination with neutropenia, direct examination of the bone marrow via bone
marrow biopsy is usually warranted unless a cause is obvious. In cases of
asymptomatic mild neutropenia, serial CBC examination to rule out cyclic
35

neutropenia may be considered. In mild cases of neutropenia that do not improve in a
couple of months with observation, a bone marrow biopsy should be considered.
Treatment

Treatment is guided by the underlying etiology and severity of
neutropenia. This can range from close observation in patients with
benign neutropenia to growth factor support and antibiotics in patients
with neutropenic fevers.

36

Growth factors can be used to speed count recovery in drug-induced
neutropenia. The major complication associated with neutropenia is
infection.
Supportive care with broad-spectrum antibiotics in the ill or febrile
patient is an essential part of initial care while the workup for a cause of
neutropenia is under way. Common sites of infection include mucous
membranes, skin, perirectal and genital areas, bloodstream, and lungs.
Most commonly, endogenous bacterial flora is the pathogen
(Staphylococcus from skin or gram-negative organisms from the gut).
Antibiotics should be continued until the ANC is >500/L for 2 days and
the fever subsides. If fever and neutropenia persist, empiric antifungal
coverage should be considered.
Cases caused by drug toxicity should improve, with removal of the drug
within 1 to 3 weeks. Drug-related neutropenia can be confirmed by
testing antineutrophil-associated drug antibodies. Infectious etiologies
resolve with treatment of the infection or shortly after a viral infection
has subsided. Autoimmune diseases can be treated by
immunosuppression with corticosteroids and can be confirmed by testing
antineutrophil antibodies. Congenital etiologies are often supported with
growth factors such as granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF).
The involvement of other blood cell lineages (RBCs and platelets)
suggests aplastic anemia, leukemia, myelodysplastic syndromes, or
megaloblastic anemia.
LYMPHOPENIA

General Principles
Definition

Lymphopenia is defined as an absolute lymphocyte count <1.2 109/L. The
absolute lymphocyte count is 80% T cells and 20% B cells. Sixty-six percent of the
T-cell population is CD4+ cells and the remaining is mainly CD8+ cells.
Etiology

Lymphopenia is most often acquired, but congenital causes should also be
37

considered. Etiologies of lymphopenia are listed in Table 2-4 and are mainly
acquired. Patients who appear to have low or absent CD4 cells should be evaluated
for OKT4 epitope deficiency. This condition is found in 8% of individuals of
African descent. Individuals with OKT4 epitope deficiency usually have normal
CD4+ number and do not develop infections.4
Treatment

Most causes of lymphocytopenia are acquired, and the management focuses on
treating the underlying illness. The most common infectious cause is acquired
immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Other viral and bacterial diseases also cause
lymphocytopenia, which usually resolves a couple of weeks after antimicrobial
therapy. Zinc deficiency responds to repletion of zinc and should be part of the
initial screen, along with examination of the peripheral blood smear. Inherited
causes predispose to recurrent and opportunistic infections, and detailed discussion
of management is beyond the scope of this text. In general, prophylactic antibiotics
can be used, as well as best supportive care.
LEUKOCYTOSIS

General Principles

An elevated WBC most commonly reflects a normal bone marrow response to
inflammation or infection. Occasionally leukemia or myeloproliferative disorders
are to blame. The maturation of WBCs is influenced by G-CSFs, interleukins (ILs),
tumor necrosis factor, and complement components.
Definition

Leukocytosis is defined as a WBC count >10 × 109 cells/L.

38

Classification

Leukocytosis should be divided into granulocytosis, monocytosis, and
lymphocytosis to guide the workup and differential diagnosis.
Etiology

Most cases of leukocytosis are a result of the bone marrow reacting to
inflammation or infection. A leukemoid reaction is an excessive WBC response
(usually >50,000) associated with a cause outside of the bone marrow (growth
39

factors, infection, or differentiating agents such as all-trans retinoic acid [ATRA]).
Leukocytosis may also be caused by physical and emotional stress and usually
resolves in hours once the stress is eliminated. In postsplenectomy patients, a
transient leukocytosis can be seen, lasting for weeks to months secondary to the
demargination of leukocytes typically stored in the spleen. Other etiologies include
medications, but leukocytes should not rise above 20,000 to 30,000 in this case. The
leukocytosis seen in hemolytic anemias (sickle cell and autoimmune types) is related
to the nonspecific effects of increased erythropoiesis and inflammation.
Nonhematopoietic malignancy can also cause a leukocytosis that is multifactorial in
etiology. Finally, acute and chronic leukemias and myeloproliferative disorders
usually present with a leukocytosis.

Pathophysiology

The pathophysiology of leukocytosis stems from the production, maturation, and
survival of leukocytes. Stem cells give rise to erythroblasts, myeloblasts, and
megakaryoblasts. Seventy-five percent of nucleated cells in the bone marrow are
committed to production of leukocytes. At any given time, 90% of WBCs remain in
storage in the bone marrow, with 7% to 8% in the tissue compartment and the
remainder in circulation. This large storage pool allows for a rapid increase in
WBCs (mostly neutrophils). In addition, a percentage of circulating WBCs is
40

marginated along blood vessel walls and is mobilized by inflammatory stimuli. The
two basic causes of leukocytosis are a normal bone marrow response to external
stimuli or the effect of a primary bone marrow disorder.
Diagnosis

The differential diagnosis of leukocytosis is extensive, and common causes are
listed in Table 2-5. Increases in the absolute numbers of lymphocytes, eosinophils,
monocytes, or basophils are less common in leukocytosis than neutrophilia and help
to direct the differential diagnosis.
NEUTROPHILIA

General Principles
Definition

Neutrophilia is defined as an ANC >6.6 × 109/L. The neutrophil count is
influenced by shifts in neutrophils among four major compartments: the bone
marrow, the circulation, the marginated pool, and the tissues. Only about 5% of
neutrophils are in circulation at any given time, with a half-life of 6 to 10 hours.
Most neutrophils and their precursors are contained in storage pools in the bone
marrow at 10 to 20 times their circulating numbers. About 50% of peripheral blood
neutrophils are circulating, and the other 50% marginated along vessel walls and in
the spleen. This pool can be rapidly increased, within hours from the bone marrow
stores or within minutes from demarginating neutrophils along blood vessel walls.
Neutrophils move to sites of inflammation and infection and act as phagocytes. Their
trafficking depends on chemotaxins and surface molecules such as selectins to
mediate rolling and integrins to mediate adhesion and transmigration of blood
vessels.
Pathophysiology

The pathophysiology of primary neutrophilia may be related to inherited
deficiencies in adhesion molecules or, in the case of myeloproliferative disorders,
constitutive expression and activation of a growth-promoting receptor tyrosine
kinase such as bcr/abl or Jak2. Secondary neutrophilia, seen in infection and
inflammation, is related to demargination from storage pools in the bone marrow and
peripheral blood signaled by endotoxin and proinflammatory cytokines such as
41

tumor necrosis factor-alpha, IL-6, IL-1B, IL-8, G-CSF, and granulocyte/macrophage
colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF).
Diagnosis
Differential Diagnosis

Neutrophilia can be spurious, of primary hematologic origin, or related to
secondary causes. Etiologies of neutrophilia are listed in Table 2-6.
Spurious leukocytosis can be a result of the automated cell counter
(Coulter counter) counting clumps of platelets as leukocytes and is
usually associated with pseudo-thrombocytopenia. In addition,
cryoglobulins can agglutinate and be counted as leukocytes at
temperatures lower than body temperature.

Primary causes of neutrophilia may be hereditary (usually resulting in
splenomegaly and leukocyte counts of 20 × 109 to 100 × 109/L) or
associated with familial syndromes. Other primary causes include
42

myeloproliferative disorders (e.g., chronic myeloid leukemia [CML]) and
leukocyte adhesion deficiency.
Secondary causes are by far the most common cause of neutrophilia.
Common secondary causes include infection, smoking (25% increase),
chronic inflammation (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel
disease), stress, medications, chronic marrow stimulation (hemolytic
anemia and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura), asplenia, marrow
invasion, and nonhematologic malignancy.
Diagnostic Testing

Initial laboratory evaluation starts with review of the peripheral blood smear to
confirm automated counts and rule out spurious leukocytosis. The smear may suggest
a secondary cause such as infection or inflammation with increased bands,
vacuolization, Döhle bodies, and toxic granulations in neutrophils. A marrowinfiltrating process is suggested by a leukoerythroblastic reaction that shows a “left
shift” (increased myelocytes and metamyelocytes in the marrow and bands in the
peripheral blood) and nucleated RBCs. Acute leukemia is suggested by circulating
blasts, which may be incorrectly counted as monocytes or neutrophils by the Coulter
counter. If no secondary causes of neutrophilia can be identified, peripheral blood
analysis for bcr/abl by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) or cytogenetics
may be helpful to exclude CML. A leukocyte alkaline phosphatase (LAP) score is
of historical importance but is no longer commonly used because of intraoperator
variability and the evolution of cytogenetic testing. A low LAP score can be seen in
CML, and a high LAP score may suggest inflammation or infection.
Treatment

Treatment depends on the underlying etiology. Treatment of primary etiologies
such as CML and myeloproliferative disorders are discussed elsewhere in this book.
Treatment of neutrophilia related to a secondary cause revolves around treating the
underlying cause.
EOSINOPHILIA

General Principles

Eosinophilia is defined as an absolute eosinophil count >0.5 × 109/L.
43

Eosinophilia is most commonly due to secondary causes. Table 2-7 reviews causes
of eosinophilia. Absolute eosinophil counts >4 × 109/L suggest primary eosinophilia
as a result of either clonal expansion (chronic leukemia variant or acute leukemia
variant) or hypereosinophilic syndrome.5
Diagnosis

Initial evaluation of eosinophilia should include review of the peripheral
smear, stool examination for ova and parasites, and serum tryptase, cortisol, IgE,
and IL-5 levels. If no secondary source can be identified, T-cell
immunophenotyping and T-cell receptor gene rearrangement analysis and bone
marrow biopsy with cytogenetic analysis and FISH for the platelet-derived growth
factor receptor-alpha (FIP1L1-PDGFRA) rearrangement and bcr/abl should be
performed to evaluate for a clonal disorder.

Treatment

44

Hypereosinophilic syndrome can cause end organ damage, including cardiac
involvement causing conduction defects and cardiomyopathy, as well as pulmonary
involvement. In patients with evidence of end organ damage, treatment with
corticosteroids and hydroxyurea may be needed to decrease the eosinophil count
rapidly. Leukopheresis may be used as well to lower the eosinophil count rapidly.
Recent evidence suggests that patients with idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome
and chronic eosinophilic leukemia with the FIP1L1-PDGFRA rearrangement may be
effectively treated with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib.6
BASOPHILIA

General Principles
Definition

Basophilia is defined as an absolute basophil count >0.2 × 109/L. Basophils
are inflammatory mediators, and their granules contain histamine,
glycosaminoglycans, major basic protein, proteases, and other inflammatory and
vasoactive substances. They primarily function to activate the type 1 hypersensitivity
reaction mediated through surface receptors for IgE.
Etiology

Basophilia can be associated with hypersensitivity reactions to drugs and food.
It may also be seen in chronic inflammatory states such as tuberculosis and
ulcerative colitis. However, these reactions are rare, and the most common setting of
basophilia is in myeloproliferative disorders such as CML.
Diagnosis

Review of the peripheral smear confirms basophilia and management focuses on
the underlying etiology. Peripheral blood can be sent for Jak2 and bcr/abl to
evaluate for a myeloproliferative disorder. If suspicion of a myeloproliferative
disorder is high, a bone marrow biopsy is necessary.
MONOCYTOSIS

45

General Principles
Definition

Monocytosis is defined as an absolute monocyte count >0.8 × 109/L.
Monocytes are cells in transit to the tissues and are capable of transformation to
macrophages in the tissues. They play a role in acute and chronic inflammatory
reactions.
Etiology

Monocytosis usually represents a myeloproliferative disorder such as CML or
acute monocytic leukemia. Secondary causes include infection (bacterial or
tuberculosis) and relative monocytosis as seen with initial count recovery after
chemotherapy and drug-induced neutropenia.
Diagnosis

Review of the peripheral smear confirms monocytosis, and treatment is focused
on the underlying etiology. Peripheral blood can be sent for Jak2 and bcr/abl to
evaluate for a myeloproliferative disorder. If suspicion of a myeloproliferative
disorder is high, a bone marrow biopsy is necessary.
LYMPHOCYTOSIS

General Principles

Lymphocytosis is defined as an absolute lymphocyte count >3.3 × 109/L.
Lymphocytosis may be of primary or secondary origin. Table 2-8 reviews causes of
lymphocytosis. Cell surface markers are important in determining primary from
secondary lymphocytosis.
Diagnosis

The blood smear should be reviewed to look for evidence of reactive
lymphocytes associated with infection, large granular lymphocytes associated with
large granular lymphocytic leukemia, smudge cells associated with chronic
lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), or blasts associated with acute leukemia. Peripheral
blood flow cytometry immunophenotyping allows identification of clonal
46

disorders. Immunoglobulin or T-cell receptor gene rearrangements support a clonal
disorder.
Treatment

Management of hematological malignancies including CLL is discussed in
Chapter 29. Resolution of infectious etiologies results in resolution of the
lymphocytosis. Finally, removal of allergens such as drugs or venom results in
resolution of the lymphocytosis associated with hypersensitivity reactions.

ANEMIA

GENERAL PRINCIPLES

Definition

Anemia is defined as a decrease in circulating RBC mass, the usual criteria
being an Hgb <12 g/dL or Hct <36% for women and an Hgb <14 g/dL or Hct <41%
for men. Anemia is commonly encountered in inpatient medicine and thus a frequent
reason for hematology consults. A systematic approach to anemia is best at
narrowing down the diagnosis and guiding the subsequent diagnostic workup.
Etiology

While there can be some overlap, anemia can be divided into three broad
categories: blood loss (acute or chronic), increased destruction of RBCs
(hemolysis), and decreased production of RBCs. Blood loss can be evaluated by a
careful evaluation of the patient, including volume status. The reticulocyte count will
usually help differentiate between states with decreased production (reticulocyte
index [RI] <2%; see below for description of RI) and those associated with
increased destruction (implied when the RI is >2%).
DIAGNOSIS

49

Clinical Presentation
History

As with any other medical condition, the history and physical exam play key
roles in approaching anemia. Based on symptomatology, one can discern the time
line (acute, subacute, or chronic), the severity, and even the underlying etiology.
Patients can be asymptomatic, but those patients with an Hgb <7 g/dL will usually
have symptoms. Acute clinical manifestations include those typical of hypovolemia
(pallor, visual impairment, syncope, hypotension, and tachycardia) and require
immediate attention. Chronic symptoms will reflect tissue hypoxia (fatigue,
headache, dyspnea, lightheadedness, and angina). In addition to the usual symptoms
of anemia, iron deficiency is often associated with pica (consumption of nonfood
substances such as corn starch or ice). A careful history of the clinical
manifestations including initial presentation, time of onset, potential source of blood
loss, family history, and medication history must be evaluated carefully.
Physical Exam

On exam, one can note pallor, alopecia, atrophic glossitis, angular cheilosis,
congestive heart failure (with severe and chronic anemia), koilonychias (spoon
nails), Plummer-Vinson or Patterson-Kelly syndrome (dysphagia, esophageal web,
and atrophic glossitis with iron dficiency anemia), blue sclera, and brittle nails, as
well as hypotension and tachycardia.
Diagnostic Testing

The complete blood count (CBC) measures WBCs, Hgb, Hct, platelets,
as well as measures of the red cell indices. The Hgb is a measurement of
mass of Hgb in blood (grams per deciliter), whereas the Hct is the
physical amount of space that the Hgb occupies as a percentage of the
whole that the red cells occupy. Remember that the Hgb and Hct are
unreliable indicators of red cell volume in the setting of rapid shifts of
intravascular volume (i.e., acute bleeding).
The most useful red cell indices include the mean corpuscular
volume(MCV), red cell distribution width (RDW), and mean cell
Hgb concentration (MCHC). MCV is the mean size of the red cells and
the normal range is 80 to 100 fL. RBCs can be classi fied as microcytic
when the MCV is <80 fL and macrocytic when it is >100 fL. RDW is a
50

measure of variability in the size of the red cells and is calculated as:
RDW = (standard deviation of red cell volume ÷ mean cell volume) ×
100. An elevated RDW indicates increased variability in RBC size. The
MCHC describes the concentration of Hgb in each cell.
The reticulocyte count measures the immature red cells in the blood
as a percentage of the whole and reflects the bone marrow's (BM's)
response to anemia (i.e., a normal BM response is to increase the
production of red cells in anemia so that the observed reticulocyte count
goes up). A nascent RBC lives on average for 120 days, and the BM is
constantly replenishing the bloodstream with new RBCs, with the normal
reticulocyte count bein ~1%. In the setting of anemia or blood loss, the
BM should increase its production of RBC in proportion to loss of RBC,
and thus a 1% reticulocyte count in the setting of anemia is
inappropriate. The RI is calculated as percentage reticulocytes × (actual
Hct/ normal Hct) and is important in determining if a patient's BM is
responding appropriately to the level of anemia. In normal individuals,
an RI of 1.0 to 2.0 is acceptable; however, an RI of <2 with anemia
indicates decreased production of RBCs. An RI of >2 with anemia may
indicate hemolysis or loss of RBC leading to increased compensatory
production of reticulocytes.
The peripheral smear is a required part of the initial hematologic
evaluation. Shapes, size, and orientation of cells in relation to each other
are important factors to look for in a smear. RBCs can appear in many
abnormal forms, such as acanthocytes, schistocytes, spherocytes, and
teardrop cells, and abnormal orientations such as rouleaux formation.
A bone marrow biopsy may be indicated in cases of normocytic
anemias with a low RI without an identifiable cause or anemia
associated with other cytopenias. The biopsy may confirm myelophthisic
process (i.e., presence of teardrop or fragmented cells, normoblasts, or
immature WBCs on peripheral blood smear)in the setting of
pancytopenias.

ANEMIAS ASSOCIATED WITH DECREASED PRODUCTION
The approach to an anemia associated with decreased production of red cells is
to divide them into categories based on red cell size with the MCV. Depending on
the MCV, microcytic (<80 fL), normocytic (80 to 100 fL), and macrocytic (>100
51

fL) anemias have distinct differential diagnoses.

MICROCYTIC ANEMIAS
Iron-deficiency anemia, sideroblastic anemia, and anemia of chronic disease
make up the bulk of the microcytic anemias. The degree of microcytosis may give a
clue to the possible underlying diagnoses. A very low MCV typically does not
represent anemia of chronic disease or sideroblastic anemia (Table 3-1).
Iron-Deficiency Anemia
Etiology

Iron-deficiency anemia can be caused by decreased intake/absorption of
iron or loss of iron from chronic blood loss. Dietary deficiency is
usually seen in infants who are milk-fed. In early childhood, it can be
seen in meat-deficient diets. It can also occur in the setting of increased
requirements, such as pregnancy and early childhood. Malabsorption of
iron can occur in the setting of partial gastrectomy, as
hypochlorhydria/achlorhydria impairs iron absorption. Iron is most
actively absorbed in the duodenum. Decreased transit time through
duodenum, as seen in chronic diarrhea, may result in iron deficiency.
Gastrointestinal causes for iron deficiency (e.g., atrophic gastritis,
Helicobacter pylori gastritis, celiac disease) should be considered in
patients with otherwise unexplained iron dficiency, especially when there
is refractoriness to oral iron therapy.1
Chronic blood loss is the most common cause of iron deficiency in
adults. It is usually lost via the GI tract by ulcerative disease, gastritis,
52

cancer, hemorrhoids, or arteriovenous malformation, with ulcers and
colon malignancies being the most common. Menorrhagia/menstruation,
hematuria due to genitourinary cancer, frequent blood donation, and
frequent phlebotomy in hospitalized patients are additional causes of
chronic blood loss. It should be noted that the diagnosis of iron
deficiency in an adult mandates evaluation for GI malignancy.
Diagnosis

Diagnosis involves serum testing of iron with an iron panel and ferritin level.
The iron panel includes serum iron level, total iron binding capacity (TIBC),
unsaturated iron binding capacity (UIBC), and transferrin saturation (Tsat).
Serum iron levels reflect the level of iron immediately available for blood
production. TIBC is an indirect method of determining the transferrin
level in serum. Transferrin is an iron-transporting protein that is capable
of associating reversibly with up to 1.254 g of iron per 1 g of protein. In
one series, a transferrin saturation less than 15% was 80% sensitive as
an indicator of iron dficiency, but only 50% to 65% specific.
Serum ferritin (intracellular iron storage protein) should also be
checked and, when low, almost always signifies iron deficiency. Virtually
all patients with serum ferritin concentrations less than 10 to 15 ng/mL
are iron deficient, with a sensitivity of 59% and a specificity of 99%.2
However, it is an acute phase reactant and can be falsely elevated in
inflammatory states. The effect of inflammation is to elevate serum
ferritin approximately threefold. A useful rule of thumb in such patients is
to divide the patient's serum ferritin concentration by 3; a resulting value
of 20 or less suggests concomitant iron deficiency.
Serum transferrin receptor (sTfR) provides a quantitative measure of
total erythropoietic activity, since its concentration in serum is directly
proportional to erythropoietic rate and inversely proportional to tissue
iron availability. Typically, in iron-deficiency anemia, the iron level is low,
the TIBC is in the normal to high range, sTfR is high, and ferritin is
depleted. The Tsat, the percentage of transferrin that is bound to iron,
can be a somewhat less reliable measure of iron. Low transferrin
saturation is associated with iron-deficiency states, while high saturation
is associated with excess iron. The gold standard for diagnosis of an irondeficiency anemia is a BM biopsy with iron staining; however, this is
rarely necessary.
53

Of note, patients can have microcytic normochromic (concentration of
Hgb in the erythrocytes is within the normal range of 32% to 36%)
anemia that eventually progresses to microcytic hypochromic as the
anemia progresses. With worsening iron-deficiency anemia, there is a
gradual increase in anisocytosis and poikilocytosis (abnormally shaped
cells).
Treatment

In addition to diagnosing the patient with iron-deficiency anemia, it is
important to discover and treat the underlying cause of the iron
deficiency, if possible. Iron replacement may be given by oral iron
salts, which should be given between meals because food or antacids
may decrease absorption. Ascorbic acid given with iron sulfate may
increase absorption. One replacement regimen is ferrous sulfate, 325 mg
PO tid (equivalent of 65 mg elemental iron tid). Enteric-coated forms are
not well absorbed and should not be used.
Parenteral iron is given when the patient is intolerant of oral iron,
when iron losses exceed the capacity to replete orally, or in the setting
of malabsorption. There is ~ 1 in 300 risks of a serious reaction including
anaphylaxis. The absolute risk for life-threatening adverse reactions for
iron sucrose, ferric gluconate complex, low MW dextran, and high MW
dextran is 0.6, 0.9, 3.3, and 11.3 per million doses, respectively.
The amount of Fe needed can be calculated as the amount of Fe needed
to replace the missing Hgb added to the amount necessary to replete
the total body Fe stores (usually estimated as approximately 1000 mg)
by the formula:
Total dose (mg) = {[normal Hgb(g/dL) — patient Hgb(g/dL)] × body weight
[kg] × 2.2)} + 1000 mg
However, in practice, iron is often infused at a dose of 1 to 1.2 g without formal
calculation of iron repletion.
One can expect an increase in the reticulocyte count within 7 to 10 days,
and correction of anemia usually occurs within 6 to 8 weeks if ongoing
blood loss is stopped. Treatment should continue for approximately 6
months (on PO iron) to fully restore tissue stores.
Sideroblastic Anemias

Sideroblastic anemias are characterized by ineffective erythropoiesis and the
54

presence of ringed sideroblasts in the BM. The term ringed refers to the
accumulation of iron in the mitochondria that surrounds the periphery of the nucleus.
There are hereditary and idiopathic forms, as well as forms associated with drugs or
toxins such as alcohol, lead, isoniazid (INH), zinc toxicity with resulting copper
deficiency, and chloramphenicol. There is no cure for hereditary sideroblastic
anemia, and treatment is aimed at preventing end-organ damage from iron overload
(chelation therapy). Drug-induced sideroblastic anemias are commonly reversible
when the offending agent is discontinued. For sideroblastic anemia caused by
isoniazid treatment, high-dose pyridoxine supplementation (up to 200 mg/d PO)
often reverses the anemia and allows for continuation of the drug.
Lead Poisoning

An additional diagnosis to consider in cases of microcytic, hypochromic
anemias is lead poisoning. This is a rare but treatable form of microcytic anemia in
adults and usually results from a work or an environmental exposure. The diagnosis
is suggested by finding basophilic stippling on the peripheral smear.
Anemia of Chronic Disease

Anemia of chronic disease usually presents as a normocytic anemia; however, it
can be microcytic (usually mild) in a minority of cases.
Thalassemias
Epidemiology

Beta-thalassemia is more common in Mediterranean, African, and Southeast
Asian populations and is thought to offer resistance to falciparum malaria.
Pathophysiology

The major hemoglobin in adults is hemoglobin A, a tetramer consisting
of one pair of alpha-globin chains and one pair of beta-globin chains. 3 In
normal subjects, globin chain synthesis is very tightly controlled, such
that the ratio of production of alpha to non-alpha chains is 1.00 ± 0.05.
Thalassemia refers to a spectrum of diseases characterized by reduced
or absent production of one or more globin chains, thus disrupting this
closely regulated ratio.
Beta-thalassemia major results from a total lack of production of
beta-globin chain. It causes lack of adequate Hgb A formation, leading to
55

microcytic, hypochromic cells. Complications of severe beta-thalassemia
include skeletal deformities resulting from erythropoietin-stimulated
expansion of BM, hepatosplenomegaly from extramedullary
hematopoiesis, and secondary hemochromatosis from repeat blood
transfusions and increased dietary absorption of iron.
Beta-thalassemia minor is loss of only one of the two alleles coding
for the beta-globulin gene. It is usually an asymptomatic condition
manifested by microcytosis and a normal red cell distribution width. It is
accompanied by a mild anemia (if any). On electrophoresis in patients
with beta-thalassemia minor, over 90% of the hemoglobin will be
hemoglobin A along with an elevation in the hemoglobin A2 value,
sometime as high as 7% or 8%, and an increase in hemoglobin F in
about 50% of patients.
Alpha-thalassemia results from decreased production of alpha-globin
chains, of which there are four in total. The severity of anemia depends
on the number of defective alpha genes. Hemoglobin H disease is due to
the loss of three of the four alpha-globin loci. Adult patients have
moderate degree of anemia, and their hemoglobin electrophoresis
pattern shows 5% to 30% hemoglobin H (beta-4 tetramers). Hydrops
fetalis with hemoglobin Barts (gamma-4 tetramers) is due to loss of all
four alpha-globin loci. This condition is incompatible with extrauterine
life. Diagnosis is by Hgb electrophoresis for beta-thalassemia and severe
alpha-thalassemia. Mild alpha-thalassemia may be detected by
alpha:beta ratio or by molecular testing, although neither is widely
available.
Treatment

The treatment of thalassemias usually depends on the severity of the genetic
defect and resultant clinical sequelae. The minor thalassemias are commonly
asymptomatic and require no therapy. The major thalassemias may be treated by
chronic transfusions, chelation therapy to avoid iron overload (due to transfusions),
and splenectomy. For ferritin concentrations >1000 ng/mL, chelation therapy may
reduce the long-term complications of iron overload. Options for chelation include
the intramuscular or subcutaneous iron chelator deferoxamine and oral iron chelator
deferasirox.
NORMOCYTIC ANEMIAS

56

Normocytic anemias can be associated with an elevated reticulocyte count,
which represents hemolytic anemia (HA) or bleeding, whereas a decreased
reticulocyte count typically represents a hypoproliferative disorder (Table 3-2).
Normocytic anemia may be an early finding in BM failure. Aplastic anemia is
actually a BM failure syndrome and is discussed in Chapter 8. Pure RBC aplasia
involves a selective destruction of RBC precursors and can be congenital or
acquired. It is often associated with viral infections (e.g., parvovirus). Symptoms
are related to the anemia. Diagnosis is via BM biopsy showing absence of erythroid
elements but with preservation of other cell lines. Treatment includes supportive
measures with transfusions as needed.

Anemia of Chronic Disease (Anemia of Chronic Inflammation)

This condition is often associated with malignancy, infection, and inflammatory
states. It may occur in patients with chronic infections (e.g., osteomyelitis), HIV, or
inflammatory diseases (e.g., lupus or rheumatoid arthritis). These disorders have in
common the inhibition of normal RBC synthesis due to the underlying disorder. They
may act by inadequate release of or insensitivity to erythropoietin. Other etiologies
include deficiency in mobilization of iron from the reticuloendothelial system. One
acute phase protein that appears to be most directly involved in iron metabolism is
hepcidin.4,5
57

The anemia is most often a normocytic, normochromic anemia with a decreased
reticulocyte count but may also present as a mild microcytic anemia. The serum iron
concentration and total iron-binding capacity are usually both low, often giving a
normal transferrin saturation (although this may be low or low-normal range). Serum
ferritin, however, is an acute phase reactant and is often elevated in inflammatory
diseases and infections. BM exam, if done, typically shows present iron stores.
Symptoms and physical exam of the anemia of chronic disease patient are dependent
on the patient's underlying condition. The anemia is typically mild and does not
require blood transfusion. The more appropriate treatment is to treat the underlying
condition.
Myelophthisic Anemias

Myelophthisic anemias refer to those with evidence of hematopoiesis outside the
BM or infiltration of the BM by nonhematologic cells. The most common cause is
metastatic carcinoma to the BM (e.g., breast, lung, prostate, and kidney). Other
causes include myeloproliferative disorders, multiple myeloma, leukemias, and
lymphoma. These are often suspected by a typical appearance of the peripheral
smear (nucleated RBC, teardrop-shaped RBCs, and immature WBCs) and a “dry
tap” on BM aspiration. BM biopsy results are dependent on the underlying disease.
Treatment is directed toward the underlying disorder.
Anemia of Chronic Renal Failure

Anemia of chronic renal failure is due to erythropoietin deficiency. The anemia
generally starts when CrCl <45 mL/min and worsens with declining renal
function. When possible, treatment involves first treating the underlying renal
dysfunction. Erythropoietin can be given at 50 to 100 U/kg IV or SC 3 × /wk, with
readjustments based on response. In follow-up, expect an increase in Hct in 8 to 12
weeks.
Endocrine Disorders

Anemia due to endocrine disorders is seen in hypothyroidism, adrenal
insufficiency, and gonadal dysfunction. Estrogens tend to inhibit red cell synthesis,
and testosterone tends to stimulate it. Correction of the underlying endocrine
disorder may improve the anemia.
MACROCYTIC ANEMIAS

58

Anemias that have an MCV of more tha ~100 fL are macrocytic anemias. These
may be separated into two categories based on features seen on peripheral smear:
megaloblastic and nonmegaloblastic. Megaloblastic features include the presence of
oval macrocytes and hypersegmentation of the PMNs. They are a consequence of
abnormal maturation of these cells and nuclear/cellular asynchrony. Examples of
megaloblastic anemia include vitamin B12 deficiency, folate deficiency, and druginduced megaloblastic anemia. Nonmegaloblastic features include the presence of
round macrocytes without hypersegmentation of the PMNs. Causes of
nonmegaloblastic macrocytic anemia include liver disease, hypothyroidism, alcoholinduced reticulocytosis and reticulocytosis secondary to HA, and myelodysplastic
syndrome (see Chap. 8 for further discussion).
Vitamin B12 Deficiency

The daily requirement of vitamin B12 is 2 μg/d, and a typical diet provides 5 to
15 μg/d, with the liver capable of storing ~2000 to 5000 μg. Thus, it takes up to 3 to
6 years for deficiency to develop once absorption completely ceases.
Etiology

Etiologies include pernicious anemia (the most common cause), gastrectomy or
gastric bypass surgery, ileal disorders (sprue, inflammatory bowel disease, and
lymphoma), bacterial overgrowth in the small intestine, fish tapeworms, and
inadequate intake (this is very rare and only occurs in the strict vegetarian).
Clinical Presentation

Symptoms include burning sensation of the tongue, vague abdominal pain,
diarrhea, numbness, paresthesia, and mental impairment. On exam, one can note
glossitis, smooth tongue, dorsal column findings (decreased vibration and
proprioception), and corticospinal tract findings (motor weakness, spasticity,
positive Babinski sign). Of note, patients can present with neurologic signs without
overt anemia.
Diagnostic Testing

In cases of borderline-low B12 values, one can measure serum methylmalonic
acid and homocysteine levels, which are elevated in vitamin B12 deficiency. Once
dficiency is established, an attempt should be made to identify the etiology. The
presence of anti-intrinsic factor antibodies or anti-parietal cell antibodies lends
59

support to the diagnosis of pernicious anemia. Surgical history can reveal
postsurgical etiologies. Suspicion of ileal disorder can be evaluated by endoscopy.
Stool ova and parasites should be performed if suspicious for parasitic infection. A
therapeutic trial of antibiotics may be given if bacterial overgrowth is suspected.
The Schilling test is rarely used today but may delineate the underlying pathology.
Treatment

Treatment usually includes vitamin B12, 1 mg IM or SC daily for 7 days, then
weekly for 1 month, followed by monthly doses thereafter. There are data suggesting
that oral vitamin B12 at doses of 1 to 2 mg daily is just as effective as IM
administration.6 Failure to correct or identify the underlying mechanism of
deficiency may result in lifelong therapy.
Monitoring/Follow-up

Reticulocytosis should occur in 5 to 7 days, with resolution of hematologic
abnormalities ~2 months. Resolution of neurologic abnormalities depends on their
duration before treatment and may take up to 18 months but can also be permanent.
Folate Deficiency

The daily requirement of folate is 50 to 100 μg/d, with body stores of ~5 to 10
mg. Depletion can occur after ~2 to 4 months of persistent negative balance.
Etiologies include inadequate intake (e.g., alcoholics), decreased absorption
(e.g., sprue, bacterial overgrowth, certain drugs such as phenytoin and oral
contraceptives), or states of increased requirements (HA, pregnancy, chronic
dialysis, exfoliative dermatitis). Folate deficiency can also be iatrogenic, such as
treatment with folic acid antagonists (e.g., methotrexate, trimethoprim).
Symptoms and physical exam are similar to vitamin B12 deficiency except that
neurologic features are not present. Both serum and RBC folate levels must be
measured. Serum folate is more labile and subject to acute rise after a folate-rich
meal; RBC folate is a better indicator of tissue stores.
It is important to rule out vitamin B12 deficiency before repletion with folate,
because folate may improve the hematologic abnormalities in vitamin B12 deficiency
but will not correct the neurologic manifestations.
Treatment is with oral folate (1 mg/d), with resolution of hematologic
abnormalities ~2 months.
Drug-Induced Disorders

60

Several drugs can cause a macrocytic anemia by affecting DNA synthesis.
Offenders include purine analogs (e.g., 6-mercaptopurine, azathioprine), pyrimidine
analogs (5-fluorouracil, cytarabine), hydroxyurea, and anticonvulsants (phenytoin,
phenobarbital). Reverse transcriptase inhibitors (AZT, etc.) may cause macrocytosis
without anemia. Therapy is cessation of the offending agent or toleration of a mild
anemia if the drug is therapeutically needed.
Nonmegaloblastic Anemia

Nonmegaloblastic anemias typically have round macrocytes without
hypersegmentation of PMNs on peripheral smear. MCV of nonmegaloblastic
anemias is rarely > 110 to 115. A value higher than this would tend to support a
megaloblastic etiology. When the reticulocyte count is elevated, it suggests an
etiology such as alcohol, hypothyroidism, or liver disease. HA can produce a
macrocytosis via increased production of reticulocytes. Nonmegaloblastic anemias
are usually treated by identifying and treating the underlying etiology, such as
discontinuation of alcohol use and thyroid hormone replacement.

ANEMIAS ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASED DESTRUCTION
Table 3-3 lists causes of anemia associated with increased RBC destruction.
Hemolytic anemias can be classified by the location of hemolysis or the mechanism
of hemolysis.
Location of Hemolysis

Extravascular— Cell destruction occurs in the reticuloendothelial system,
usually in the spleen.
Intravascular— RBC destruction takes place within the circulation.
Mechanism of Hemolysis

Intrinsic— Hemolysis is caused by a defect in the RBC membrane or
contents.
Extrinsic— Factors outside the RBC, such as serum antibody, trauma
within circulation, infection, etc., lead to RBC damage.
In general, most intrinsic causes are hereditary, and most extrinsic causes are
acquired.

61

Hemolytic Anemias
General Principles

Hemolytic anemias are disorders in which the destruction of RBCs leads to a
decrease in circulating RBC mass. Acute hemolysis may be accompanied by a
wide variety of signs and symptoms, many of which may point to the underlying
etiology.
Diagnosis

Patients may present with fever, chills, jaundice, back and abdominal pain,
splenomegaly, and brown or red urine. Peripheral blood smear remains a useful tool
both to confirm the diagnosis of hemolysis and to aid in discerning the underlying
etiology. Some signs commonly found on peripheral smears include spherocytes
(autoimmune HA, hereditary spherocytosis), helmet cells or schistocytes
(microangiopathic HA), sickle cells and Howell-Jolly bodies (sickle cell anemia),
spur cells (in liver diseases), bite cells or Heinz bodies (glucose-6-phosphate
dehydrogenase [G-6-PD] deficiency), and agglutination (cold agglutinin).
Laboratory abnormalities suggestive of hemolysis, though not specific, include
increased lactate dehydrogenase, decreased haptoglobin, and increased
unconjugated bilirubin. In addition, signs of compensatory increased RBC
production such as an increase in reticulocyte count are typically present. Other
useful lab tests include the direct Coombs test, which is a direct antiglobulin test
that detects antibodies (usually IgG) or complement (usually C3) bound to the
surface of circulating RBCs by mixing patient RBCs with anti-IgG. Positive results
62

occur when allo- or autoantibodies to RBC antigens are present, or when there is
nonspecific adherence of other Ig or immune complexes to the RBC surface. The
indirect Coombs test, which mixes the patient's serum with normal RBCs, is used to
detect the presence of any anti-RBC antibody in the serum.
Sickle Cell Anemia

Sickle cell anemia is caused by a defect in the beta-globin chain, resulting in
sickling of RBC under oxidative stress. See Chapter 11 for further details.
Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase Deficiency

G-6-PD deficiency is an X-linked disorder that is fully expressed in males and
homozygous females and variably expressed in heterozygous females. G-6-PD is the
rate-limiting enzyme in the pentose phosphate pathway that helps maintain intracellular levels of glutathione, which serves to protect RBC against oxidative
damage.
In patients with G-6-PD deficiency, the presence of oxidative stress results in an
inability to maintain Hgb in a reduced state, which, in turn, leads to Hgb
precipitation within RBCs (Heinz body formation) and intravascular hemolysis.
Two main variants of G-6-PD lead to clinically significant hemolysis: G-6-PD Aand G-6-PD Mediterranean. G-6-PD A-, which occurs in 10% of black individuals,
has normal enzyme activity in young RBCs but a marked deficiency of enzyme
activity in older cells. Therefore, when oxidatively challenged, only the older cells
lyse. This form is typically milder and self-limited. The G-6-PD Mediterranean
variant occurs in people of Middle Eastern and Mediterranean descent, and is
characterized by a nearly complete lack of G-6-PD. Hemolysis in this form tends to
be more severe compared to the A- variant.
The diagnosis of G-6-PD deficiency is suspected when hemolysis occurs after
any form of oxidative stress, most commonly from starting on drugs known to
precipitate hemolysis in a G-6-PD-deficient patient (Table 3-4). Other triggers of
hemolytic crises include certain foods, most notably fava beans, illnesses such as
severe infections, and diabetic ketoacidosis. Findings on the peripheral blood smear
suggestive of the diagnosis include Heinz bodies and “bite” cells. Heinz bodies are
Hgb precipitants in the RBC, while bite cells are deformed RBCs that result from
attempts by macrophages in the spleen to remove the Heinz bodies.
Definitive diagnosis is made by measuring G-6-PD enzyme activity level. In
suspected G-6-PD A2 variant, enzyme levels should not be measured during
acute hemolysis. In these patients, older RBCs containing the defective enzymes
63

have mostly been lysed during acute hemolysis, and the normal enzyme activities in
the remaining younger RBCs and reticulocytes will provide a false-negative result. It
is, therefore, advisable to wait 3 to 4 weeks after the acute episode to get a true
representation of the enzyme activity level. The same does not apply to the
Mediterranean variant, as both younger and older red cells are affected.
Treatment is supportive, with transfusions as needed, and preventive, with
avoidance of oxidative precipitant.
Hereditary Spherocytosis (Membrane Defect)

Hereditary spherocytosis is an autosomal dominant disorder most common in
patients of Northern European descent. In these patients, a defect in a membrane
cytoskeletal protein leads to loss of surface area on the RBCs, resulting in
spherocyte formation. Hemolysis of the spherocytic RBCs occurs primarily in the
spleen.

Clinical presentation may vary from asymptomatic to profound anemia and
jaundice, depending on the severity of spherocytosis. Some patients may present
with cholelithiasis. Splenomegaly is detected in most patients due to extravascular
hemolysis. Peripheral blood smears reveal spherocytes. The MCV is normal or
slightly low and is of little diagnostic value. However, considering the degree of
reticulocytosis, the MCV is actually low. In unsplenectomized children, for example,
elevations in MCHC (> 35 g/dL [normal 31.1–34 g/dL]) and RDW (> 14 [normal
mean 12.6]) have a sensitivity of 63% and specificity of 100% for the diagnosis of
HS, making these combined indices a powerful screening tool. 7 The osmotic
fragility test, which measures the RBC resistance to hemolysis when incubated in
hypotonic saline, will show increased hemolysis.
64

Treatment is largely supportive, with transfusions as needed and folate
supplement to support increased erythropoiesis. Splenectomy, which corrects the
anemia but not the underlying defect, can be curative and may be considered in
patients with severe anemia.
Acquired Immune Hemolytic Anemia
Warm Antibody

Warm antibody is the most common form of autoimmune HA. The most common
antibodies involved are IgG and they are most active at 37 ? C. Sixty percent of
cases are idiopathic (or primary), whereas 40% are secondary. Secondary causes
include chronic lymphocytic leukemia, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, Hodgkin lymphoma,
auto-immune disorders (such as systemic lupus erythematosus), and drugs. Drugrelated antibodies can occur by three main mechanisms:
Autoantibody— Antibody against Rhesus (e.g., methyldopa) is produced.
Hapten— Drug binds to the RBC membrane, acting as hapten, which
serves as a target for antibodies. Hemolysis typically occurs 1 to 2 weeks
after treatment (e.g., penicillin, cephalosporins).
Immune complex— Drug binds to plasma protein, evoking an antibody
response. The drug-protein-antibody complex then nonspecifically coats
RBCs, resulting in complement-mediated lysis (e.g., quinidine, INH,
sulfonamides).
Warm antibodies usually cause extravascular hemolysis by the spleen, leading
to splenomegaly. Almost all are panagglutinins (i.e., react with most donor RBCs),
thus making crossmatching difficult. Treatment for drug-induced hemolysis is
withdrawal of the offending agent, as hemolysis will stop with clearance of the drug.
Steroids (prednisone) and immunoglobulins remain the most commonly used initial
therapies. Prednisone up to 1 mg/kg/d may be used for severe hemolysis in
idiopathic forms, until Hgb reaches normal levels over a few weeks, and then
tapered. Intravenous immunoglobulins may be effective in controlling hemolysis,
though its benefits tend to be short-lived. Splenectomy is an option for patients who
fail or relapse after steroid taper. If steroids and splenectomy both fail, other
immunosuppressives such as rituximab, cyclosporine, azathioprine, and
cyclophosphamide should be considered. Transfusions should be avoided, if
possible, as they may result in more hemolysis.
Cold Antibody

65

Most cold antibodies are IgM and active at <30°C. Acute onset is often
associated with infectious causes such as mycoplasma pneumonia and infectious
mononucleosis, whereas chronic forms occur with lymphoproliferative disorders or
are idiopathic.
The two main manifestations are acrocyanosis (ears, nose, and distal
extremities) and hemolysis (complement mediated). Symptoms mainly occur in distal
body parts, where the temperature often drops below 30°C. In these cold
temperatures, IgM will bind to the RBCs, leading to complement fiation and
hemolysis. The antibody dissociates from the RBCs as the temperature rises above
30°C. Hemolysis is not usually seen unless cold agglutinin titers are above 1 in
1000. Treatment mainly involves avoidance of cold exposure and treatment of the
underlying disorder. While certain immunosuppressive agents and plasmapheresis
may be effective, splenectomy and steroids are of limited therapeutic value.
Acquired Nonimmune Hemolytic Anemia

Acquired causes of nonimmune HA are often secondary to physical damages
from the environment, chemical changes, or infections. Microangiopathic and
macroangiopathic HAs represent the most common causes of environmental
damages. In these cases, changes in the vasculature result in the destruction of RBCs
due to physical stress. Conditions associated with these forms of HAs include
disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura
(TTP), hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS), prosthetic heart valves, and severe
aortic stenosis. DIC, TTP, and HUS are discussed in Chapter 4. Osmotic changes
and certain snake and spider venom are examples of chemical damages to RBCs.
HA is a characteristic feature of malarial infections. Table 3-5 lists the causes of
acquired nonimmune HA.

66

POLYCYTHEMIA
Secondary polycythemia refers to erythrocytosis, which is defined as increased
RBC mass. Chronic generalized or local hypoxia causes the body to respond by
producing RBC mass to compensate. Chronic hypoxia from congenital heart disease,
lung diseases including chronic obstructive lung disease and smoking with increased
carboxy-hemoglobin levels, or even local hypoxia to kidneys may increase
erythropoietin levels from the kidneys (appropriate or inappropriate), resulting in
increased production of RBCs. On physical exam, a ruddy complexion can be seen
in patients with secondary polycythemia. In patients who are suffering from chronic
hypoxia at severe levels, clubbing or even cyanosis may be found. Usually, no
therapy is indicated in patients with erythrocytosis, as it is a physiological response
to hypoxia and is a compensatory mechanism.
Secondary polycythemia can be distinguished from primary polycythemia
(polycythemia vera) by the erythropoietin level, which is elevated in secondary
67

polycythemia and low or normal in polycythemia vera. Polycythemia vera is a stem
cell disorder leading to increased RBC mass, which is discussed further in Chapter
9.

THROMBOCYTOPENIA

GENERAL PRINCIPLES

Definition

Platelets are essential for primary hemostasis—the process in which a platelet
plug forms to initiate clotting. Normal platelet range is 150,000 to 450,000/ μL.
When the platelet number is decreased or the platelets are not functioning properly,
bleeding may result.
Classification

Thrombocytopenia can generally be classified into one of the following
processes: decreased platelet production or increased platelet destruction.
DIAGNOSIS

Clinical Presentation

Thrombocytopenia may present either asymptomatically on a routine CBC or
with petechiae, purpura, or overt bleeding, especially of the mucosa. All patients
with thrombocytopenia should undergo a thorough history and physical before
69

choosing further diagnostic testing.
Differential Diagnosis

Decreased platelet production
Infection: HIV, hepatitis C, parvovirus, varicella, rubella, mumps
Chemotherapy
Medications
Radiation
Congenital or acquired primary bone marrow failure: Fanconi anemia,
megakaryocytic thrombocytopenia, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria
Malignancy, particularly hematologic malignancies
Vitamin deficiencies: folate, B12
Alcohol
Increased platelet destruction
Medications: heparin, valproic acid, quinine
Autoimmune platelet destruction: immune thrombocytopenia (ITP),
thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP)/hemolytic-uremic syndrome
(HUS)
HELLP (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelets) syndrome
Disseminated intravascular coagulation(DIC)
Pseudothrombocytopenia

THROMBOTIC THROMBOCYTOPENIC PURPURA AND
HEMOLYTIC-UREMIC SYNDROME

GENERAL PRINCIPLES

Definition

TTP and HUS are clinically similar disorders that are often grouped together as
TTP-HUS. Although pathophysiology distinguishes the two disorders, both involve
microvascular damage and platelet destruction. They are classically defined by
70

thrombocytopenia and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA) in the absence
of another apparent cause. Neurologic and renal impairments are also characteristic.
When neurologic impairment is present, the patient is more likely to be classified as
TTP, whereas acute renal failure is considered to be a hallmark of HUS. In some
cases, there is a significant overlap and patients can have both renal and
neurological impairment.
Epidemiology

TTP has an incidence of ~4 cases/million persons. HUS is an uncommon
disorder with two forms—a sporadic form more typical of adults and a childhood
form that is often associated with verotoxin and Escherichia coli O157:H7. Both
cause thrombocytopenia with MAHA but they are distinct entities. TTP-HUS once
had a 90% mortality rate until the utility of plasma exchange was demonstrated. Six
month mortality now is <30% with prompt initiation of appropriate treatment.1
Pathophysiology

Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. Endothelial cells produce
ultralarge vWF (ULvWF) molecules that are cleaved by ADAMTS13 (a
metalloprotease) into their typical-length multimers under normal
circumstances (fig. 4-1). In a significant number of TTP patients there is
a marked decrease in ADAMTS13 activity(<5%). This protease
deficiency may be inherited or due to acquired inhibitors such as IgG
autoantibodies. When these ULvWF molecules persist, they induce
abnormal platelet aggregation in the microcirculation in areas of high
shear stress. This leads to platelet consumption and fragmenting and
destruction of RBCs. It should be noted that some patients with clinical
TTP do not have decreased ADAMTS13 activity, implicating other
unidentified factors. 1
Hemolytic-uremic syndrome. Although HUS has long been thought to
be related to TTP, ADAMTS13 inhibitors or deficiency does not appear to
be the cause of HUS. HUS also differs from TTP in that it is associated
with selective endothelial damage in the kidneys. Typical childhood HUS
is associated with hemorrhagic diarrhea caused by shiga-toxin-producing
bacteria such as E. coli 0157:H7. Atypical HUS occurs in children and
adults without a preceding diarrheal prodrome and is thought to be
related to complement regulatory abnormalities.2 Atypical HUS is more
likely to recur.

Risk Factors and Associated Conditions

See Table 4-1.
DIAGNOSIS

Clinical Presentation

The classic findings of TTP-HUS include a pentad of physical examination and
lab findings as reported in Table 4-2. The complete pentad does not have to be
present for the diagnosis, and TTP-HUS often presents without fever or neurologic
dysfunction. Renal failure may be oliguric or nonoliguric. TTP may be preceded by
a few weeks of malaise, but neurologic symptoms (including headache, confusion,
vision changes, tinnitus, seizures, and coma) are frequently the first symptoms that
bring a patient to medical attention. These symptoms may wax and wane over the
course of the illness. Bleeding, pancreatitis, and diarrhea can also be associated
with TTP-HUS.
Diagnostic Criteria

73

Anemia and thrombocytopenia are universal. Elevated lactate dehydrogenase
(LDH), elevated indirect bilirubin, and decreased haptoglobin will help identify the
hemolysis associated with the disorder, but a peripheral blood smear is mandatory
for diagnosis to identify schistocytes consistent with MAHA. The reticulocyte count
is usually elevated. Coagulation studies (PT/INR, PTT) are usually within normal
limits, and a DIC panel, including fibrinogen, fibrinogen degradation products
(FdPs), and D-dimer, is useful to rule out DIC as an alternate diagnosis.
ADAMTS13 activity levels may be undetectable; however, treatment should not be
delayed while waiting for this test. Further classification of thrombotic
microangiopathy as either TTP or HUS is usually based upon age, past medical
history, clinical presentation, and the presence or absence of renal dysfunction or
neurologic symptoms.
Differential Diagnosis

Differential diagnosis includes other etiologies of MAHA (DIC, prosthetic valve
hemolysis, malignant hypertension, adenocarcinoma, and vasculitis). Although fever
is part of the pentad, it should also prompt workup for sources of infection. Evans
syndrome (immune thrombocytopenia and autoimmune hemolytic anemia) should be
distinguished by the presence of microspherocytes and absence of schistocytes in the
peripheral smear.
TREATMENT

The primary treatment for TTP-HUS is plasma exchange
(plasmapheresis), with one estimated plasma volume exchanged
daily. Plasma exchange can be done twice daily in severe cases or in
cases that progress despite daily treatments. Because of the high
mortality of untreated TTP-HUS, thrombocytopenia and MAHA are all
that is required to initiate plasma exchange if no other certain cause can
74

be identified. ADAMTS13 levels should not alter decision to perform
plasma exchange. Plasma exchange has also shown benefits in other
thrombotic microangiopathies so it should not be withheld in urgent
cases. The goal of daily plasma exchange should be to reverse the
thrombocytopenia and hemolysis. This can be monitored with LDH and
CBC measurements; the platelet count is the most important factor.
Plasma exchange can be tapered or stopped after the platelet count has
been normal for 2 days. After remission, exacerbations due to
discontinuing plasma exchange (<30 days) should lead to immediate
resumption of plasma exchange. 2
Suspected ADAMTS13 deficiency can also be treated with systemic
corticosteroid therapy in an effort to suppress inhibitors at a dose of 1
mg/kg of prednisone or potentially higher doses in critically ill patients.
Platelet transfusions are relatively contraindicated, except in cases of
life-threatening bleeding.
In patients with refractory or relapsing TTP despite standard therapy,
rituximab may be beneficial at achieving remission and decreasing the
need for plasma exchange in patients with a demonstrated antibody to
ADAMTS13.3

DISSEMINATED INTRAVASCULAR COAGULATION

GENERAL PRINCIPLES

Definition

DIC is an acquired and systemic disorder of hemostasis which produces both
thrombosis and hemorrhage.
Epidemiology

DIC is associated with an underlying illness and is thus a condition most
frequently diagnosed and treated in hospitalized patients. Around 1% of hospital
admissions may be complicated by DIC, although rates approaching 35% may be
seen in patients with severe sepsis syndrome.4
75

Pathophysiology and Etiology

In DIC, an underlying illness leads to systemic activation of the coagulation
cascade, likely mediated by widespread endothelial damage and the release of
inflammatory cytokines. This coagulation activation leads to increased fibrin
formation and subsequent thrombosis, most notably in small and medium-sized
vessels. The widespread thrombosis can lead to organ failure and MAHA.
Widespread thrombosis can also deplete clotting factors and platelets leading to
bleeding.5
Risk Factors/Associated Conditions

See Table 4-3.

76

DIAGNOSIS

Clinical Presentation

DIC can manifest with symptoms related to thrombosis or bleeding. Thrombosis
can lead to digit gangrene, stroke, or organ failure. Bleeding may be in the form of
petechiae, oozing from venipuncture or wound sites, or hemorrhage.
77

Diagnostic Criteria

There are a number of useful laboratory tests to assist in the diagnosis of
DIC. The CBC may reveal anemia or thrombocytopenia, often <100k,
related to thrombotic microangiopathy. Coagulation studies, including
PT/INR and PTT, may be prolonged due to consumption of coagulation
factors. “DIC panels” often measure fibrinogen, FDP, and D-dimer.
Fibrinogen levels are low as a result of consumption, while the FDP and
D-dimers are markers of clot dissolution and are usually elevated. It
should be noted that fibrinogen is an acute phase reactant and may be
elevated due to underlying illness. In such situations, a declining
fibrinogen level may provide a clue to the diagnosis of DIC. A peripheral
smear often reveals schistocytes from the destruction of red cells.
It is important to distinguish DIC from other conditions. Typical
laboratory abnormalities with separate disease processes include: liver
disease (low platelets and prolonged PT and PTT but normal fibrinogen—
except in severe liver disease, which may show low fibrinogen), vitamin
K deficiency (prolonged PT/PTT but normal platelets and fibrinogen), and
TTP (MAHA and thrombocytopenia but normal PT, PTT, and fibrinogen).
TREATMENT
Management should be focused predominantly on identifying and treating the
underlying condition. Symptomatic treatment of bleeding or thrombosis can be
dictated by the clinical scenario. In patients with high bleeding risk or active
bleeding, fresh-frozen plasma to replace clotting factors, cryoprecipitate to replace
fibrinogen (target level >100 mg/dL), and platelet transfusions (target plt >50,000)
are suggested. In patients, predominantly in the thrombotic phase of DIC, low dose
heparin has been suggested, but this is controversial. Low-molecular-weight heparin
(LMWH) may have less risk for bleeding, and some consider it an alternative. In
cases in which the patient has low anti-thrombin III (ATIII) levels and severe DIC,
some consider ATIII replacement (with FFP or ATIII concentrates) a reasonable
option.

HEPARIN-INDUCED THROMBOCYTOPENIA (HIT)

78

GENERAL PRINCIPLES

Definition and Classification

Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia can be classified into two separate entities:
HIT I and HIT II.
HIT I is non-immune mediated and characterized by a transient fall in platelet
count. This form of HIT is not an indication for discontinuing heparin.
The remainder of this chapter focuses on HIT II, which will simply be referred
to as HIT.
Epidemiology and Etiology

HIT is an acquired prothrombotic complication of heparin therapy. It is an
immune-mediated disorder caused by IgG Abs that bind to platelet factor 4
(PF4)–heparin complexes. The frequency in one meta-analysis was 2. 6% in
patients treated with UFH and 0. 2% in those treated with LMWH.6
Pathophysiology

As a primary specific immune response, HIT syndrome generally has a
delayed onset of 4 to 5 days after administration of heparin or LMWH.
PF4 is a heparin-neutralizing chemokine protein found within the alphagranules of platelets. This protein binds exogenous heparin (UFH >
LWMH) and forms multimer complexes which can provoke an IgG
antibody formation. Once formed, the HIT-IgG Ab (HIT Ab)–PF4–heparin
complex can activate platelets and other cells, generate immunogenic
multi-molecular complexes, and promote tissue factor expression and
thrombin generation, leading to significant risk for thrombotic events.
Platelets targeted by HIT specific antibodies are cleared from the
circulation, causing thrombocytopenia.7
Risk Factors

HIT is more common in adult medical and surgical patients than in obstetric or
pediatric patients. UFH is ~ 10 times more likely than LMWH to produce HIT.
Patients receiving IV heparin are more likely to develop HIT than those receiving
SC heparin.7
79

DIAGNOSIS

Clinical Presentation

Thrombocytopenia or a >50% fall in platelet count occur in ~ 95% of
patients diagnosed with HIT. The average platelet count is 50,000 to
70,000.7
There are three time courses of HIT: typical, rapid, and delayed-onset
HIT.
In typical-onset HIT, thrombocytopenia develops ~ 5 to 10 days after
initiation of heparin therapy, approximately the amount of time
necessary to generate a humoral immune response.
A subset of patients experience rapid-onset HIT, where
thrombocytopenia occurs within 24 hours, indicating a recent exposure to
heparin during the preceding weeks.
Delayed-onset HIT occurs days after heparin has been stopped. This
form of HIT is not well understood. These patients typically have hightiter platelet-activating HIT Ab. It is uncommon for HIT to occur if
heparin has been discontinued for more than 2 weeks.
HIT can present as thrombosis. The most common manifestation is
venous thromboembolism (deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary
embolism) in the postoperative setting. Though less common, arterial
thrombosis can occur and is manifested as stroke, myocardial infarction,
or limb ischemia.
A clinical scoring system using the 4 Ts (Thombocytopenia, Timing of
platelet fall, Thrombosis, and other causes) has been shown to help risk
stratify patients with suspected HIT.8
Diagnostic Testing

Initial diagnosis should be made based on the clinical scenario and after other
causes of thrombocytopenia have been ruled out. Presently, most medical centers
employ an immunoassay for the presence of PF4/heparin antibodies. This test is
rapid and sensitive (>99%) though it lacks specificity (40% to 70%).7 Functional
assays are more specific than HIT immunoassays but are not as widely available.
Functional assays measure platelet activation at varying heparin concentrations. One
such test, the serotonin release assay, utilizes radiolabeled serotonin to measure
80

platelet activation. The test is considered positive when serotonin is released from
donor platelets placed in patient serum when a low concentration of heparin is
added. These tests are reported to have >95% sensitivity and specificity.7
TREATMENT

Medications

The first step in treating HIT is the discontinuation of heparin. Return of
laboratory assay results often takes several days. Therefore, all heparin products,
including heparin flushes and heparin-coated catheters, should be discontinued
immediately if HIT is suspected. Because of cross-reactivity to the HIT Ab, LMWH
should not be substituted. For patients who are strongly suspected of having HIT,
non-heparin anticoagulation should be promptly instituted.
Agents which can treat HIT are classified as direct thrombin inhibitors
(lepirudin, argatroban, and bivalirudin), indirect factor Xa inhibitors (danaparoid
and fondaparinux), and vitamin K antagonists (warfarin).
Lepirudin is a recombinant hirudin, a natural anticoagulant found in the
salivary glands of medicinal leeches. This drug has been approved by the
FDA for patients with HIT for the prevention and treatment of
thrombosis. Lepirudin is renally cleared and should be dose-adjusted in
patients with chronic kidney disease.
Argatroban has also been approved by the FDA for the prevention and
treatment of thrombosis associated with HIT. This drug is hepatically
cleared and should be used with caution in patients with impaired
hepatic function.
Bivalirudin is a direct thrombin inhibitor specifically approved for
patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention.
Danaparoid is a heparinoid factor Xa inhibitor that is no longer marketed
in the United States. It had previously been approved by the FDA for
prophylaxis in HIT patients undergoing hip replacement surgery.
Fondaparinux is a synthetic pentasaccharide Xa inhibitor which
received a Grade 2C recommendation in the 2008 ACCP guidelines for
treatment of HIT. It has not been FDA approved for this indication and
controversy exists because several cases of HIT caused by Fondaparinux
have been reported.
Warfarin should not be used to treat a patient with HIT in the acute
81

setting given the risk of venous limb gangrene and thrombosis with
depletion of protein C. Warfarin can be started for long term
anticoagulation when the patient has been anticoagulated with one of
the above agents and the platelet count has reached a stable plateau
>150,000. Warfarin should be started at a low dose (5 to 6 mg) and
should overlap with one of the above agents for at least 5 days.9

Immune Thrombocytopenia (ITP)

GENERAL PRINCIPLES

Definition

Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is an acquired disorder characterized by
isolated thrombocytopenia. ITP is also known as immune thrombocytopenic purpura
or idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, but changes in terminology have been
proposed as more has become understood about ITP.10
Classification

Primary ITP is an immune mediated disorder without clear cause.
Secondary ITP is because of an underling disease, infection, or
exposure.
ITP can be further classified as newly diagnosed (<3 months),
persistent (3 to 12 months), and chronic (> 12 months).
DIAGNOSIS

Clinical Presentation

Patients often present with asymptomatic thrombocytopenia noted on routine
CBC, but patients also frequently present with minor bleeding manifestations
including petechiae, purpura, easy bruising, gingival bleeding, and menorrhagia.
Less frequently, patients present with more severe bleeding including overt GI
82

bleeding and intracranial hemorrhage.
History

Patient history should include a focus on bleeding symptoms and causes of
secondary ITP or other hematologic disorders. Of particular importance are
constitutional symptoms, prior thrombocytopenia, autoimmune diseases, hematologic
diseases, liver disease, recent or chronic infections, recent transfusion, recent
immunization, and medication exposures.
Physical Examination

Bleeding manifestations are frequently noted in ITP, but other abnormal exam
findings should raise suspicion for secondary ITP or alternative causes of
thrombocytopenia.
Diagnostic Testing

ITPisa diagnosis of exclusion and no gold standard test exists.
The CBC should reveal isolated thrombocytopenia unless bleeding is
severe enough to produce concurrent anemia.
Reviewofthe peripheral blood smear is essential to rule out other
causes of thrombocytopenia including pseudothrombocytopenia from
platelet clumping and other diagnoses including TTP/HUS.
A bone marrow biopsy can be considered in patients > 60 years old or
when the history and physical or other diagnostic data raise suspicion for
a separate underlying hematologic disease.
HIV, HCV, and Helicobacter pylori testing should be considered in
at risk patients. Baseline thyroid function testing and quantitative serum
immunoglobulin testing should also be considered.
TREATMENT
The primary goal of treatment in ITP is to prevent bleeding. When the platelet
count is >50 × 109/L treatment is not always necessary, but treatment should be
considered if the patient is at increased risk for bleeding such as in known platelet
dysfunction, trauma or predisposition to trauma, necessity for anticoagulation, or
planned surgery. Multiple therapeutic modalities exist, and treatment should be
tailored for each individual patient.10
83

First-Line Therapy

Corticosteroids: Prednisone 1 mg/kg/d can be given until normalization
of platelet count at which point steroids can be tapered to avoid side
effects. Dexamethasone and methylprednisolone are other
considerations.
IVIg: IVIg can be given at dose of 1 g/kg/d × 2 days or 0. 4 g/kg/d × 5
days with consideration of maintenance dosing.
IV anti-D: 50 to 75 μg/kg/d of IV anti-D can be considered in Rh(D)
positive patients who have not undergone splenectomy and who do not
have history of autoimmune hemolytic anemia.
Second-Line Therapy

Splenectomy
Eighty percent initial response rates are reported after splenectomy
while sustained response is observed in around two-thirds of patients.
Laparotomy has higher complication and mortality rates than
laparoscopy. Prophylactic vaccinations should be administered after
splenectomy to prevent subsequent infections.
Medical therapy
Multiple drugs can be considered as second line agents including
azathioprine, cyclosporine A, cyclophosphamide, danazol, dapsone,
mycophenolate mofetil, rituximab, and vinca alkaloid regimens.
Thrombopoietin-receptor agonists including romiplostim and
eltrombopag can be considered and may be particularly useful in those
who cannot tolerate long-term immunomodulatory therapy.
Refractory ITP

For patients with severe refractory disease combination chemotherapy,
alemtuzumab, and allogeneic stem cell transplantation can be considered.
Emergency Therapy

In emergent situations such as in life threatening bleeding or emergency surgery,
combination therapies and platelet transfusions should be considered. Aminocaproic
acid may be useful in preventing rebleeding in persistently thrombocytopenic
patients.11
84

THROMBOSIS

GENERAL PRINCIPLES
A platelet count exceeding the reference range is called thrombocytosis.
Thrombocytosis may be reactive or due to autonomous production of platelets by
clonal megakaryocytes (essential thrombocythemia or other myeloproliferative
disorders).
Reactive thrombocytosis is thrombocytosis in the absence of a chronic
myeloproliferative disorder. It can be seen in the setting of infection, surgery,
malignancy, blood loss, and iron deficiency or postsplenectomy. The platelet count
is expected to normalize when the underlying process is corrected.

GENERAL PRINCIPLES
The hemostatic system is a complex, regulated, sequence of reactions involving
interactions among platelets, endothelium, and coagulation factors (Table 5-1).
DIAGNOSIS

Workup of suspected hemostasis disorders (Table 5-2; Fig.5-1)
Complete blood count (CBC)
Reveals thrombocytopenia if present.
Assesses whether the patient has developed clinically significant anemia
Leukocytosis or leukopenia may implicate a hematologic malignancy as
the cause of a patient’s coagulopathy or thrombocytopenia.
Peripheral smear reveals the presence of microangiopathy, platelet
clumping, and red and white blood cell morphology.
Prothrombin time/international normalized ratio (PT/INR)
Historically, PT values have varied from institution to institution due to
differences in commercial thromboplastin. The INR system has markedly
reduced interlaboratory variability. This ratio standardizes all PT assays
and is calculated as
INR = [(PT patient)/(PT laboratory mean)]ISI
(ISI—International Sensitivity Index for the thromboplastin reagent
87

used)
Activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT)
Thrombin time (TT)
Workup of elevated PT or aPTT1
First, pre-analytical variables should be considered, such as
incomplete filling of blood collection tubes
heparin contamination
other confounding factors include a high hematocrit (>55%) and plasma
turbidity (lipemic, hemolyzed, or icteric specimens)
Second, determine which pathway of the coagulation cascade is
defective (see Table 5-2):
prolonged PT alone—extrinsic pathway
prolonged a PTT alone—intrinsic pathway
prolonged PTT and a PTT—both pathways
Third, perform a mixing study to determine whether the abnormality is
due to an inhibitor present in the patient’s plasma or a factor deficiency
(Figs. 5-2 through 5-4).

88

Mixing studies (Table 5-3)
Goal: to determine whether a prolonged PT or aPTT is due to factor
deficiencies or inhibitors.
Method: patient’s plasma is mixed with normal plasma at a 1:1 ratio and
the PT or the aPTT is performed immediately and after incubation at
37°C for 1 hour.
Workup of lupus anticoagulants (LAs)
LAs may occur in the presence or absence of systemic lupus erythematosus or
other autoimmune diseases. They are associated with recurrent fetal loss and venous
or arterial thromboembolic disease.
Routine aPTT and PT reagents are not sensitive enough to be used to screen for
LA, so modifications have been made to develop LA-sensitive clotting tests with the
following steps: (a) demonstration of prolonged phospholipid-dependent clotting
89

time (such as modified aPTT, PT, or common pathway clotting test); (b) persistent
prolongation of the clotting time after mixing with normal pooled plasma; (c)
neutralization of the inhibitor by addition of excess phospholipid; (d) ruling out of a
specific factor inhibitor (such as anti-factor VIII autoantibody). No LA test will
detect 100% of LAs, therefore current guidelines require using at least two different
sensitive clotting tests to screen for and confirm the presence of LA. If one or both
tests are positive, testing should be repeated at least 12 weeks later. It is only
clinically significant if positive LA is persistent and associated with an increased
risk of future thrombotic complications.

90

FIGURE 5-1. The normal coagulation cascade is split into the intrinsic
pathway and the extrinsic pathway, either of which leads to activation of factor X to
Xa. The factors after that point are referred to as the common pathway. Disorders of
the intrinsic pathway are manifest as prolongation of the aPTT. Disorders of the
extrinsic pathway are reflected by prolongation of the PT, whereas disorders of the
common pathway will prolong both tests.
Coagulation factor assays
These are clot-based assays to determine the functional levels of the factors in
the coagulation cascade. These tests are usually obtained when there is a suspicion
91

of factor deficiency or inhibitors.
Factor VIII assay
Goal is to determine factor VIII level.

FIGURE 5-2. General workup of an elevated PT in the setting of a normal
aPTT.
Crucial test for diagnosing hemophilia A and von Willebrand disease
(vWD) and for monitoring response to therapy in hemophilia.
Method: Determine the level of factor VIII in the patient’s plasma by
mixing dilutions of the patient’s plasma with factor VIII–deficient plasma
and comparing the result to that of similar dilutions of normal pooled
plasma mixed with factor VIII–deficientplasma.

92

FIGURE 5-3. General workup of an elevated aPTT in the setting of a normal
PT.

93

FIGURE 5-4. General workup of an elevation of both the PT and the aPTT.
Assessing deficiency of other factors
The same procedure as described for the factor VIII assay is used to
determine the activity of other intrinsic pathway coagulation factors,
using the corresponding deficient plasma for dilutions.
The extrinsic and common pathway factor activities are determined by
comparing PT results for patient and normal pooled plasma diluted in
plasma depleted of factor VII, X, or V or prothrombin.
Factor VIII inhibitor quantification (Bethesda units)
Indicated to test for factor VIII inhibitors. Factor VIII inhibitors are
suspected when there is a normal PT; a prolonged aPTT that is partially
corrected immediately after 1:1 mixing with normal plasma but
prolonged again after 1 to 2 hours of incubation; and a very low factor
VIII activity (usually <1%).

94

Appropriate treatment requires determining the titer of the inhibitor,
which is measured as arbitrary Bethesda units.
Method: Serial dilutions of patient plasma are mixed with an equal
volume of normal pooled plasma, and residual factor VIII activity is
measured after 2 hours of incubation at 37°C.
The Bethesda titer is the reciprocal of the plasma dilution that
neutralizes 50% of the factor VIII activity of normal pooled plasma.
A titer of BU <5 indicates a mild inhibitor that may be overwhelmed by
larger infusions of factor VIII, whereas an inhibitor with a titer of BU >5
will likely require infusion of a bypass coagulation concentrate such as
recombinant factor VIIa or activated prothrombin concentrate complex
toachievehemostasis.
Studies of platelet function
Bleeding time
Method: Standardized incision is made in the patient’s forearm, and the
duration of time to cessation of bleeding is measured.
Indication: To detect primary hemostasis defects (vWD and qualitative
platelet disorders) in patients with histories of recurrent mucosal
bleeding.
Although it can be a useful test for identifying problems with primary
hemostasis, many variables may artificially prolong the bleeding time,
such as medications that interfere with platelet function, differences in
operator procedure and interpretation, subcutaneous edema, or thinning
of the skin.
It is not an accurate predictor of surgical bleeding risk in asymptomatic
95

subjects; therefore, its use has markedly declined and replaced by PFA100.
Platelet function analyzer-100 (PFA-100)2
An in vitro screening test of primary hemostasis.
Method: Citrated whole blood is aspirated through a microscopic hole in
a piece of nitrocellulose paper coated with collagen and epinephrine
(COL/ EPI) or collagen and ADP (COL/ADP). The flow conditions mimic
the shear stress in a capillary bed. vWF adheres to the collagen, and
platelets adhere to the vWF, followed by agonist-mediated activation,
aggregation, and eventual closure of the hole. The time to occlusion is
reported as the closure time. The COL/EPI cartridge is sensitive to
qualitative platelet disorders, especially aspirin effect, and vWD. The
COL/ADP cartridge is less sensitive to aspirin but remains sensitive to
vWD. Neither cartridge is sensitive to ADP receptor inhibitors such as
clopidogrel (Plavix).
Normal PFA-100 closure times do not rule out mild qualitative platelet
disorders, and if clinical suspicion is high, platelet aggregation studies
should be performed.
PFA-100 has not been validated for preoperative assessment of bleeding
risk in asymptomatic patients.
A hematocrit of <30% or a platelet count of <100,000/μL can produce
false-positive results.
Platelet aggregation studies
Indicated when an inherited qualitative defect in platelet function is
suggested by the clinical and/or family history.
Method: Various aggregating agents (arachidonic acid, collagen, ADP,
epinephrine, and ristocetin) are added to the initially turbid platelet-rich
plasma specimen. The platelets clump, permitting more light to pass
through the plasma. The results with each agent are displayed
graphically and interpreted as normal or abnormal.
This qualitative test is very labor intensive and should only be performed
in highly selected cases.
As many prescription or over-the-counter medications can affect in vitro
measurements of platelet function, almost all inpatients should be
excluded.
Outpatients must discontinue aspirin-containing medications and
clopidogrel (Plavix) for at least 7 days and NSAIDs for at least 72 hours
96

before testingtoavoidfalse-positiveresults.
Laboratory evaluation of suspected von Willebrand disease
(seeTable 5-4)3 Important tests to evaluate vWD include vWF antigen
(vWF:Ag), factor VIII activity, ristocetin cofactor activity assay, collagenbinding assay, vWF multimer assay, ristocetin-induced platelet
aggregation (RIPA) analysis, and factor VIII binding ELISA. No single test
is adequate to diagnose vWD by itself. When abnormal tests are found
suggesting vWD, these tests should be repeated to confirm the
diagnosis. If two sets of tests do not agree, testing symptomatic firstdegree relatives for vWD may be appropriate. See Chapter 7 for detailed
discussion of vWD.
von Willebrand factor antigen concentration (vWF:Ag)
vWF:Ag levels are measured against a normal reference sample and
typically levels >50% of reference are considered normal.
Note that vWF:Ag reference intervals are blood type dependent. Healthy
type O subjects may have vWF concentrations as low as 40% compared
to normal pooled plasma, while the lower limit of the reference range for
non-O controls will be ≥50%. Most laboratories do not provide blood
type-specific reference intervals and are likely to have a lower limit
~50%. Therefore, some healthy individuals with blood type O and
unimpressive personal and family histories of abnormal bleeding may
have vWF:Ag, vWF activity, or factor VIII activity <50% due to their
blood type but are incorrectly diagnosed with type 1 vWD.
The vWF:Ag concentration will be abnormally low in all type 3, most
type 1, and some type 2 vWD.
Ristocetin cofactor assay
The ability of the patient’s plasma (platelet poor plasma) to aggregate
normal platelets in the presence of ristocetin is compared with that of a
normal pooled plasma specimen.
Ristocetin is an antibiotic that that was off the market because it causes
severe thrombocytopenia due to in vivo agglutination of platelets to
vWF.
More than 50% is considered normal, but healthy blood type O patients
may have lower activity (see discussion above).
This test is useful when used with the vWF:Ag test in the vWF ristocetin
cofactor/vWF:Ag ratio. A ratio ≤0.7 suggests a qualitative defect of vWF,
which indicates a diagnosis of vWD type 2A, 2B, or 2M and requires vWF
97

multimer assay and RIPA analysis for finaltyping.
Collagen-binding assay
This ELISA is especially useful for identifying the presence of high
molecular weight forms of vWF. Collagen is immobilized in the test well,
and following incubation with plasma and washing, bound vWF is
measured.
Patients with types 2A and 2B vWD are deficient in high molecular
weight vWF, therefore this test is useful in their diagnosis. As described
earlier, reference comparison with >50% levels are considered normal.
This test is used in comparison with the vWF:Ag test in the vWF collagen
binding/vWF:Ag ratio (normal, >0.7).
This test is not popular and rarely used in the United States.

98

von Willebrand factor multimer assay
The multimer assay involves labor-intensive gel electrophoresis
techniques to separate vWF into bands that normally range in size from
0.5 to 20 million daltons.
Loss of large and intermediate multimers is seen in type 2A and 2B
vWD.
Normal distribution of vWF multimers is seen in type 2M cWD.
This should not be part of initial workup for vWD, only indicated for
suspected type 2A/2B/2M, possibly type 3.
This test is not routinely performed at most institutions.
Ristocetin-induced platelet aggregation (RIPA) analysis (Table
5-5)
The aggregation of the patient’s platelets is tested in the presence of
different concentrations of ristocetin.
Used for differentiating vWD type 2B from 2A or 2M.
RIPA is used only after the diagnosis of vWD is made and further
clarification of subtype is necessary.
Factor VIII binding ELISA
Indicated to assist in the diagnose type 2N vWD, which is characterized
by impaired binding of vWF to factor VIII.
PFA-100 closure time
Can be used to screen for vWD in patients with an appropriate bleeding
history, and to monitor response to 1-desamino-8-D-arginine vasopressin
(DDAVP; which stimulates release of vWF stored in endothelial cells) or
infusion of vWF concentrate (Humate-P), since other vWF tests may not
be available on a STAT basis.

GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Thrombotic disease refers to the inappropriate formation of a clot in the venous
or arterial circulation. Arterial and venous thrombi form in the presence of Virchow
triad: hypercoagulability, stasis, and endothelial damage. Embolism of these clots
can occur, causing a pulmonary embolism (PE) when arising from the venous
circulation or a systemic embolus when arising from the arterial circulation. Risk
factors for venous thrombosis include immobility, surgery, increasing age, obesity,
pregnancy, and an inherited or acquired hypercoagulable state (Table 6-1).1
Thrombotic disease often results from an interaction of genetic predisposition and
environmental factors. Evaluation of patients presenting with thrombosis includes
identification of risk factors, recommendations on appropriate anticoagulant
management and duration of therapy, and in carefully selected cases, workup for
thrombophilia or hypercoagulable state.

DEEP VENOUS THROMBOSIS AND PULMONARY
EMBOLUS

General Principles

Definition

The term venous thromboembolism (VTE) encompasses both deep venous
101

thrombosis (DVT) and PE.
Epidemiology1

The annual incidence of DVT is approximately 100 per 100,000 persons per
year. About 40% to 50% of people with a symptomatic DVT will have a silent PE,
and 1% to 8% of patients with a PE will die of its complications.
Prevention

Primary prevention of VTE in the hospitalized patient with risk factors is
essential. These risk factors include an acute infectious disease, congestive heart
failure, malignancy, stroke, acute pulmonary disease, acute rheumatic disease,
inflammatory bowel disease, and critical illness. Expert opinion recommends that
all medical patients older than 40, who are expected to have at least 3 days of
inpatient stay and have one risk factor, should be provided with DVT prophylaxis.
Prophylaxis can be nonpharmacologic, with compression stockings or pneumatic
compression devices. However, there are no large, blinded trials proving that these
interventions prevent VTE in medical patients. For patients without a
contraindication to low-dose anticoagulation who need prophylaxis, pharmacologic
agents are recommended. Subcutaneous heparin three times a day, low-molecularweight heparin (LMWH) once daily, and fondaparinux once daily have been shown
to have equal efficacy in preventing VTE with minimal increased bleeding risk and
have been wildly used as DVT prophylaxis in hospitalized patients.2

102

Diagnosis3,4

Clinical Presentation
History

Symptoms of acute DVT and PE can be variable; however, common symptoms
include
DVT—acute onset of pain, swelling, and pain at a unilateral extremity
PE—dyspnea, pleuritic chest pain, cough, anxiety, and hemoptysis
Physical Examination

DVT—unilateral extremity tenderness, erythema, and unequal circumference of
extremities
PE—tachypnea, tachycardia, and inspiratory crackles

103

Diagnostic Testing
Laboratories

D-dimer is a cheap and fast initial screening test, particularly in patients with
low suspicion of VTE. D-dimer is the result of fibrin breakdown and is generated in
many other circumstances, including infections, tumors, surgery, trauma, extensive
burning, bruises, ischemic heart disease, stroke, peripheral artery disease,
aneurysms, inflammatory disease, and pregnancy. The sensitivity of the D-dimer test
in clinical trials ranges from 93% to 100%; however, the specificity ranges from
35% to 75%. Therefore, it is effective for ruling out the diagnosis if negative, but a
positive D-dimer assay is not specific and requires additional workup. In cases of
very high clinical suspicion, testing should be pursued despite a negative D-dimer.
Electrocardiography

The most common finding in PE is sinus tachycardia. The classic ECG changes
associated with PE are S wave in lead I, Q wave in lead III, and inverted T wave in
lead III (SI, QIII, TIII). However, these findings are neither sensitive nor specific
for PE (present in 13.5% of patients with PE). New right axis deviation is another
clue for right-sided heart strain from PE.
Imaging

Doppler ultrasonography is the test of choice for diagnosing DVT.3
Sensitivity and specificity for DVT are > 97%, with venography
considered the gold standard.
A positive Doppler study should lead one to treat the patient.
A negative study largely rules out the diagnosis, and alternative
diagnoses should be considered.
In cases of very high suspicion and negative Doppler study, venography
or CT (or MR) venography can be considered.
The most commonly used tests for the diagnosis of PE are CT
angiography (CTA) of the lungs or ventilation/perfusion scans (V/Q
scans), although the most useful algorithms and radiographic tests used
to diagnose acute PE are still debatable and the subject of ongoing
trials.4,5
Determining a clinical pretest probability of PE is necessary before
performing any diagnostic tests. Objective criteria such as the Wells
Criteria (Table 6-2) are commonly used to determine the pretest
104

probability.
The PIOPED trial used V/Q scans in the diagnosis of acute PE (Table 63).6
The PIOPED II trial published in 2006 used CTA of the lungs and CT
venography of the lower extremities to diagnose PE (Table 6-3).7 As
shown in Table 6-3, in patients with a high pretest probability and
negative CTA, PE is still present in 40% of cases; therefore, these
patients should undergo further testing such as venous compression
ultrasonography of the lower extremities or CT venogram of lower
extremities.
Based on the results of these trials, an algorithm for the diagnosis of PE
has been recommended (Fig. 6-1).8

105

In special cases such as patients with renal failure, patients with allergy to
contrast dye, women of childbearing age, and pregnant women, the recommendations
are guided by expert opinion. In these patients, the algorithm should begin with Ddimer testing followed by venous ultrasonography in the majority of cases. Patients
with a positive D-dimer and a negative ultrasound will then need additional testing.
Ventilation/perfusion scanning can then be used, with the realization that the testing
may be nondiagnostic.
Treatment9
Treatment of VTE with unfractionated heparin or LMWH should begin promptly
after the diagnosis is established or, in situations of high clinical suspicion, while
awaiting confirmatory studies. Thrombolytics may be considered in selected patients
with hemodynamically significant PE. Individuals who are actively bleeding or at
high risk for bleeding should be considered for inferior vena cava (IVC) filter
placement.
106

Medications

Most common medications used in the treatment of VTE are summarized in
Table 6-4.
Low-molecular-weight heparin
A recent meta-analysis concluded that LMWH is superior to
unfractionated heparin for the treatment of DVT, with a lower overall
mortality over the first 3 to 6 months and a reduced incidence of major
bleeding during initial therapy.
In patients with cancer, LMWH for the duration of therapy is superior to
oral coumarins in reducing the risk of recurrent thromboembolism
without increasing the bleeding risk.10

107

The duration of anticoagulation is variable and depends on a number
of factors, including underlying thrombotic risk and risk of bleeding.11
Current recommendations suggest that 3 months of treatment is
adequate for provoked DVT (i.e., an identifiable and reversible risk
factor, such as trauma) and most suggest longer treatment, such as 6
months, for PE.

108

for the Christopher Study Investigators. Effectiveness of managing suspected
pulmonary embolism using an algorithm combining clinical probability, D-dimer
testing, and computed tomography. JAMA. 2006;295:172–179.)
Unprovoked VTE or a recurrent episode should be treated for an
extended duration. The precise length of treatment is still debated. Many
trials have treated patients for 3 months to 1 year after an initial
unprovoked VTE. However, recurrent events occurred in similar numbers
after treatment was stopped, regardless of the initial length of
treatment. Therefore, most experts recommend treatment for 3 to 6
months for unprovoked VTE, with the realization that after completion of
therapy there may be a recurrence.
For patients with recurrent VTE, the recommendation is lifelong
anticoagulation.
Thrombolytics12
The role of thrombolytics in the management of VTE has not been fully
elucidated. Thrombolytics dissolve clot faster than conventional
anticoagulation; however, the risk of bleeding is significantly increased.
A recent meta-analysis suggested that thrombolytics should be reserved
for patients with PE and circulatory shock, as there are data
109

demonstrating a survival advantage in these patients.
Thrombolytics can be used for DVT to decrease symptoms and
postthrombotic syndrome.
Prior to treatment with thrombolytics, clinicians must carefully evaluate
the patient for any contraindications to thrombolytic therapy,
including recent surgery, bleeding diathesis, recent stroke, active
intracranial disease (including neoplasm, aneurysm), pregnancy, and
uncontrolled hypertension. A careful risk/benefit analysis is warranted in
every patient.
Other Nonpharmacologic Therapies

Inferior Vena Cava Filters13
The use of IVC filters has increased significantly in the past 10 to 20 years, even
as evidence supporting their use remains insufficient. Only one randomized
controlled trial has compared the use of IVC filters with anticoagulation to the use of
anticoagulation alone. At 2 years of follow-up, there was a mild increase in PEs
(largely asymptomatic) in those without the filters and an increase in DVT and
postthrombotic syndrome in those with the filters. There was no difference in
mortality. Retrievable IVC filters have recently been studied with some
encouraging results for patients with temporary contraindications to anticoagulation.
These filters can be retrieved up to 2 months after initial placement with minimal
adverse effects.
The only currently recommended indication for IVC filter placement is in
patients with an absolute contraindication to anticoagulation. Potential indications
that require additional study include the following:
Patients who developed new VTE on therapeutic anticoagulation
Patients undergoing pulmonary thromboembolectomy
Prophylaxis in high-risk trauma patients
Patients with extensive free-floating iliofemoral thrombus
Patients undergoing thrombolysis of an iliocaval thrombus
Special Considerations

Acute Recurrent Thrombosis
The diagnosis of recurrent venous thrombosis in the same vein can be difficult.
Diagnostic tests currently available have difficulty differentiating between a venous
occlusion caused by the initial venous thrombosis and a recurrence. The diagnosis of
110

recurrent DVT commonly can only be made with certainty if there is a clot in an area
that was documented to be free of thrombus on prior studies. The risk of new
thrombosis in adequately anticoagulated patients is very low, but recurrence can
occur, particularly in patients with cancer, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, and
the antiphospholipid antibody syndrome.
Venous Thrombosis During Pregnancy
The risk of VTE is five times higher in pregnant women than nonpregnant
women. As warfarin is teratogenic and can cause fetal hemorrhage, heparins have
been the mainstay of therapy. Currently, the general recommendation is to use
LMWH for the duration of pregnancy and then continue therapy with warfarin after
delivery.
Thrombosis of Cerebral Veins and Sinuses14
Although rare, the thrombosis of cerebral veins and sinuses is important to
identify because, with appropriate treatment, patients often have a good neurologic
outcome. Occlusion of cerebral veins leads to localized brain edema and venous
infarction, whereas occlusion of the venous sinuses leads to intracranial
hypertension. About 85% of patients have an identifiable risk factor, including a
thrombophilia, oral contraceptive use, recent trauma (including lumbar puncture),
and infection. The most common presenting symptom is unrelenting headache.
The diagnosis can be difficult to make, with an average delay of 7 days from
initial presentation to diagnosis. Venography is the current recommended diagnostic
modality.
Even with the theoretical risk of causing cerebral hemorrhage, the limited
evidence suggests a benefit of rapid initiation of anticoagulation, with therapy
continuing for at least 6 months. Endovascular thrombolysis has been attempted in
some patients. In patients who develop intracranial hypertension, therapy including
repeated lumbar punctures, acetazolamide, and possibly surgical creation of a
lumboperitoneal shunt may be warranted. More than 80% of patients have a good
neurologic outcome if appropriately treated.
A search for a thrombophilia should be pursued in these patients.
Budd–Chiari Syndrome
Budd–Chiari syndrome encompasses various disease states that result in hepatic
vein occlusion. Thrombosis of the hepatic veins leads to hepatomegaly, right-upper
quadrant pain, and other sequelae of acute or chronic liver disease. The most
common causes of Budd–Chiari syndrome in the Western world are the
myeloproliferative disorders. All patients should undergo screening for
thrombophilia and age-appropriate malignancy including myeloproliferative
disorders. The decision to use anticoagulation should be based on the extent of liver
disease and subsequent risk of bleeding. In certain cases, liver transplantation is the
111

treatment of choice.
Mesenteric and Portal Venous Thrombosis
Portal vein thrombosis often presents after the disease has caused splenomegaly
and both esophageal and gastric varices. The main risk factors include local causes
(pancreatitis, tumor, infection) as well as thrombophilic states such as
myeloproliferative disorders. Treatment involves anticoagulation, assuming that the
degree of thrombocytopenia related to splenomegaly and the extent of varices are
minimal.
Mesenteric venous thrombosis presents acutely, with a mortality rate ranging
from 20% to 50%. The usual presentation is severe abdominal pain and bloody
diarrhea. Risk factors include intra-abdominal inflammation and thrombophilias.
Myeloproliferative disorders are only rarely associated with thrombosis of the
mesenteric veins. Treatment includes anticoagulation and surgery if the bowel
becomes necrotic.
Renal Vein Thrombosis
Renal vein thrombosis is frequently asymptomatic and incidentally discovered.
These patients should be evaluated for nephrotic syndrome as well as other more
common thrombophilias. Treatment involves anticoagulation, with thrombolysis
reserved for patients with acute and marked deterioration in renal function due to the
thrombosis.
Upper Extremity DVT
DVTs occur in the upper extremity in 10% of cases. Risk factors specific to
upper extremity DVT include indwelling central venous catheters and local trauma.
Patients usually have unilateral upper extremity edema. Diagnosis is by
ultrasonography or venography. Approximately one-third of upper extremity DVTs
will cause PE, so treatment is essential. While there are limited studies guiding
treatment, it is generally recommended to fully anticoagulate patients for at least 3
months. The use of thrombolytics is controversial.
Anticoagulation in Patients with Brain Metastases or Primary
Brain Tumors
The use of anticoagulation for patients with either primary brain malignancies
or metastases to the brain has been controversial. In the past, it was thought that due
to the risk of hemorrhage, anticoagulation should be absolutely contraindicated in
these patients. However, the limited evidence currently available suggests that
anticoagulation is preferable to IVC filters in the majority of cases. Highly vascular
tumors such as melanoma, thyroid, and renal cell metastases are still felt to be
contraindications to anticoagulation.
Cancer
Patients with cancer have an increased risk of thrombotic events. In a recent
112

cohort study, the incidence of VTE within the first 6 months of diagnosis was ~12%;
the risk increased with chemotherapy and metastatic disease. Cancer of the ovary,
pancreas, and lung, and hematologic cancers are associated with a high rate of VTE
in the year prior to diagnosis. Thus, occult malignancy as a cause of VTE should
always be a consideration in the appropriate clinical scenario.
Trousseau syndrome is a hypercoagulable state associated with malignancy
and is characterized by DIC and recurrent arterial or venous thrombotic events.
Multiple studies have shown that LMWH is superior to oral coumarins in the
treatment of VTE in patients with cancer, with the main benefit in decreasing the
recurrence of DVT, with similar overall mortality.
Complications

Chronic PEs can result in pulmonary hypertension leading to rightsided heart failure.
Symptoms vary from venous stasis pigment changes and/or slight pain
and swelling to more severe manifestations such as chronic pain,
intractable edema, and leg ulcers. Symptoms can be similar to acute
DVT; however, image studies showed no DVT. Symptoms can be
profound and affect quality of life.
Treatment of the syndrome is largely supportive and often inadequate.
Therefore, prevention by appropriately treating initial DVT is important.
Incidence of postthrombotic syndrome can be reduced with prompt
anticoagulation and the use of compression stockings. Two trials have
suggested that the use of compression stockings for 2 years after the
diagnosis of DVT can decrease the incidence of postthrombotic syndrome
by half.

THROMBOPHILIA

General Principles
The presence of inherited thrombotic disorders (thrombophilia) has been
appreciated for only a few decades. Inherited causes of thrombophilia can be either
gain-of-function disorders, in which mutations lead to prothrombotic activity
113

(activated protein C resistance/factor V Leiden, prothrombin G20210A), or loss-offunction disorders, which result in deficiencies of endogenous anticoagulants
(antithrombin, protein C, and protein S). Common mutations include factor V Leiden
and prothrombin G20210A mutations, while other thrombophilias, such as
antithrombin, protein C, and protein S deficiencies, are rare.
Etiology16,17

Activated Protein C Resistance/Factor V Leiden
This is the most common hereditary thrombophilia in the Caucasian population
(Table 6-5). More than 90% of patients with activated protein C resistance have the
G1691A mutation in the factor V gene (factor V Leiden), which decreases the rate of
proteolytic cleavage by activated protein C. Activated protein C resistance test
should be used for screening before obtaining factor V Leiden mutation genotype.
This test is performed by a clotting assay in which patient plasma is diluted in factor
V-deficient plasma; in a positive test, the addition of activated protein C fails to
cleave factor V, resulting in prolongation of PTT. Diagnosis is often confirmed by
detection of the factor V Leiden mutation by a DNA-based assay. The risk for VTE
in heterozygous patients who use oral contraceptives is increased 35-fold.
Prothrombin G20210A Mutation
The prothrombin G20210A mutation is a substitution mutation that results in
increased levels of plasma prothrombin, leading to increased generation of
thrombin. Assays of prothrombin time or prothrombin antigen are neither specific
nor sensitive enough for diagnosis; therefore, diagnosis is made by genotype
analysis.
Antithrombin Deficiency
Antithrombin is a plasma protease inhibitor that irreversibly binds and
neutralizes thrombin and factors Xa, IXa, and XIa, resulting in reversal of
coagulation cascade. This reaction is accelerated by heparin. Therefore,
antithrombin deficiency increases risk of thrombosis. Antithrombin deficiency is
relatively rare but is considered one of the more severe thrombophilias.

114

Type I antithrombin deficiency is characterized by both decreased levels and
decreased activity, whereas type II is characterized by decreased protease activity,
with defects in either the active center or the heparin-binding site. Thus, resistance
to the anticoagulant effects of heparin is seen in some patients. There is no difference
in clinical severity between type I and type II.
Antithrombin activity assays and antigen levels are used to make the diagnosis.
Acute thrombosis, heparin, liver disease, DIC, nephrotic syndrome, and
preeclampsia can all decrease antithrombin levels; therefore, diagnosis should not
be made on the basis of levels obtained under these conditions.
Prospective studies indicate that the incidence of VTE in these patients is 4%
per year. Nearly 70% of patients present with the first thrombotic event before age
35 years.
Protein C and S Deficiency
Proteins C and S are vitamin K-dependent endogenous anticoagulants.
115

Homozygous protein C deficiency can cause neonatal purpura fulminans. Patients
with either protein C or protein S deficiency can present with warfarin skin necrosis
at the initiation of anticoagulation due to a transient hypercoagulable state.
Protein C deficiency is diagnosed by an assay to detect activity followed by
immunoassays to differentiate type I (reduced antigen and activity) and type II
(reduced activity) defects. Protein S binds to a plasma protein so that free protein S
antigen and activity are used to screen for protein S deficiency and differentiate
among type I (decreased antigen and activity), type II (decreased activity), and type
III (low free protein S). DNA-based assays are not practical in both protein C and
protein S deficiency, given that >150 mutations in the protein C gene have been
described. Protein C and S levels are affected by liver disease, anticoagulation with
warfarin, nephrotic syndrome, DIC, vitamin K deficiency, oral contraceptives,
pregnancy, and hormone replacement therapy.
Elevated Factor VIII Levels
Increased factor VIII levels have been associated with an increased risk of
thrombosis (relative risk = 4.8). Elevated levels are found with increased age,
obesity, pregnancy, surgery, inflammation, liver disease, hyperthyroidism, and
diabetes. No gene alteration has been found, although familial clustering of
increased factor VIII levels is noted. It is unclear how increased factor VIII levels
lead to increased thrombotic risk and how elevated factor VIII levels may affect
treatment of thromboembolism.
Hereditary Thrombotic Dysfibrinogenemia
Dysfibrinogenemias are qualitative defects in the fibrin molecule. Multiple
genetic defects have been described. These defects lead to VTE in 20% of patients
and bleeding tendency in 25% of patients, but they are asymptomatic in 55%.
Normal or low levels of fibrinogen and a prolonged thrombin time may be observed.
This disorder is rare, and testing for it in patients with suspected thrombophilia is
considered low priority.
Diagnosis

Screening for thrombophilia should be done only in a carefully selected
population rather than all patients with first onset of VTE. There are few
clinical trial data available to guide the management of symptomatic or
asymptomatic thrombophilic patients in different clinical scenarios.
Consequently, there is debate about which patients should be screened.
Screening symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals and their family
members for the presence of thrombophilia has both benefits and
116

drawbacks. Benefits include a focus on prophylaxis with anticoagulant
therapy during high-risk situations, such as surgery, immobilization, and
pregnancy to prevent a first-time event and an awareness of increased
risk associated with oral contraceptive use, pregnancy, and hormone
replacement therapy. Drawbacks may include difficul-ties in obtaining life
insurance coverage and overanticoagulation, with exposure to
unnecessary bleeding risk. Universal screening, even for women
considering hormonal therapy, oral contraceptives, or pregnancy, is not
currently recommended, as it is not cost-effective and may deny women
birth control options.
Consideration of a hypercoagulable workup is usually
recommended in patients with
Recurrent VTE, especially unprovoked thrombosis
Thrombosis at a young age (< 50 years)
Thrombosis at unusual sites (cerebral sinus, mesenteric vein, portal
vein, hepatic vein)
Recurrent second or third trimester fetal loss, placental abruption, or
severe preeclampsia
The optimal time for testing patients for hereditary defects is not
well defined, but performing the thrombophilic evaluation at the time of
thrombosis is not advised because it often leads to misleading results. As
discussed above, acute thrombosis can cause low levels of antithrombin,
protein C, and protein S. Therapy with heparin reduces antithrombin
levels, and warfarin reduces protein C and S levels. Therefore, it is
usually recommended to test (if needed) at the time when patient is off
anticoagulation for several weeks without recent thrombosis.
Treatment
There are few clinical trial data to provide evidence-based recommendations for
the duration of anticoagulation in patients with hereditary thrombophilia.
Many experts would recommend a longer duration of
anticoagulation in patients with
Active cancer
Multiple allelic abnormalities
Antithrombin deficiency
Protein C or S deficiency
117

More then one thrombotic event
Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome
Some experts recommend lifelong anticoagulation for ptients with
Two or more unprovoked VTEs
Unprovoked VTE with antithrombin deficiency
Multiple genetic abnormalities
One life-threatening VTE
In all patients with a history of a thromboembolic event, regardless of
the presence or absence of hereditary thrombophilias, prophylaxis should
be pursued with unfractionated heparin or LMWH during high-risk
situations, including surgery, trauma, and immobilization. Women should
also be advised of the increased risk of recurrent thrombotic events with
oral contraceptives, hormone replacement therapy, and pregnancy.

ARTERIAL THROMBOEMBOLISM

General Principles

Definition

Arterial thromboses are those that lodge in the arterial side of the circulatory
system. There are two types:
In situ thrombosis due to a damaged artery (e.g., by trauma, vasculitis,
or foreign body)
Embolization from a proximal source (e.g., from the atria in atrial
fibrillation, a ventricular or arterial aneurysm, a proximal clot formed in
an area of damaged artery, or a venous clot that passes into the arterial
circulation through a heart defect)
Etiology

Possible hypercoagulable states leading to arterial thrombosis include
hyperhomocysteinemia, antiphospholipid syndrome, HIT, myeloproliferative
disorders, and paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria. Of note, these disorders may
present with either venous or arterial thrombosis.
118

Risk Factors

moking
Hypertension
Atherosclerosis
Turbulent blood flow
Diabetes
Chronic inflammation
Hyperlipidemia
Hypercoagulable state
Diagnosis

Clinical Presentation

The symptoms are typically related to the acute ischemia of the organ in which
the clot forms or lodges.
Treatment
The initial management of an arterial thrombus includes a search for either its
source as an embolus from a distant site or its origin as a clot that formed in situ.
The presence of a hypercoagulable state as the etiology of the arterial thrombus may
be considered if there are no readily identifiable risk factors.
Special Considerations
Hyperhomocysteinemia18
General Principles
Homocysteine is an intermediate formed in the metabolism of methionine.
Elevated levels of homocysteine are associated with arterial and venous thrombosis.
Hyperhomocysteinemia can be due to inheritance of enzyme defects involved in the
homocysteine metabolic pathways or can be acquired. Severe
hyperhomocysteinemia (plasma levels > 100 μmol/L) is most commonly due to
defects in cystathionine B-synthase, which results in homocystinuria, mental
119

retardation, and thromboses at a young age. The most common genetic defect in mild
homocysteinemia (plasma levels, 15 to 40 μmol/L) results in reduced activity of the
enzyme methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase. Prospective studies show that the
relative risk for VTE in patients with hyperhomocysteinemia is 3.4.
Acquired causes
Vitamin B 12, vitamin B 6, and folate deficiencies
Chronic renal failure
Hypothyroidism
Cancer
Increasing age
Smoking
Inflammatory bowel disease
Psoriasis
Rheumatoid arthritis
Methotrexate, phenytoin, and theophylline
The diagnosis is made by measuring fasting homocysteine plasma
levels.
Treatment
Patients deficient in folate, vitamin B6, or vitamin B12 can be supplemented with
these vitamins at sufficient doses to achieve normal levels. In the absence of specific
deficiencies, plasma homocysteine levels can be reduced by up to 50% by
administration of folate at doses of 1 to 2 mg/d, although it is uncertain whether this
ultimately leads to a decreased frequency of adverse events. In patients with severe
hyperhomocysteinemia due to cystathionine B-synthase deficiency, treatment with
vitamin B supplements improves homocysteine levels and delays thrombotic events.
In several recent studies, patients with first-time events, either arterial (stroke,
myocardial infarction [MI]) or VTE, treated with vitamin supplementation had
reductions in homocysteine levels but no protection from recurrent MI, recurrent
venous thrombosis, or progression of peripheral vascular disease. Therefore, the
role of homocysteine in thrombosis is still debated.
Antiphospholipid Syndrome19
General Principles
Antiphospholipid syndrome is characterized by recurrent venous or arterial
thrombosis and/or recurrent pregnancy morbidity/fetal loss and the presence of
antiphospholipid antibodies (anticardiolipin antibodies, lupus anticoagulants, antiB2-glycoprotein 1). Antiphospholipid antibodies are autoantibodies that recognize
phospholipids and/or phospholipid-binding proteins. Lupus anticoagulants are IgG
or IgM antibodies that react with negatively charged phospholipids. In vitro they act
120

as anticoagulants and interfere with membrane surfaces in clotting assays, resulting
in false prolongation of the aPTT and, rarely, the PT. The pathogenesis of
antiphospholipid antibodies is thought to involve the binding and subsequent
activation of endothelial cells, platelets, and complement to promote thrombosis and
the inhibition of the fibrinolytic pathway.
The syndrome is considered primary if there is no accompanying autoimmune
disease and secondary if the patient has systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).
Clinical Presentation
Approximately 30% to 50% of patients develop DVT of the legs within 6 years
of follow-up. Although venous thrombosis is more common, patients may present
with arterial occlusions, the most frequent involving the brain, followed by coronary
occlusions. Any vessel or vascular bed may be involved and diverse presentations,
such as intestinal, pancreatic, or splenic infarction; ARDS; retinitis; and acute renal
failure, may occur. Other features occasionally seen include thrombocytopenia,
hemolytic anemia, and livedo reticularis. Catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome,
characterized by multiple simultaneous thromboses, occurs in <1% of patients and is
associated with multiorgan failure and death.
Diagnosis relies on meeting at least one of the clinical and one of the
laboratory criteria as below.
Clinical
One or more episodes of venous, arterial, or small vessel thrombosis
Pregnancy morbidity—at least one unexplained death of a
morphologically normal fetus beyond the 10th week of gestation; at
least three unexplained spontaneous abortions before the 10th week of
gestation; or one or more premature births secondary to eclampsia,
preeclampsia, or placental insufficiency before the 34th week of
gestation
Laboratory
Lupus anticoagulant present on two or more occasions at least
12 weeks apart. The presence of the lupus anticoagulant may be
confirmed with the dilute Russell’s viper venom assay or phospholipid
neutralization assay.
Anticardiolipin antibody of IgG or IgM isotype presents at medium or
high titer on two or more occasions at least 12 weeks apart.
Anti-B2 - glycoprotein 1 of IgG or IgM isotype presents on two or
more occasions at least 12 weeks apart. Anticardiolipin and anti-B2 glycoprotein 1 are detected by immunologic assays.
Treatment
121

The treatment of antiphospholipid syndrome is lifelong anticoagulation,
typically with warfarin, with the goal INR 2.0 to 3.0. Hydroxychloroquine and ASA
may be used as adjunct therapy. Plasma exchange and rituximab have been used to
treat patients with catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome, although these
approaches are based on case studies and not on clinical trials.

GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Coagulopathy refers to disorders with excessive bleeding because of alterations
of proteins involved in the coagulation pathway. It can be divided into two main
categories: hereditary and acquired.
Hereditary
von Willebrand disease (vWD)
Hemophilia A
Hemophilia B
Acquired
Liver disease
Vitamin K deficiency
Disseminated intravascular coagulation
Acquired inhibitors of coagulation

HEREDITARY COAGULOPATHY

VON WILLEBRAND DISEASE (vWD)

GENERAL PRINCIPLES

124

vWD is caused by quantitative or qualitative abnormalities of von Willebrand
factor (vWF), resulting in disorders of primary and secondary hemostasis. The usual
inheritance pattern of vWD is autosomal dominant; incomplete penetrance may lead
to phenotypic variability. The incidence is ~1 in 100 to 400.
Classification1
The subtypes of vWD are presented in Table 7-1.
Pathophysiology
vWF is a glycoprotein synthesized by endothelial cells and platelets. It is stored
in the Weibel-Palade bodies of endothelial cells as well as platelet alpha granules.
vWF plays a role in both primary and secondary hemostasis. It mediates the
adhesion of platelets at sites of vascular injury, and it stabilizes and transports factor
VIII (FVIII) in the circulation. vWF is synthesized as a 300-kD monomer, which then
assembles into multimers of various sizes. The largest multimers mediate platelet
adhesion.

125

DIAGNOSIS2,3

Clinical Presentation

Recurrent mucocutaneous bleeding
Prolonged bleeding after trauma or surgery
126

Family history of a bleeding disorder is common.
In contrast to hemophilia, musculoskeletal bleeding is rare.
Although the majority of affected patients have mild vWD and minor
bleeding, patients with the most severe form may suffer life-threatening
hemorrhage.
Differential Diagnosis

Hemophilia A
Diagnostic Testing

Laboratories (see Chap. 5 for details)

CBC
PT (usually normal), aPTT (can be slightly prolonged)
Quantitative vWF antigen (vWF:Ag)
Qualitative vWF assay: Ristocetin cofactor assay (vWF:RCof) and/or vWF
collagen-binding assay (vWF:CBA)
Factor VIII level
vWF multimer assay
Ristocetin-induced platelet aggregation (RIPA) analysis
Factor VIII–binding ELISA
vWF levels vary with physiological stress, estrogen levels, and other
medical comorbidities, therefore levels should be repeated for
confirmation.

TREATMENT4
DDAVP (Desmopressin)5
Mechanism of action: Analog of antidiuretic hormone (vasopressin) that
lacks vasoactive properties. It acts by releasing endothelial stores of
vWF, thereby transiently increasing plasma levels of FVIII and vWF by a
factor of 3 to 5 within 30 to 60 minutes of administration.
127

Dosage: 0.3 μg/kg IV or SC or 300 μg intranasally
Dosing frequency: 8 to 10 hours (guided by the half-life of FVIII after
DDAVP administration)
DDAVP should not be used in patients with unstable coronary artery
disease, due to concern for ultra large vWF multimer-mediated platelet
aggregation in regions of high shear stress near atherosclerotic plaques.
At the time of vWD diagnosis or before elective treatment, a test dose of
DDAVP should be administered to establish the individual pattern of
response. FVIII levels and vWF:RCof should be measured at 1 and 4
hours after drug administration to determine peak factor levels and
clearance rate.
FVIII and vWF concentrates
The primary treatment for all vWD subtypes when significant bleeding or
major surgery is involved
Virus-inactivated FVIII + vWF concentrates, such as Humate-P and
Alphanate, are the products of choice, when available.
FVIII levels should be obtained every 12 hours on the day concentrates
are administered and every 24 hours thereafter. Target FVIII levels are
similar to those detailed for hemophilia A, below.
Cryoprecipitate, which contains 5 to 10 times more FVIII and vWF than
fresh-frozen plasma, can also be used, although techniques of virus
inactivation are not routinely applied to this product.
Platelet transfusion can be useful, especially when hemorrhage is not
controlled despite adequate FVIII levels after FVIII and vWF
concentrates.
Antifibrinolytic amino acids (aminocaproic acid, tranexamic acid)

HEMOPHILIA A6,7

GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Hemophilia A is an inherited coagulation disorder caused by alterations of the
gene encoding FVIII, leading to impaired intrinsic pathway function (see Figure 5-1
for intrinsic pathway). The inheritance pattern is X-linked recessive; the gene that
encodes FVIII is located on the long arm of the X chromosome (Xq28). Thirty
128

percent of cases are the result of spontaneous mutations. The incidence is
approximately 1 in 5000 live male births among all ethnic groups.

DIAGNOSIS

Clinical Presentation

Joint and muscle/soft tissue hemorrhages, easy bruising.
Prolonged bleeding after trauma or surgery; however, usually no
excessive bleeding after minor cuts or abrasions.
Chronic disability can result from hemarthrosis-induced arthropathy and
intramuscular bleeding.
Diagnostic Criteria

Laboratory evaluations include
Platelet count—normal
PT—normal
PTT—prolonged
PTT mixing study—correct with normal plasma
FVIII level—decreased (confirmation of diagnosis)
von Willebrand factor (vWF) level—normal
Genetic analysis is used for carrier detection and prenatal diagnosis.
Disease severity depends on FVIII level
Mild disease—level > 5% of normal
Moderate disease—levels 1% to 5% of normal
Severe disease— ≤1% of normal
Differential Diagnosis

Hemophilia B
von Willebrand disease (vWD) type 2N

129

TREATMENT6
Factor VIII replacement
Used in severe hemophilia, for both major and minor bleeding.
Options consist of recombinant FVIII (agent of choice) or purified, virusattenuated FVIII concentrates from pooled plasma.
Dosage: Each unit/kg of FVIII replacement will raise the plasma FVIII
level by 2%. Therefore, the bolus dose = target FVIII level (as below) ×
weight (kg) × 0.5.
Target FVIII level:
minor bleeding: ≥30%
more severe bleeding (e.g., muscle and joint hemorrhages): ≥ 50%
surgical procedures or life-threatening bleeding: ≥80%
The half life of FVIII is 8 to 12 hours, therefore, following a loading dose,
repeat doses are administered every 8 to 12 hours, adjusted to
measured factor VIII levels.
FVIII replacement can also be provided by continuous infusion.
Therapy should continue until hemostasis is achieved.
Postoperative therapy is usually continued for 10 to 14 days. Measuring
peak and trough FVIII levels after the first and selected subsequent
doses permits dose adjustments to ensure cost-effective therapy.
Recombinant factor VIIa8
Recombinant factor VIIa promotes hemostasis by activating the extrinsic
pathway.
It is currently approved for use in hemophilia A and B patients who have
developed inhibitors to FVIII or factor IX (FIX).
Dosage: 90 μg/kg every 2 to 3 hours until hemostasis is achieved.
DDAVP (Desmopressin)
Used in patients with mild disease (FVIII level > 5%) and minor
bleeding episodes
Details as outlined above for vWD

COMPLICATIONS
Infection from factor concentrates
130

Antibody formation, primarily in patients with severe factor deficiency9
Thrombosis
Hemophilic arthropathy
Recurrent hemorrhage into one or more joints leading to chronic
effusion, joint space narrowing, limited range of motion, atrophy of
adjacent musculature, and end stage arthritis
Can be prevented by prophylactic factor infusions (three times a week
for FVIII), intraarticular steroid injection, synovectomy, joint
replacement.

HEMOPHILIA B (TABLE 7-2)

ACQUIRED COAGULOPATHIES

LIVER DISEASE10
All coagulation factors, with the exception of vWF and possibly FVIII, are
produced in the liver. Liver dysfunction leads to a number of coagulation
abnormalities secondary to decreased factor synthesis, decrease clearance of
activated factors, dysregulation of fibrinolytic pathways, and production of abnormal
fibrinogen. The coagulopathy of liver disease is usually stable unless the liver
synthetic function is rapidly worsening, such as in fulminant hepatic failure. Patients
with liver synthetic dysfunction frequently also have thrombocytopenia secondary to
portal hypertension and splenic sequestration.

131

VITAMIN K DEFICIENCY
Vitamin K is a fat-soluble vitamin involved in the posttranslational
modification of procoagulant factors II, VII, IX, and X, and anticoagulant
proteins C and S. These reactions take place in the liver, where vitamin
K serves as a cofactor for the conversion of glutamic acid residues to
gamma-carboxyglutamic acid, which facilitates binding of coagulation
factors to phospholipid, an essential step in coagulation. Vitamin K must
then be recycled by vitamin K epoxide reductase (VKOR) for further
gamma-carboxylation to occur. It follows that vitamin K deficiency would
132

render these so-called vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors
ineffective.
Disorders of vitamin K most commonly results from the use of warfarin, a
VKOR inhibitor. Other causes of Vitamin K deficiency are inadequate
dietary intake, which may deplete vitamin K stores in as little as 7 days,
malabsorption syndromes, or use of antibiotics, which can eliminate
vitamin K–producing bowel flora.
Vitamin K deficiency results in prolonged PT that corrects during mixing
studies.
Vitamin K repletion may be provided PO, SC, or IV. PO is the preferred
route. IV vitamin K is effective but carries the risk of anaphylaxis. To
minimize this risk, vitamin K may be diluted in a dextrose or saline
solution and slowly administered via an infusion pump. If bleeding is
significant or does not respond to vitamin K therapy, factor replacement
in the form of fresh-frozen plasma should be administered.

DISSEMINATED INTRAVASCULAR COAGULATION11
DIC is a hemostatic derangement of multiple etiologies characterized by smalland medium-vessel thrombosis with consumption of platelets and coagulation
factors. It leads to microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and
coagulation abnormalities (see Chap. 4).

ACQUIRED INHIBITORS OF COAGULATION
Acquired inhibitors of coagulation are immunoglobulins, usually IgG, which
exert their effects by inhibiting the activity or increasing the clearance of coagulation
factors. They can be directed against any of the coagulation factors, with inhibitors
of FVIII being most common. Inhibitors of coagulation can occur in the following
settings:
Extensive blood product exposure in patients with inherited factor
deficiency, most commonly in hemophilia A
Lymphoproliferative malignancies
Autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis or lupus
Drug reactions
Postpartum
133

Inhibitors cause prolongation of the PT, the aPTT, or both. If the abnormal
coagulation studies do not correct with mixing, an inhibitor is likely, and the
Bethesda assay can be run to quantify the inhibitor (see Chap. 5 for details). If
antiphospholipid antibodies are suspected, a source of phospholipids (such as dilute
Russell’s viper venom) can be added to mixed plasma. Correction of the abnormal
coagulation tests suggests the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies (see Chap. 6
for more information on antiphospholipid syndrome).
Patients may present with bleeding diathesis, which can be severe and life
threatening. Treatment varies depending on the type of inhibitor and severity of
bleeding. Therapeutic options include recombinant factor VIIa, immunosuppression
with corticosteroids and/or cyclophosphamide, plasma exchange, and intravenous
immunoglobulin.

GENERAL PRINCIPLES

Pancytopenia is a reduction in all blood cell lines, including red
blood cells (RBCs), white blood cells (WBCs), and platelets. Patients can
present in innumerable ways depending on the severity and type of cell
lineages affected. Anemia can cause fatigue, shortness of breath, or
lightheadedness. Patients with significant thrombocytopenia can present
with bleeding and bruising. Neutropenia is associated with recurrent
infections. Cytopenias may result from defects in bone marrow
production or from peripheral causes.
Bone marrow infiltration by disease processes such lymphoma,
metastatic carcinoma, sarcoidosis, tuberculosis, myeloma, hairy cell
leukemia, or in storage disorders (e.g., Gaucher, Niemann–Pick) can
result in inadequate production. Vitamin B12 and/or folate deficiency
leads to megaloblastic erythropoiesis and defective maturation of
granulocytic and megakaryocytic lineages. Copper deficiency is a
relatively uncommon cause of pancytopenia.
Causes of increased destruction of blood cells in the periphery include
hyper-splenism, autoimmune diseases and overwhelming sepsis.
Medications may also affect blood counts. For example, antipsychotics
such as clozapine are known to cause agranulocytosis. Impaired
production of blood cells is seen in bone marrow failure states, both
inherited and acquired. Bone marrow failure is defined as the inability
of the bone marrow to produce an adequate number of circulating blood
cells. Inherited BM failure syndromes are as described in Table 8-1.1
Acquired bone marrow failure states include myelodysplastic syndromes
136

(MDS), acquired aplastic anemia (AA), and paroxysmal nocturnal
hemoglobinuria (PNH).
In most cases, initial laboratory evaluation should include a complete
blood count, serum chemistries, peripheral smear and reticulocyte count.
If clinically indicated, an evaluation of the patient’s folate and B12 status,
or an infectious workup (including HIV, hepatitis panel, other viral or
fungal serologies) should be undertaken. If an etiology is not apparent, a
bone marrow biopsy and aspirate should be obtained. In cases where a
hematologic malignancy is suspected, flow cytometry and cytogenetics
performed on the aspirate may be useful.
Treatment and further laboratory or imaging evaluations will depend on
the etiology of the cytopenia(s). In cases where a medication is the
underlying cause, discontinuation of the offending drug may be curative.
Cytopenias resulting from bone marrow infiltration or suppression by
other conditions may improve with treatment of the underlying condition.
Cytopenias resulting from nutritional deficiencies can be treated by
addressing the underlying nutritional deficiencies. In cases where bone
marrow failure is the etiology of the cytopenias, treatment will depend
on the diagnosis. Features and management of selected bone marrow
failure syndromes are described in the following sections.

137

MYELODYSPLASTIC SYNDROMES

GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Myelodysplastic syndromes are neoplastic clonal stem cell disorders
characterized by cytopenias and most commonly a hypercellular, dysplasticappearing bone marrow. Peripheral blood features include monocytosis, Pelger
Huet-like anomaly in neutrophils, circulating immature myeloid or erythroid cells,
and macrocytosis. In MDS, the bone marrow is typically hypercellular with
“megaloblastoid changes,” atypical megakaryocytes, erythroid hyperplasia, and
defective maturation in the myeloid series. Increased blasts or ringed sideroblasts
can also be seen. Despite increased cell proliferation, there is also increased
apoptosis, leading to the discrepancy between the cellular bone marrow and
peripheral cytopenias.
Epidemiology

MDS is considered a disease of the elderly. Approximately 80% of patients are
older than 60 years of age at diagnosis. The annual incidence rate of MDS in the
United States is estimated to be 3.4/100,000. The median age at diagnosis is 76
years, with only 6% of cases diagnosed before age 50.2 Risk factors include
exposure to chemotherapy (especially alkylating agents and topoisomerase II
inhibitors), chloramphenicol, radiation, benzene and other solvents, petroleum
products, smoking, and immunosuppression. Inherited bone marrow failure
syndromes are the primary risk factor for MDS in the pediatric age group.
Classification

The World Health Organization’s (WHO’s) International Agency for Research
on Cancer (IARC) revised its classification of MDS in 2008. The revised
classification is shown in Table 8-2.3 Therapy-related MDS (tMDS) refers to
138

MDS that arises after exposure to chemotherapy agents. tMDS occurs most
frequently in patients diagnosed with tumors that are associated with a good
prognosis, such as breast cancer, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, Hodgkin lymphoma, and
testicular cancer. For instance, 1.7% of patients with breast cancer develop
secondary bone marrow disease, with a mean time of 18 months. tMDS and acute
myelogenous leukemia (AML) occur in about 5% to 10% of patients with Hodgkin’s
lymphoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. tMDS differs from sporadic MDS in that it
tends to be associated with distinct chromosomal abnormalities. tMDS after
exposure to alkylating agents is associated with deletions of chromosome 5 or 7 and
occurs 3 to 5 years after therapy. Topoisomerase II inhibitors, such as daunorubicin,
etoposide, and tenoposide, cause tMDS/AML with translocations involving the MLL
gene at chromosome 11q23, usually manifesting 1 to 3 years after treatment.
Pathophysiology

Patients with MDS exhibit cytopenia(s) despite a cellular bone marrow.
Chromosomal analysis suggests that MDS is a clonal disorder. The critical genetic
lesions that initiate MDS are not well-characterized. The cytopenias seen in MDS
are thought to arise from ineffective hematopoiesis arising from abnormal responses
to cytokine growth factors, defects in the bone marrow microenvironment, and
impaired cell survival.

139

DIAGNOSIS

Clinical Presentation

MDS is clinically a heterogeneous disorder. Its clinical manifestations result
from marrow failure and cytopenia(s). Sometimes, the diagnosis is made
retrospectively after transformation to acute leukemia. Lymph node involvement and
hepatosplenomegaly are rare.
140

Diagnostic Testing

In the absence of other causes, marrow failure (as evidenced by cytopenias) with
bone marrow findings of normal or increased cellularity with dysplastic myeloid
cells is a cornerstone in establishing the diagnosis of MDS. The CBC often reveals
cytopenias, and an elevated mean corpuscular volume. Reticulocyte count is
inappropriately low. Peripheral blood smear may show oval macrocytic red cells,
hypogranular neutrophils, and giant platelets.
Bone marrow biopsy is essential in the diagnostic evaluation. The
cellularity is usually normal or increased, although it can be hypocellular.
Dysplastic morphological changes may not be present in all patients with
MDS, and the subjectivity of the findings may pose a significant
diagnostic challenge. Morphological abnormalities include megaloblastic
red cell precursors with multiple nuclei and asynchronous maturation of
the nucleus or cytoplasm. Ringed sideroblasts (erythroid precursors with
iron-laden mitochondria) are occasionally identified. There is often a
predominance of immature myeloid cells, and granulocytic precursors
may show asynchronous maturation of the nucleus and cytoplasm.
Mature granulocytes are often hypogranular and hypolobulated.
Megakaryocytes may be smaller and have fewer nuclear lobes.
Recurrent cytogenetic abnormalities are present in 40% to 70% in
de novo MDS and 95% of tMDS. In cases where the clinical and
laboratory features are consistent with MDS but the morphological
features are ambiguous, a presumptive diagnosis of MDS can be made if
a specific clonal chromosomal abnormality (Table 8-3) is present.4
Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) is becoming an important
diagnostic tool in the evaluation of MDS. Unlike cytogenetics, which can
be performed only in mitotic cells, FISH can be performed in mitotic cells
as well as cells in interphase. It also has the advantage of providing
quick results and has a high sensitivity and specificity. It can detect
clonal cryptic defects in about 3% to 15% of MDS patients with normal
cytogenetics, and may detect chromosomal abnormalities earlier in the
course of the disease. However, FISH will only detect what is being
looked for and hence cannot replace cytogenetics.
TREATMENT

141

The Federal Drug Administration (FDA) has recently approved four drugs for
the treatment of MDS patients: the hypomethylating agents 5-azacytidine (azaC) and
decitabine; the immunomodulator lenalidomide for patients with del (5q) subtype;
and deferasirox, an iron chelator for treating chronic iron overload resulting from
multiple transfusions. Supportive treatment with transfusions and growth factors is
also part of MDS management. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant
(HSCT) is the primary curative treatment for patients with MDS. Features to
consider for HSCT include patient’s age, IPSS (International Prognostic Scoring
System) score, performance status, comorbidities, and availability of a suitable
donor. Higher-risk patients ≤60 years of age should be offered a human leukocyte
antigen (HLA) identical sibling transplant at diagnosis (if otherwise feasible),
whereas delaying transplantation for several years and prior to disease progression
would be appropriate for lower-risk patients. In patients who require reduction of
their disease burden prior to HSCT, azaC, decitabine, or participation in clinical
trials can be used as bridges to transplant.5 The role of reduced-intensity regimens in
patients of advanced age or with other comorbidities remains to be determined.

Lower-risk MDS
For patients with lower-risk MDS, treatment is aimed at reducing transfusions,
142

restoring effective blood cell production and maximizing quality of life. For lowerrisk MDS patients with symptomatic anemia, treatment follows one of several
pathways. In patients with MDS del(5q), lenalidomide, a derivative of thalidomide,
is the treatment of choice. In this population, 70% experience transfusion
independence or a decline in transfusion needs when treated with lenalidomide.
Lenalidomide, like thalidomide, inhibits angiogenesis, alters cellular immune
responses, modulates various cytokines, and has direct antileukemic,
antiproliferative effects. In addition, lenalidomide also enhances erythropoietin
(EPO) receptor signaling. It is more potent and has a favorable side-effect profile
compared to thalidomide. Its dose-limiting side effects include neutropenia and
thrombocytopenia.
In other lower-risk MDS patients lacking del(5q), erythropoiesis
stimulating agents (ESAs), which include epoetin and darbepoetin, may
be appropriate. Patients with low transfusion needs, defined as <2 units
of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) monthly, and a low baseline serum
erythropoietin level (<500 IU) have a 74% chance of responding to
ESAs. Consequently, ESAs, with or without granulocyte colony
stimulating factor (GCSF), are appropriate initial treatment for these
patients.
On the other hand, patients with higher transfusion needs (≥2 units of
PRBCs) and high serum erythropoietin level (≥500 IU) have only a 7%
chance of responding to ESAs. Patients with age ≤60 years, hypocellular
marrows, HLA-DR15 histocompatibility type, or PNH clone positivity,
have a good probability of responding to immunosuppressive therapy
(IST) with antithymocyte globulin (ATG) or cyclosporin A. Those who are
deemed unlikely to respond to IST should be treated with
hypomethylating agents. Lenalidomide can also be considered.
Higher-risk MDS
For patients with higher-risk MDS, the goals of treatment are similar to patients
with AML, and include attaining a partial or complete remission, prolonging
survival and also maximizing quality of life if patients are candidates for highintensity therapy, allogeneic HSCT is recommended if a suitable donor can be
identified. Patients without a suitable donor should be treated with a
hypomethylating agent such as azaC or decitabine, or high intensity chemotherapy.
For higher-risk MDS patients who are not candidates for high-intensity therapy,
treatment with hypomethylating agents is appropriate.
PROGNOSIS
143

Evolution to AML occurs in 10% to 50% of all cases of MDS; it varies with the
MDS subtypes and correlates with the survival duration. The IPSS for MDS (Table
8-4) developed in 1997 continues to be one of the most widely used prognostic
tools, despite its shortcomings.6 It should be noted that the IPSS is only validated in
previously untreated patients. Furthermore, in 2001, the WHO changed the acute
leukemia-defining marrow blast threshold from 30% to 20%, making the IPSS
appear dated. Much debate revolves around the classification of the patients with
20% to 30% blasts, who appear to represent a heterogeneous group with
characteristics that differ from classic AML. The IPSS score does not take into
account the severity of cytopenias, and has been criticized for overemphasizing the
significance of marrow blast proportion while underemphasizing high-risk
karyotypic findings. Lower-risk MDS patients (RA, RARS, RCUD, RCMD, MDS-U
MDS del(5q), IPSS low or Int-1) have an estimated survival of 3 to 10 years.
Higher-risk MDS patients (RAEB-1 or RAEB-2, IPSS Int-2 or high) have an
estimated survival of <1.5 years, and a high rate of AML transformation.7

APLASTIC ANEMIAS

GENERALP RINCIPLES
Aplastic anemias (AA) refer to conditions in which normal hematopoietic tissue
is replaced by fat. They are characterized by pancytopenia and a hypocellular bone
marrow in the absence of bone marrow infiltration and increased reticulin
deposition. AA can be acquired or arise in the context of an inherited bone marrow
failure syndrome. AA can coexist with other conditions such as PNH (discussed in
the next section) and T-cell large granular lymphocyte (T-LGL) disease.
Approximately 40% to 50% of patients with acquired AA have expanded
populations of PNH cells.8

144

Epidemiology

Acquired AA is a rare disease. The incidence is estimated to be about two cases
per million per year in Western countries, and about two- to threefold higher in
Asia. Almost half of the cases occur during the first 3 decades of life.8
Classification

AA can be acquired or inherited. Table 8-1 outlines several forms of inherited
AA.1 In the presence of an empty marrow, pancytopenia, and transfusion
dependence, the severity of the disease is based on the absolute neutrophil count
(ANC). In nonsevere AA, the ANC is >0.5 × 109/L. In severe AA, the ANC is
between 0.2 and 0.5 × 10 9/L. In very severe AA, the ANC is <0.2 × 109/L.9
Etiology

The genetic aberrations associated with inherited bone marrow failure are listed
in Table 8-1. The rarity of acquired AA is accounted for by a combination of
infrequent exposure events, diversity of predisposing genetic factors, and individual
differences in immune response. Table 8-5 lists some of the factors thought to be
145

associated with acquired AA.10

Pathophysiology

The pathophysiology of acquired AA is an immune-mediated attack on the
hematopoietic stem cells in most cases, caused by activated cytotoxic T cells
bearing the Th1 profile. These activated T cells produce cytokines such as
interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α). Fas ligand
expression is induced by IFN-γ and TNF-α. Binding of Fas ligand to the Fas
receptor on hematopoietic stem cells could contribute to marrow aplasia by
146

triggering apoptosis. The reason for T cell activation remains unclear. It is possible
that an inciting event like an infection, toxin, or a drug exposure provokes the
aberrant immune response. HLA-DR2 is overexpressed in patients with AA. Recent
data also implicate intrinsic defects in hematopoietic stem cells. Mutations in the
genes for telomerase, TERC and TERT, have been described in patients without
overt clinical stigmata of dyskeratosis congenita. Telomere shortening is observed in
one third to one half of patients with AA. Accelerated telomere shortening may
result in premature death of rapidly proliferating cells.
DIAGNOSIS

Clinical Presentation

Patients with AA present with symptoms related to pancytopenia. The presence
of weight loss, pain, loss of appetite, or fever suggests another diagnosis. Physical
examination usually reveals pallor, mucosal bleeding, petechiae, and ecchymoses.
The presence of lymphadenopathy, hepatomegaly, or splenomegaly strongly suggests
another diagnosis such as lymphoma, leukemia, or bone marrow infiltration.
Diagnostic Testing

The diagnosis is established by bone marrow aspiration and biopsy. The
findings include a profoundly hypocellular marrow with a decrease in all cellular
elements, with marrow space being replaced by fat cells and stromal elements. The
residual hematopoietic elements are morphologically normal. There is no increased
reticulin formation or infiltrative elements. Evaluation for other etiologies of
pancytopenia includes viral serologies for hepatitis, CMV, EBV, parvovirus, HIV,
and herpes. Serum B12 and folate levels should be determined. As an underlying
cause of AA is Fanconi anemia (FA), even in adults without other classic features of
FA, diepoxybutane (DEB) or mitomyin C testing to exclude chromosome fragility
should be considered. Evaluation for the presence of a PNH clone is also part of the
workup. T-LGL, a rare condition characterized by an increase in the number of
circulating T cells bearing the CD57 activation marker of effector/cytotoxic T cells,
should be considered if increased large granular lymphocytes are noted on
examination of the peripheral blood smear or if the patient has a history of
rheumatoid arthritis.
TREATMENT

147

Management of AA includes supportive care as initial treatment to sustain an
acutely ill, pancytopenic patient. Immunosuppression and allogeneic HSCT are the
main therapeutic approaches.8,9
Supportive care. Patients with symptomatic anemia will need
transfusions. Patients with symptomatic thrombocytopenia or a platelet
count of <10,000 should be given platelets. Blood products should be
irradiated to prevent transfusion-associated GVHD. In patients who are
considered for stem cell transplantation, only CMV-negative products
should be administered to CMV IgG-negative patients, and blood
products from family members should be avoided to prevent
alloimmunization. EPO and myeloid factors are not used as a mainstay of
treatment. No significant survival in survival has been seen in patients
receiving G-CSF as compared to those who did not receive G-CSF.
Immunosuppression. ATG with cyclosporine is indicated as first-line
therapy for nonsevere AA patients who are transfusion dependent,
severe AA patients >40 years of age, and severe AA patients <40 years
of age who lack an HLA-identical sibling donor. Response to ATG occurs
in around 50% of patients by 3 months, and 70% to 75% by 6 months.
Relapses occur in up to 30% to 35% of patients when cyclosporine is
withdrawn at 6 months.
HSCT. Patients with severe AA <40 years of age with an HLA-matched
sibling donor should be offered HSCT as first-line treatment. The 5-year
survival is 77%. In children and minimally transfused patients, survival of
80% to 90% can be routinely achieved. Acute GVHD occurs in about
20% to 30% of patients. Chronic GVHD is a major cause of morbidity
and mortality in patients who survived more than 2 years post
transplantation, and life-long immunosuppression is often needed.
Chronic GVHD occurs in about 30% to 40% of patients. As a matched
sibling donor is available in only about 20% to 30% of cases, alternative
sources of hematopoietic stem cells have been sought. HSCT from
unrelated donor carries higher morbidity and mortality than HSCT from a
matched sibling donor, and are therefore reserved for patients who lack
a matched sibling donor and who failed to respond to one or more
rounds of immunosuppression.
PROGNOSIS

148

Without treatment, patients with severe or very severe AA will eventually
succumb to infections or hemorrhagic complications. Spontaneous remission can be
seen with drug-induced AA and usually occurs within 2 months of presentation.
Overall survival after immunosuppression for AA is approximately 75% at 5 years.
This equates with survival after HSCT. For patients treated with
immunosuppression, long-term follow-up data indicated an actuarial probability of
developing hemolytic PNH at 11 years of 10%, MDS or AML 8%, and a solid tumor
11%.

PAROXYSMAL NOCTURNAL HEMOGLOBINURIA

GENERAL PRINCIPLES
PNH is an acquired disease characterized by nonmalignant clonal expansion of
one or more hematopoietic stem cells that have undergone somatic mutation of the
PIG-A gene. PNH can present with bone marrow failure, hemolytic anemia, smooth
muscle dystonias, and thrombosis. PNH can arise de novo or in the setting of AA.11
Pathophysiology

The protein encoded by the PIG-A gene is essential for the synthesis of glycosyl
phosphatidylinositol (GPI), and therefore GPI-linked proteins are lacking in the PIGA mutant clone. PNH RBCs lack two GPI-anchored complement regulatory proteins,
CD55 and CD59. Hemolysis in PNH results from increased susceptibility of PNH
RBCs to complement-mediated destruction. Intravascular hemolysis releases free
hemoglobin into circulation. Free plasma hemoglobin scavenges nitric oxide (NO)
and the depletion of NO at the tissue level is postulated to account for multiple PNH
manifestations, including esophageal spasm, male erectile dysfunction, renal
insufficiency and thrombosis. The PNH clone is present in a considerable proportion
of the general population without symptoms. In patients with PNH, the clone is
expanded significantly. It is postulated that PNH patients have some degree of
marrow failure and the PNH clone is selectively protected from bone marrow injury
as result of the lack of GPI-linked proteins.
DIAGNOSIS

149

Clinical Presentation

The clinical manifestations of PNH are intravascular hemolytic anemia,
marrow failure, and thrombosis. Bone marrow failure can be transient, mild, or
severe. Thrombosis usually involves the venous system and occurs in about 40% of
PNH patients. Thrombosis can occur in unusual sites such as intra-abdominal veins.
The clinical course is unpredictable and patients can have spontaneous remissions.
PNH can present with or without evidence of another disorder such as AA or MDS.
Subclinical PNH (without clinical or laboratory evidence of hemolysis) can occur in
association with other bone marrow failure syndromes.
Diagnostic Testing

Flow cytometry using monoclonal antibodies against specific GPI-linked
proteins is the most sensitive and specific test to identify the PNH clone.
Fluorescein-labeled proaerolysin variant (FLAER) is increasingly used as a flow
cytometric assay to diagnose PNH. The hemolysis is intravascular (high reticulocyte
count, increased lactate dehydrogenase and unconjugated bilirubin, and decreased
haptoglobulin) and is Coombs negative. Iron studies are needed to evaluate for irondeficiency anemia, which can result from renal loss of hemoglobin. Bone marrow
biopsy is helpful in assessing for marrow failure.
TREATMENT
There are no clear evidence-based indications for treatment of PNH. For
asymptomatic patients or those with mild symptoms, watchful waiting is an
appropriate approach. For patients with underlying AA, treatment is directed toward
the underlying bone marrow failure. Indications for treatment in classic PNH
include disabling fatigue, thromboses, transfusion dependence, frequent pain
paroxysms, renal insufficiency, or other end-organ complications. Corticosteroids
can improve hemoglobin levels and reduce hemolysis in some PNH patients, but its
long-term use is limited because of toxicity. Complement inhibition and HSCT are
established effective therapies for PNH.
Complement inhibition. Eculizumab, a humanized monoclonal
antibody against complement C5, inhibits terminal complement
activation.12 It has been approved by the FDA for use in PNH. Eculizumab
is effective in decreasing intravascular hemolysis, need for blood
transfusions, and risk of thrombosis. Eculizumab is administered
150

intravenously at a dose of 600 mg weekly for the first 4 weeks, then 900
mg biweekly starting on week 5. It is well tolerated, but must be
continued indefinitely as it does not treat the underlying cause. Its
serious adverse effects include risk of infection by encapsulated
organisms. Patients receiving eculizumab should be vaccinated against
Neisseria meningitides prior to starting therapy.
HSCT. Allogeneic HSCT remain the only curative therapy for PNH, but it
is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Currently there is
no definite indication for transplantation. Patients with life-threatening
thrombosis and underlying severe BM failure should be considered for
transplantation.
Treatment of thrombosis. Thrombosis is a life-threatening
complication of PNH and should be treated promptly with
anticoagulation. However, anticoagulation is only partially effective in
preventing clots, and treatment with eculizumab should be strongly
considered in patients with thrombosis. The duration of anticoagulation
after initiation of eculizumab is controversial in these patients. Likewise,
the role of prophylactic anticoagulation in PNH is also controversial.
PROGNOSIS

The natural history of PNH is highly variable. Median survival is 10 to 15 years.
Thrombosis is the leading cause of death. Patients with PNH may also develop lifethreatening bone marrow failure, MDS, or leukemia. Patients with AA and a PNH
clone typically do not exhibit signs or symptoms of PNH early in the natural history
of their disease, but many will experience further expansion of the PIG-A mutant
clone and progress to classic PNH.

GENERAL PRINCIPLES
The myeloproliferative disorders (MPDs) are a group of clonal diseases
characterized by overproduction of mature, largely functional cells arising from the
transformation of a clonal hematopoietic stem cell. The World Health Organization
(WHO) has designated seven conditions as MPDs (Table 9-1). Philadelphia
chromosome-positive chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is discussed in the chapter
on leukemias (Chap. 29). Collectively, these disorders are uncommon. They share
the signs and symptoms of hepatosplenomegaly, hypercatabolism, clonal marrow
hyperplasia without dysplasia, and increased numbers of one or more cell lines.
They are typically indolent and chronic in nature but may evolve into acute leukemia.
Recent description of the activating Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) mutation V617F in many
of these disorders links them with a common pathophysiology. Although of clear
clinical importance, this mutation is still being incorporated into diagnostic,
prognostic, and treatment algorithms.

POLYCYTHEMIA VERA

GENERAL PRINCIPLES

Definition

Polycythemia vera (PV) is a monoclonal stem cell disease characterized by
proliferation of a multipotent stem cell with trilineage hyperplasia resulting
153

primarily in expansion of the RBC line. Recently, the activating JAK2 V617F
mutation has been noted in nearly all patients. JAK2 is an essential kinase in the
erythropoietin (EPO) receptor signal transduction pathway. Constitutive JAK2
kinase activity results in EPO-independent proliferation of erythrocyte precursors.
JAK2 is also involved in the JAK2-STAT5 pathways of the thrombopoietin (TPO)
receptor (Mpl) and the granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptor (GCSF-R).
The V617F mutation can thus lead to proliferation of multiple cell lines, and patients
with PV often have elevated platelets and leukocytes as well. 1
Epidemiology

PV is the most common of the MPDs, with an incidence of ~2 in 100,000 people.
The average age of PV patients is 60 years, but it occurs across all age groups, with
a male predominance. Although familial clustering does exist, it is uncommon, and
the JAK2 mutation is acquired somatically, suggesting a separate predisposition
pathway.

Etiology

Etiology is not clear but the following observations have been made:
Clonal cytogenetic abnormalities are associated with the disorder in
~30% of patients, mainly deletion of long arm of chromosome 20,
trisomy of chromo-some 8 or 9, or loss of heterozygosity on short arm of
chromosome 9. The JAK2 gene is located on the short arm of
chromosome 9.
154

Up to 97% of patients have an activating mutation in JAK2 (V617F),
which is also seen in other MPDs.
There is impaired post-translational processing of the TPO receptor, Mpl,
leading to decreased expression on platelets and megakaryocytes. Thus,
proliferation of platelet in PV may be independent of TPO.
BCL-XL, an apoptosis-inhibiting oncoprotein, is overexpressed in
erythroid cells.
Bone marrow shows erythroid progenitor cell proliferation in the absence
of EPO stimulation.
Risk Factors

None known.
Clinical Course

PV is a chronic disorder and may be characterized as having phases
during its course. The preerythrocytic phase is generally
asymptomatic, with an isolated increase in platelets or RBCs. Patients
may experience trivial pruritus and may have mild splenomegaly. This
progresses to the erythrocytic phase, characterized by erythrocytosis
requiring regular phlebotomy as well as increased granulocytes and
platelet counts. Splenomegaly, pruritus, thrombosis, and hemorrhage
may be present. This may last for a number of years. The spent
phaseis characterized by a reduced need for phlebotomy.
Thrombocytosis and leukocytosis persist, and splenomegaly is
progressive.
Up to 50% of patients may progress to a clinical picture difficult to
differentiate from that of idiopathic myelofibrosis. Anemia develops, and
the peripheral smear shows a leukoerythroblastic picture with teardrop
poikilocytes, nucleated red cells, and anisocytosis. Immature
granulocytes are seen, with a slight increase in basophils, and platelets
are often abnormal in morphology. Splenomegaly worsens, and there are
increased systemic symptoms. Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) may occur
in up to 20% of patients, and the risk is increased in patients treated
with alkylating agents. The incidence of progression to AML is higher in
patients with myelofibrosis.
Thrombotic risk is present throughout the course of PV and may be
155

linked to elevated, dysfunctional leukocytes or platelets. Reduction of
thrombotic risk is a mainstay of therapy, and recurrent thrombosis can
be common.
DIAGNOSIS

Clinical Presentation

Patients are often asymptomatic at presentation; however, they may present with
symptoms related to increased RBC mass and hyperviscosity. Symptoms may
include headache, weakness, peptic ulcer disease, hyperhydrosis, vision changes,
tinnitus, and vertigo. In addition, many patients experience pruritus, especially with
exposure to hot water. Erythromelalgia, due to microarteriolar occlusion, is
characterized by a burning sensation in the digits and may be severe. Patients are
also predisposed to thrombosis and, less often, hemorrhage. Many of these
symptoms have been attributed to hyperviscosity, but dysfunction of leukocytes and
platelets may also play an important role. Physical exam findings include
splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, hypertension, and plethora.
Diagnostic Criteria

The Polycythemia Vera Study Group established diagnostic criteria >30 years
ago. These are currently in flux, as they include neither EPO levels nor the JAK2
mutation. At Washington University, we have adopted the Campbell-proposed
criteria based on JAK2 status, with modifications of the Polycythemia Vera Study
Group criteria (Table 9-2).2 Patients with JAK2-positive PV have a hematocrit
>52% in men or >48% in women or an increased red cell mass (>25% above
predicted) and a documented mutation. Ninety-five percent to 97% of patients with
PV test positive either in exon 14 or in exon 12. Patients with suspected PV and
negative exon 14 V617F JAK2 mutation should be tested for JAK2 exon 12
mutations.3 JAK2-negative PV is much less common and should prompt a careful
examination for secondary causes of polycythemia.
Differential Diagnosis

Patients with secondary polycythemia typically have elevated EPO levels caused
by chronic hypoxemia, heavy smoking, renal disease, or malignancies such as renal
cell cancer, hepatocellular cancer, and hemangioblastoma. Rare conditions such as
156

congenital polycythemia with augmented hypoxia sensing and high–oxygen affinity
hemoglobin mutants should be considered. Relative polycythemia, or
pseudopolycythemia, is associated with a normal red cell mass and decreased
plasma volume secondary to causes such as dehydration, diuretics, and burns. In
cases of JAK2-negative polycythemia with low-normal EPO levels, BCR-ABL
rearrangements should be evaluated, as CML may present with many of the same
features.

Diagnostic Testing

The diagnosis is suspected when blood counts reveal an elevated
hematocrit (Hct). The EPO level is low (<20 mU/mL) and often
undetectable. The JAK2 V617F mutation is seen in nearly all patients.
Leukocyte alkaline phosphatase scores, vitamin B12, and uric acid levels
may be elevated but are nonspecific findings. These patients also have
an elevated RBC mass as demonstrated by 51 Cr labeling of RBCs and
157

isotope dilution, although this is rarely tested now. In addition, ~60% of
patients have elevated granulocyte counts, and 50% have
thrombocytosis.
The peripheral smear may show microcytic, hypochromic RBCs with
anisocytosis and poikilocytosis, reflecting exhaustion of iron stores due to
increased hemoglobin (Hgb) synthesis. WBCs generally have normal
morphology, but there are often increased basophils, eosinophils, and
immature forms. Platelets occasionally have an abnormal morphology,
with megathrombocytes seen on the smear.
Bone marrow biopsy findings are not diagnostic of PV, but biopsy is
frequently performed to evaluate fibrosis and cytogenetics even when
the diagnosis is not in question. Findings include hypercellular marrow
with trilineage hyperplasia and clustered megakaryocytes with
hypolobulated nuclei. Approximately 30% of PV patients will have an
abnormal karyotype. Common karyotype changes include trisomy 9
(amplification of JAK2), trisomy 8 (also found in other MPDs,
myelodysplastic syndrome, AML), trisomy 1q (unclear significance), del
5q and del 7q (more often seen after cytotoxic therapy), and del 13q
(also associated with idiopathic myelofibrosis and chronic lymphocytic
leukemia).
TREATMENT
The goals of treatment are to reduce the blood volume to normal and to prevent
thrombotic and hemorrhagic complications. Thrombotic risk has been associated
with an age >60 years, prior thrombosis, and a platelet count >1000 × 109/L.
Thrombocytosis clearly increases thrombotic risk, and this risk appears to be a
continuum, with increased risk starting at 400 × 109/L and peaking at 900 × 109/L.
Hemorrhagic risk increases with platelet counts >1500 × 109/L. Emerging risk
factors include leukocyte counts >15 × 109/L and cardiovascular factors such as
smoking, obesity, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes, and coronary artery
disease (Table 9-3).
Low-risk patients are <60 years old and have no history of
thrombosis, no cardiovascular risk factors, and platelet counts <1500 ×
109/L. These patients are managed with phlebotomy to an Hct of <45%
and low-dose aspirin. Iron deficiency via phlebotomy is a goal of
158

treatment.
High-risk patients are ≥60 years old or have a history of a thrombotic
event, or cardiovascular risk factors, or platelet counts >1500 × 10 9/L.
These patients typically require cytoreductive agents in addition to
phlebotomy, and aspirin is usually held off until platelet counts are
<1500 × 109/L.
Treatmentfor intermediate-risk patients must be individualized, as
data are insufficient to clearly support either a conservative (low-risk) or
an aggressive (high-risk) treatment plan. Typically, these patients are
treated with phlebotomy, aspirin, and management of cardiovascular risk
factors to limit thrombotic risk. Patients with elevated platelets (>400 ×
109 to 600 × 109/L) or elevated leukocytes (>15 × 109/L) may need to
be treated more like high-risk patients.
Medications

Hydroxyurea, interferon-alpha, and anagrelide are the most commonly used
cytoreductive agents.
Hydroxyurea acts to decrease all three blood lines. It has been
particularly useful in patients with extensive pruritus. Long-term use of
hydroxyurea has been suggested to increase the risk of leukemogenesis
(mean time to transformation ~15 years). This has been difficult to
assess in MPD patients, who already have an underlying propensity
toward leukemic evolution. However, in other diseases, such as sickle
cell anemia, leukemogenic risk has not been seen. Long follow-up of
prospective trials will be required to definitively answer this question,
and some authors currently prefer its use in the elderly more than in
those younger than 60 years. Hydroxyurea is generally well tolerated but
may cause erythema, hyperpigmentation, and distal leg ulcers.
Gastrointestinal symptoms of nausea, vomiting, constipation, and
diarrhea are very common with doses >60 mg/kg.

159

Interferon-alpha decreases both the red cell number and the
frequency of thrombohemorrhagic events. As in CML, it affects the stem
cell compartment, and reversal of JAK2 mutational status can be seen. It
must be administered subcutaneously and can cause fever, arthralgias,
myalgias, alopecia, anorexia, peripheral neuropathies, and depression.
ACE inhibitors should be avoided with interferon-alpha, as this may lead
to granulocytopenia and thrombocytopenia.
Anagrelide primarily effects platelet production and is more commonly
used in PV for thrombocytosis. Side effects include palpitations,
tachycardia, nausea, diarrhea, and fluid retention.
Agentssuchas radioactive phosphorus and alkylating agents also
are cytoreductive but are associated with increased transformation to
AML and are rarely used today. Radioactive 32P may have a role in
noncompliant patients with life expectancy <10years.
Additional agents can be useful in symptom management.
Hyperuricemiamay be treated with allopurinol. Erythromelalgia may
be treated with aspirin or other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.
Hemorrhage should be managed with platelet transfusion, since
platelets have abnormal function in PV. Pruritus is often poorly
responsive to antihistamines but may respond to cimetidine or
cyproheptadine. If these agents fail, cytoreductive agents may be
needed.
SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS

160

Surgery. Elective surgery should be avoided in patients with poorly
controlled polycythemia, as 75% will have hemorrhagic or thrombotic
complications, and mortality is high. Platelet counts and Hct should be
controlled for at least 2 months before surgery, if possible.
Thromboembolic prophylaxis should be used as well. Splenectomy is
rarely recommended in PV patients because of the high risk of surgical
complications.
Polycythemia vera and pregnancy. There is an increased incidence
of premature births, preeclampsia, and hemorrhage in PV patients.
Management should include phlebotomy and low-dose aspirin. Aspirin
should be discontinued ~5 days prior to delivery to limit hemorrhagic
risk. If cytotoxic treatment is needed, interferon-alpha is the agent of
choice, as it has not been shown to be teratogenic or leukemogenic.
OUTCOME/PROGNOSIS
Patients with PV who are treated have a mortality rate similar to that of agematched controls. Death is secondary to thrombosis in 30% to 40% of patients.
Myelofibrosis is the cause of death ~5% of patients, and hemorrhage is the cause in
2% to 10% of patients.

ESSENTIAL THROMBOCYTHEMIA OR ESSENTIAL
THROMBOCYTOSIS

GENERAL PRINCIPLES

Definition

Essential thrombocythemia or essential thrombocytosis (ET) is a stem cell
disorder whose distinguishing characteristic is a markedly elevated platelet count
caused by excessive megakaryocyte proliferation. The activating JAK2 V617F
mutation is seen in nearly half of patients with ET, and patients also may have other
clinical features of PV. Studies of X chromosome inactivation suggest that ET is a
heterogeneous disease and both monoclonal and polyclonal evolution has been
161

noted.
Epidemiology

ET occurs at an incidence of between 1.5 and 2.5 cases per 100,000. Most
patients are >50 years old, and there is a female predominance.
Pathophysiology

Neither TPO nor its receptor (c-Mpl) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of
ET. Mutations involving the c-Mpl gene are only rarely identified in ET,4 and
endogenous megakaryocyte colony growth does not appear to be dependent on an
autocrine stimulation involving TPO. This is in contrast to autosomal dominant
familial ET where activating mutations in the genes for TPO or c-Mpl, or mutations
in the genes for other proteins, are responsible for TPO-mediated thrombocytosis.
Serum TPO levels in ET have been reported to be inappropriately normal or
elevated. This unexpected finding may be a result of increased bone marrow stromal
production of TPO or decreased ligand clearance associated with reduced platelet
c-Mpl expression in patients with ET.
DIAGNOSIS

Clinical Presentation

Symptoms generally are related to hemorrhage and vaso-occlusion, although
most patients are asymptomatic at diagnosis. Bleeding is commonly from mucous
membranes, skin, and GI tract and is rarely life threatening. Vaso-occlusion may
cause erythromelalgia (burning pain, increased skin warmth, and erythema of the feet
and hands), transient ischemic attacks, visual disturbances, headache, seizures, and
dizziness. Large vessel involvement has also been reported with myocardial
infarction and cerebrovascular accidents. A small percentage of patients may
experience pruritus. Physical exam findings are generally limited to splenomegaly
and easy bruising.
Diagnostic Testing

Patients have an elevated platelet count, with large platelets visible on
peripheral smear. Granulocytes may be increased, with mild basophilia and rare
early forms. Serum B12 and leukocyte alkaline phosphatase scores are generally
162

normal. Iron deficiency must be ruled out. Bone marrow findings are commonly
nondiagnostic and include hypercellularity with granulocyte hyperplasia and
increased megakaryocytes. The megakaryocytes are large, are often clustered, and
may exhibit mild atypia. JAK2 V619F is seen in nearly half of ET patients.
At Washington University, we have begun incorporating JAK2 status into the
diagnostic criteria (Table 9-2). Other causes of reactive (secondary)
thrombocytosis should be carefully investigated and include splenectomy, trauma,
cancer, acute and chronic inflammation, infection, and iron deficiency. C-reactive
protein and sedimentation rate can be useful in this evaluation. If iron stores are
absent, iron replacement is initiated, which may uncover PV in some patients.
Philadelphia chromosome also should be evaluated to rule out CML. Ultimately,
bone marrow biopsy may be required to differentiate ET from myelodysplastic
syndromes.
TREATMENT
The goals of treatment focus on maintaining platelet counts of <600 × 109/L
(<400 × 109 /L if possible) and limiting thrombo-hemorrhagic risk. Thrombotic risk
has been linked to age (>60 years old), prior thrombosis, and platelet count >400 ×
109 to 600 × 109/L. Other risk factors that are still emerging and being validated
include elevated leukocytes (>8.7 × 109 /L), positive JAK2 V617F mutation, and
cardiovascular risk factors such as diabetes, obesity, smoking, hypertension,
hyperlipidemia, and hypercholesterolemia (Table 9-3).
Low-risk patients are <60 years old, with no prior thrombotic event
and a platelet count <400 × 109 to 600 × 109 /L. These patients are
managed with low-dose aspirin and observation.
High-risk patients are >60 years old or have a history of thrombosis.
These patients require cytoreductive agents such as hydroxyurea,
interferon-alpha, and anagrelide, with aggressive treatment of reversible
risk factors.
Intermediate-risk patients require individualized therapy.
Aspirin is commonly used to prevent thrombosis but should be withheld
once platelet counts are >1500 × 109/L due to bleeding risk. Extreme
thrombocytosis may promote the abnormal adsorption of large von
Willebrand factor (vWF) multimers and result in a hemostatic defect.
Accordingly, such patients should be screened for the presence of
acquired von Willebrand disease (vWD). Low-dose aspirin therapy (e.g.,
163

<100 mg/d) is acceptable if the ristocetin cofactor level is at least 30%;
if <30%, all aspirin should be avoided. As discussed in the PV section
above, hydroxyurea has been suggested to increase the risk of
leukemic transformation in MPD patients (mean time to transformation
~15 years). In young patients, it is not unreasonable to start with
anagrelide, which has not been linked to leukemogenesis. However,
the combination of anagrelide and aspirin has been shown to increase
the risk of bleeding compared to hydroxyurea and aspirin. In patients
who require aspirin, especially those >60 years, hydroxyurea is still
typically the first-line agent. In younger patients, alternatives include
anagrelide monotherapy and interferon-alpha.
Management of thrombosis typically requires either lifelong aspirin,
for arterial thrombosis, or coumadin, for venous thrombosis. In addition,
other risk factors should be aggressively managed, including platelet
count, leukocyte count, and cardiovascular risk factors.
Rarely, symptomatic, extreme thrombocytosis may be managed with
thrombopheresis, although the results are short lived and must be
combined with other modalities of therapy.
Symptoms of gout may be managed with allopurinol. Vaso-occlusive
symptoms may respond to aspirin alone. Like PV, pruritus may
respond to cimetidine or cyproheptadine.
SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS

Surgery. Splenectomy poses a high risk for patients with ET and an
increased platelet count and is contraindicated.
Essential thrombocythemia and pregnancy. Pregnant patients are
at higher risk of early miscarriage complications and are often treated
with aspirin. As the pregnancy progresses, the platelet count usually
decreases toward the normal range but may rebound quickly after
delivery. Aspirin should be discontinued ~5 days prior to delivery to limit
hemorrhagic risk.
OUTCOME/PROGNOSIS
Patients generally have an excellent prognosis and appear to have median
164

survivals similar to those of age-matched controls. Morbidity and mortality are
related to thrombotic and hemorrhagic events. Transformation to AML is relatively
rare, but risk is increased in patients treated with multiple cytotoxic drugs.

CHRONIC IDIOPATHIC MYELOFIBROSIS (AGNOGENIC
MYELOID METAPLASIA)

GENERAL PRINCIPLES

Definition

Chronic idiopathic myelofibrosis (CIMF) is a clonal disorder thought to arise
from a primitive lymphohematopoietic precursor. Patients have clonal circulating
red cells, granulocytes, and platelets, and their marrow is fibrotic due to a reactive,
polyclonal proliferation of fibroblasts and other mesenchymal cells induced by the
neo-plastic cells. The neoplastic cells also emigrate from the marrow and establish
sites of extramedullary hematopoiesis (myeloid metaplasia) in various sites
throughout the body. One-third of cases of CIMF harbor cytogenetic abnormalities at
diagnosis and often transform to AML. Common genetic abnormalities found in
CIMF are mutations in JAK2 (35% to 55%), the retinoblastoma susceptibility gene,
and the p53 gene, as well as abnormalities of the RAS family of proto-oncogenes.
Neoangiogenesis is particularly active in CIMF compared with the other
myeloproliferative syndromes.
Epidemiology

CIMF is the least common of the MPDs, with an annual incidence of 0.2 to 1.5
cases per 100,000. The typical case is a male older than age 50 years. The median
age at presentation is 67 years, and 70% of cases are diagnosed after age 60 years.
No common etiologic factor has been identified, although there are sporadic reports
of an association with radiation and benzene exposure.
DIAGNOSIS

Clinical Presentation

165

Two-thirds of patients are symptomatic at diagnosis from the effects of
hypercatabolism, cytopenias, or extramedullary hematopoiesis (Table 9-4). Bone
pain may also be a prominent feature. Splenomegaly is very common, with 85% to
100% of patients having it at diagnosis, and it is frequently progressive, with up to
35% of patients developing massive splenomegaly (extending into the pelvis). Twothirds of patients will have hepatomegaly, and 10% will have peripheral
lymphadenopathy. A minority of patients will develop portal hypertension, with the
associated signs and symptoms.
Diagnostic Criteria

CIMF is diagnosed when the following are present:
Presence of megakaryocyte proliferation and atypia, usually
accompanied by reticulin and/or collagen
WHO criteria for PV, CML, MDS, or other myeloid neoplasm not met
Demonstration of a clonal marker (e.g., JAK2 or MPL)
Leukoerythroblastosis
Palpable splenomegaly
Anemia
Increased serum lactate dehydrogenase level
Other causes of bone marrow fibrosis should be excluded, including cancers
metastatic to the marrow, CML, myelodysplasia with fibrosis, other MPDs,
infection, autoimmune disorders, secondary hyperparathyroidism associated with
vitamin D deficiency, and lymphoma. In addition, the marrow may not be fibrotic
early in the course of the disease, further complicating the diagnosis. Careful
morphologic exam of the bone marrow, as well as cytogenetic studies, may help to
differentiate among disorders. The diagnosis of osteosclerosis is made when
sclerotic lesions by x-ray are present along with the criteria for CIMF. These lesions
occur in up to 50% of patients and may cause severe pain.

166

Diagnostic Testing

The complete blood count is usually abnormal in CIMF. Fifty percent
to 70% of patients will be anemic at presentation, some severely, with
25% having an Hgb <8 g/dL. Other abnormalities are variably present:
leukocytosis (50%), leucopenia (7%), thrombocytosis (28%), and
thrombocytopenia (37%). The peripheral smear shows a
leukoerythroblastic picture with teardrop poikilocytes, nucleated red
cells, and anisocytosis. Abnormalities in immunologic studies are
found in 50% of patients and include autoantibodies, polyclonal
hyperglobulinemia, a positive Coombs test, and monoclonal antibodies.
During bone marrow biopsy, marrow may not be attainable by
aspiration secondary to fibrosis, resulting in a “dry tap.” Findings on
marrow exam include increased cellularity, granulocyte hyperplasia, and
megakaryocyte dysplasia. Reticulin staining is increased, and variable
degrees of fibrosis are present. The diagnosis is usually made by the
constellation of increased marrow reticulin or collagen fibrosis, typical
leukoerythroblastic peripheral blood findings, and splenomegaly in the
absence of other known disorders such as ET, PV, CML, and AML-M7.
TREATMENT
Conventional therapy, including supportive care, does not alter the natural
history of CIMF. Low-risk patients with only mild splenomegaly should initially be
observed. Those with progressive organomegaly and/or leukocytosis or
thrombocytosis should be initially managed with hydroxyurea. Those with painful or
massive splenomegaly and those with portal hypertension should be considered for
either splenic irradiation or splenectomy. Those who develop anemia in the setting
of cytopenias should be treated with androgens, transfusion, and exogenous EPO.
Those who develop anemia and increased WBC and/or platelet counts should be
managed with corticosteroids and transfusions.
Splenectomy may alleviate mass-related symptoms, portal
hypertension, refractory anemia, and thrombocytopenia. Prolonged
benefit has been seen; however, serious perioperative complications,
including bleeding, thrombosis, and infection, occur in nearly 30% of
persons. Therefore, it should be reserved for patients who have not
responded to more conservative management for these symptoms. The
167

median survival for patients undergoing splenectomy is 2 years. There is
an increased risk for leukemic transformation in those individuals who
undergo splenectomy.
Splenic irradiation usually controls pain and other symptoms related
to splenomegaly (94% of the time for a median of 6 months), but the
associated toxicity is not trivial. Severe cytopenias may develop in up to
43% of irradiated patients, of which 13% may be fatal due to infections
and hemorrhage. Toxicity is not related to radiation dose, so blood
counts must be monitored closely with treatment. In addition, radiation
therapy does not improve the anemia and, therefore, is generally used
for patients who are not surgical candidates.
Thalidomide, with or without a tapering course of steroids, has shown
some promise in ameliorating both splenomegaly and cytopenias.
Unfortunately it is poorly tolerated, with up to two-thirds of persons
stopping the medication within 6 months. Lenalidomide may have
similar benefits, with better tolerability. These and other targeted
therapies have been associated with a hyperproliferative syndrome
requiring rescue hydroxyurea for leukocytosis and/or thrombocytosis.
Etanercept (Enbrel, 25 mg SQ twice weekly) has been associated with
improvement of constitutional symptoms (e.g., weight loss, night
sweats, fatigue, fever).
JAK2 inhibitors are being investigated in patients with myelofibrosis.
Reductions in splenic size and relief of symptoms (e.g., pruritus, fatigue)
have been reported.
Allogeneic stem cell transplantation is the only therapy that offers
the chance to eliminate marrow fibrosis and potentially cure patients.
With standard myeloablative conditioning regimens, there is significant
morbidity and mortality. Reduced-intensity conditioning regimens may
abrogate some of these complications. Transplantation should be
considered in young patients with a poor prognosis and a
histocompatible donor.
OUTCOME/PROGNOSIS

The course of CIMF is highly variable, and most of the morbidity and
mortality is due to progressive marrow failure, thrombosis,
hypersplenism, advanced age, and evolution into AML. The rate of
168

progression to acute leukemia is ~20% over 10 years. Approximately
7% of patients will develop portal hyper-tension related to increased
portal flow from massive splenomegaly as well as intrahepatic
obstruction related to thrombosis in small portal veins. Associated
ascites and variceal bleeding may occur. Progressive splenomegaly may
lead to splenic infarction, which presents acutely with fever, nausea,
and left upper quadrant pain. Patients may develop neutrophilic
dermatoses, which appear as tender plaques. Extramedullary
hematopoiesis may develop in many sites, including the spleen, liver,
lymph nodes, serosal surfaces, paraspinal or epidural spaces, and
urogenital system.
CIMF carries the worst prognosis of all the MPDs, with a median survival
of ~3.5 to 5.5 years. However, survival is variable and ranges from <3 to
>10 years. The International Working Group for Myelofibrosis Research
and Treatment has devised a prognostic scoring system (IPSS-PMF) from
an evaluation of presenting signs and symptoms in 1054 consecutively
studied patients diagnosed with CIMF at seven different centers. The
following five adverse prognostic features were noted on
multivariate analysis:6
Presence of constitutional symptoms (i.e., weight loss >10%, night
sweats, or fever)
Age >65 years
Hemoglobin <10g/dL
Leukocyte count >25,000/µL
Circulating blast cells ≥1%
Subjects with 0 (low risk), 1 (intermediate risk-1), 2 (intermediate risk2), or ≥3 (high risk) of these variables at presentation had
nonoverlapping median survivals of 135, 95, 48, and 27 months,
respectively.
The degree of fibrosis does not appear to be related to prognosis. In
addition, cytogenetic findings predict either good (sole abnormalities of
del(20q), del(13q), trisomy 9) or poor (complex abnormalities, trisomy
8) prognosis. The prognostic value of other cytogenetic findings is
unclear because of the small number of patients evaluated. Two studies
have shown that a low burden of the JAK 2V617F allele in PMF might
indicate the presence of an overriding V617F-negative clone that confers
a more aggressive disease phenotype with shortened overall survival,
169

although the biologic mechanisms underlying this correlation remain to
be established.

HYPEREOSINOPHILIC SYNDROMES

GENERAL PRINCIPLES

Definition

Two syndromes compose this category: chronic eosinophilic leukemia (CEL)
and idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES). They should be suspected when
the peripheral eosinophil count is persistently >1500/µL. The diagnosis of these
disorders requires ruling out other causes of eosinophilia, such as underlying
infection, allergy, autoimmune disease, pulmonary disease, clonal lymphoid
disorder, and other MPDs. Also, the peripheral eosinophilia should be accompanied
by an elevated eosinophil count in bone marrow and characteristic end-organ
damage.
Epidemiology

HES is rare and the prevalence is unknown. Most patients are diagnosed
between the ages of 20 and 50 years, although HES can develop in children.
PDGFRalpha (PDGFRA)-associated HES occurs almost exclusively in males,
whereas lymphocytic variant HES and HES of unknown etiology appear to be
equally distributed between the sexes.
Pathophysiology

Eosinophils are derived from myeloid progenitors in the bone marrow, through
the action of three hematopoietic cytokines: granulocyte-macrophage colonystimulating factor (GM-CSF), interleukin (IL)-3, and IL-5. Of these three, only IL-5
is specific for eosinophil differentiation.
Several mechanisms have been proposed to account for the dysregulated
overproduction of eosinophils in patients with HES: 7
Clonal eosinophilic proliferation as a result of a primary molecular defect
involving hematopoietic stem cells and/or defects in signal transduction
170

from the receptors that mediate eosinophilopoiesis
Overproduction of eosinophilopoietic cytokines, such as IL-5
Functional abnormalities of the eosinophilopoietic cytokines, related to
enhanced or prolonged biologic activity
Defects in the normal suppressive regulation of eosinophilopoiesis or of
eosinophil survival and activation
DIAGNOSIS

Clinical Presentation

Ninety percent of patients will have symptoms at diagnosis. Characteristically,
patients will complain of various nonspecific constitutional symptoms such as
fever, fatigue, cough, pruritus, diarrhea, angioedema, and muscle pains. Infiltrating
eosinophils will produce end-organ damage in the majority of patients within 3
years of diagnosis. Cardiac disease is the major cause of death, but virtually every
organ system may be involved, leading to protean clinical manifestations (Table 95).

171

Diagnostic Criteria

Diagnosis relies on the exclusion of all possible causes of reactive eosinophilia.
Also, patients must be evaluated and ruled out for T-cell lymphomas, Hodgkin
lymphoma, mastocytosis, ALL, AML, CML, PV, ET, CIMF, and the myelodysplastic
syndromes. If all of these exclusions are met, a diagnosis of HES can be made. If
there is a clonal chromosomal abnormality or if there are >2% blasts in the
peripheral blood or >5% but <19% blasts on bone marrow aspirate, then the
diagnosis is CEL. If there are >20% blasts on bone marrow aspirate, then the
diagnosis is AML.
Diagnostic Testing

The diagnosis is usually suspected based on peripheral eosinophilia and some
constellation of the symptoms reviewed in Table 9-4. CEL is due to an autonomous
proliferation of clonal cells. HES is diagnosed when the diagnostic criteria for CEL
are satisfied, but without evidence of clonality or myeloid cell proliferation. A
molecular defect has been identified in about half of CEL/HES cases. It is a specific
interstitial deletion on chromosome 4 that results in the expression of a FIP1L1172

PDGFRA fusion tyrosine kinase. This fusion kinase is sensitive to inhibition by
imatinib.
Treatment is aimed at those with end-organ damage. Corticosteroids
reduce peripheral eosinophil numbers and the toxicity of the eosinophilic
granules. Steroid-resistant patients are treated with various single-agent
or combination therapies, including hydroxyurea, interferon, vincristine,
and etoposide.
Several recent studies have shown the efficacy of imatinib in the
treatment of both CEL and HES. Notably, responses are seen both in
patients with recognized mutations of the FIP1L1-PDGFRA kinase, the
assumed target of imatinib in this disease, and in those without it. These
dramatic responses argue that imatinib should be the first-line therapy
for symptomatic CEL and HES. For HES patients (with or without the
FIP1L1/PDGFRA fusion) who fail pharmacologic management,
allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant offers a chance of longterm remission.
OUTCOMES/PROGNOSIS
The clinical course of both HES and CEL is markedly variable. Features that
portend a better prognosis include the following:
Prolonged eosinopenia in response to prednisone challenge
The absenceoffindings associated with MPDs, including elevated serum
vita-min B12, abnormal leukocyte alkaline phosphatase scores,
splenomegaly, cytogenetic abnormalities, myelofibrosis, and myeloid
dysplasia
The presence of angioedema, although this observation may have been
due to the inclusion of patients with the entity of episodic angioedema
with eosinophilia (Gleich's syndrome)
Blast transformation may come early or very late in the clinical course.
Features that predict a poor prognosis are marked splenomegaly, cytogenetic
abnormalities, dysplastic myeloid features, and increased peripheral or marrow
blast counts. Long-term survival is possible. In one case series up to 42% of persons
were still alive 15 years after diagnosis.

GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Transfusion of donated blood products is used to treat many disorders, including
anemia and impaired hemostasis. This treatment may be life saving, but all blood
products carry the risk of transfusion complications, some of which may be life
threatening. The functions of blood centers and hospital blood banks include
consultation in appropriate blood product use and the delivery of blood products that
have undergone adequate precautions for safety.
PRETRANSFUSION SCREENING AND TESTING

Donor Screening

Donors undergo extensive screening and testing to ensure the safety of both the
donors and the eventual recipients of their donated products. At the time of donation,
donors must meet requirements for age, weight, vital signs, and hematologic indices,
and they are asked a battery of questions to assess their risk of transfusiontransmitted diseases and other conditions that may affect donation and transfusion
safety. Their blood is screened for infectious diseases (Table 10-1). Transfusiontransmitted infections are extremely rare due to effective screening, but they cannot
be completely eliminated because screening cannot identify new infections during
the initial, undetectable “window period.”
Compatibility Testing

Blood collection centers and blood banks provide routine laboratory testing of
175

both donors and recipients to prevent hemolytic transfusion reactions due to ABO
antibodies and other clinically relevant antibodies to RBC antigens, as well as to
prevent the formation of alloantibodies against the Rh D antigen in Rh-negative
recipients. This testing is performed by serology. RBCs from a patient or donor are
incubated with plasma from a patient or donor or a reagent known to contain specific
antibodies. If IgM antibodies (such as ABO antibodies) are present against an
antigen on the RBCs, antibody binding will cause the formation of a visible cell
clump due to agglutination after the sample is centrifuged. This technique is called
immediate spin, and is primarily used to quickly identify ABO type, ABO
antibodies, and Rh D type. IgG antibodies do not routinely cause visible
agglutination, and therefore a reagent anti-human globulin (Coomb’s reagent) is
added, and the sample is incubated for 30 to 60 minutes at 37°C to strengthen the
reaction due to antibody crosslinking. This technique is called Coomb’s test, and is
primarily used to identify common clinically relevant antibodies responsible for
non-ABO hemolytic transfusion reactions, such as Rh (D, C, and E), Kell, Duffy, and
Kidd. The common compatibility tests performed in the blood bank are summarized
in Table 10-2.

Emergency Release

In certain critical situations, the immediate need for transfusion supersedes the
need for standard and potentially time-consuming compatibility testing. In these
situations, it is appropriate for clinicians to request an emergency release of blood
products before compatibility testing is completed. In these cases, type O RBCs
(which lack ABO antigens) and type AB plasma (which lacks ABO antibodies)
176

are transfused until testing is complete, in order to avoid an acute hemolytic
reaction due to ABO antibodies.
BLOOD PRODUCTS
Most blood products are produced from whole blood, which is separated into
components by centrifugation and manual separation. Packed RBCs, platelets, and
plasma may also be collected separately by apheresis. Coagulation factor
concentrates are produced by fractionation of multiple units of donated plasma or by
synthesis of recombinant proteins. The most common blood products available are
described in Table 10-3.
PRODUCT MODIFICATIONS
Depending on the clinical situation, modifications and specifications may be
requested for blood products. The most common are described in Table 10-4.

PLATELET REFRACTORINESS
In some patients, response to platelet transfusions may be lower than expected.
This condition is known as platelet refractoriness and may have multiple causes
(Table 10-5). Platelet refractoriness is typically suspected if a patient’s platelet
count rises by <30,000/μL 10 to 60 minutes following transfusion.
Because platelets do express some ABO and human leukocyte antigen (HLA)
activity, platelet-refractory patients may respond better to ABO-matched and/or
HLA-matched platelet transfusions. ABO matching is performed by serologic
compatibility testing as with RBCs. It is advisable to begin with ABO matching, as
the serologic techniques are easy and inexpensive to perform. If ABO matching is
not successful, HLA matching is indicated; this is particularly common in patients
who have received bone marrow transplants and/or multiple transfusions. HLA
matching may be done by crossmatching selected units, or by obtaining an HLA
antibody screen of the recipient, and selecting donors whose HLA type is
compatible with the recipient’s screen.
TRANSFUSION COMPLICATIONS
Every blood product carries with it the risk of transfusion complications, some
of which may be severe and life-threatening. It is important to recognize the signs
and symptoms of a transfusion complication and treat it appropriately.
Recommendations for diagnosis and treatment are shown in Table 10-6. In all cases,
if a suspected transfusion reaction occurs during transfusion, it should be
stopped immediately, and appropriate measures taken.

GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a term for a group of genetic disorders
characterized by the presence of at least one sickle gene and the predominance of
hemoglobin (Hgb) S. Examples of SCD include sickle cell anemia (homozygous Hgb
SS), sickle beta-thalassemia syndromes (Hgb S-beta+ or S-beta0), and Hgb SC
disease.1 There is tremendous variability in clinical severity among disease groups
and among individual patients with the same Hgb abnormalities. In the United States,
these disorders are most commonly observed in African Americans and Hispanics
from the Caribbean, Central America, and parts of South America and less
commonly in Mediterranean, Indian, and Middle Eastern populations. In African
Americans, the incidence of Hgb SS is 1:350 and that of Hgb SC is 1:835. The two
hallmark pathophysiologic features of sickle cell disorders are chronic hemolytic
anemia and vaso-occlusion, resulting in ischemic tissue injury.
Pathophysiology

Normal Hgb is a tetramer consisting of two alpha and two beta chains. Hgb S
results from the substitution of valine for glutamic acid at the sixth amino acid
of the beta-globin gene. The change in the molecular structure of Hgb S results
in the polymerization of the Hgb tetramers leading to the sickled shape of the
RBC and increased whole-blood viscosity.
Factors that contribute to Hgb S polymerization include decreased pH, RBC
dehydration, and, most importantly, decreased O2 tension. The poor
deformability of the RBC containing Hgb S results in occlusion of the
microvasculature and ischemic tissue injury.
It is now appreciated that pro-inflammatory interactions among the sickled cell,
186

the vascular endothelium, and circulating leukocytes and reticulocytes
contribute to vaso-occlusion. Sickled RBCs adhere to and activate vascular
endothelium, causing further up-regulation of endothelial adhesion molecules
and recruitment and activation of WBCs. Adherent WBCs and sickled RBCs
form aggregates in the microvasculature, impede blood flow, and lead to
continued hypoxia. Abnormal vasomotor tone favoring vasoconstriction also
contributes to vaso-occlusion. Organs prone to venous stasis such as spleen and
bone marrow are susceptible to frequent vaso-occlusion and infarction.
DIAGNOSIS

Clinical Presentation

The hallmarks of SCD are anemia due to decreased RBC lifespan and chronic
hemolysis, and vaso-occlusion leading to acute and chronic complications
secondary to end-organ dysfunction.2 The major causes of morbidity are acute vasoocclusive pain crises, anemia, and infections. The clinical manifestations of SCD
vary tremendously both within and among the major genotypes. Even within
genotypes regarded as being the most severe for patients with SCD, some patients
are entirely asymptomatic, whereas others are disabled by recurrent pain and
chronic complications. SCD is associated with a shortened life expectancy due to
multisystem failure from acute and chronic vaso-occlusion. One autopsy series3
reported causes of death in sickle cell patients, in decreasing order of frequency,
as infection, stroke, therapy complications, splenic sequestration, pulmonary
emboli/thrombi, renal failure, pulmonary hypertension, hepatic failure, red cell
aplasia, and left ventricular dysfunction. Of note, death was sudden in 40% of the
cases. In 1973, the mean survival was only 14.3 years. Currently, the life expectancy
is 42 years for men and 48 years for women with sickle cell anemia. Risk factors
for mortality in SCD are frequent pain crises, acute chest syndrome (ACS), and
renal and pulmonary disease.
Sickle cell trait

Sickle cell trait (Hgb AS) has a prevalence of ~8% to 10% in African
Americans. Sickle cell trait is a benign carrier condition with no hematologic
manifestations. Red cell morphology, red cell indices, and the reticulocyte count are
normal. Patients with sickle cell trait have a normal life expectancy. Clinical
complications of sickle cell trait have been reported, most typically splenic
187

infarction occurring at high altitudes; hematuria; increased frequency of urinary tract
infection, especially in pregnancy; and a mild defect in ability to concentrate urine.
Sickle cell trait is also associated with a 30-fold increased incidence of sudden
death during basic training of African American military recruits, apparently related
to exercise-induced vaso-occlusion and rhabdomyolysis. Risk factors include
exertion under extreme conditions, and the risk of sudden death can be reduced with
measures to prevent exertional heat illness. Sickle cell trait is not a contraindication
to competitive sports and screening prior to participation is not required. In
individuals who appear to have sickle cell trait but are symptomatic, the lab
diagnosis must be verified. Hemoglobins other than S that polymerize may account
for reports of “sickle cell trait” associated with clinical problems, and these patients
should be further evaluated.
Hemoglobin SC disease

Hgb SC disease is approximately one-fourth as frequent among African
Americans as Hgb SS. Although deoxygenated Hgb C forms crystals, Hgb C does not
participate in polymerization with deoxy–Hgb S. This results in a disease that is less
severe than homozygous Hgb SS disease, and the degree of anemia and leukocytosis
is frequently mild. Splenomegaly may be the only physical finding, and clinical
complications may be less frequent than in sickle cell anemia. The lifespan of Hgb
SC and Hgb SS red cells is 27 and 17 days, respectively. The predominant red cell
abnormality on the peripheral smear is an abundance of target cells and crystalcontaining cells. The frequency of acute painful episodes is approximately one-half
that of sickle cell anemia, and the life expectancy is two decades longer. However,
there is a higher incidence of peripheral retinopathy in Hgb SC disease than Hgb SS
disease. These patients may present with splenic sequestration and infarct in
adulthood.
Diagnostic Testing

Neonatal screening resulting in timely definitive diagnosis and appropriate
comprehensive care has been shown to reduce the morbidity and mortality of
SCD in early childhood. Forty-four states and the District of Columbia provide
universal screening for newborns, and screening upon request is provided in
the other six states. When a screening test indicates SCD, a definitive diagnosis
is established through further blood testing. SCD is identified through lab
testing alone. There are no findings on physical exam that suggest the presence
or absence of Hgb S.
The peripheral smear is normal in sickle cell trait (Hgb AS), but sickle cells
188

are seen in each of the major SCD syndromes. Solubility testing is abnormal in
all syndromes having at least one sickle cell gene and thus detects all carriers
of the Hgb S gene, as well as those with the SS phenotype.
Hgb electrophoresis is able to provide the clinician with the exact phenotype
of SCD. Typical electrophoretic profiles are listed in Table 11-1.
TREATMENT4

Chronic Management

Many patients can live for long periods without experiencing acute or severe
exacerbations of SCD. Increased awareness of the disease and its long-term
complications is contributing to the prolonged survival seen in sickle cell
patients today.
All patients with SCD should have routine office appointments to establish
baseline physical findings, lab data, and a relationship between the patient and
the treating physician. Patients with Hgb SS should have regular medical
evaluations every 3 to 6 months, depending on the symptoms or manifestations
of the disease.
Preventive care should be initiated and maintained. A vaccination history
should also be maintained. Adults should have seasonal influenza vaccines. If
the patient has never received the pneumococcal vaccination, it should be
offered and given at intervals based on the recommendations of the American
Association of Family Physicians. Daily folic acid (1 mg PO daily) is given for
the prevention of folate deficiency in the chronic hemolytic state. Retinal
evaluation by an ophthalmologist is begun at school age and should be
continued to monitor for evidence of retinopathy. Patients with relative
hypertension are at increased risk for stroke and should be monitored and
treated. Patients should be counseled during routine clinic visits about red flags
for which they should seek further medical attention (Table 11-2).
Hydroxyurea is a cytotoxic drug that has been shown to decrease the frequency
of acute pain crisis, ACS, hospital admissions, and blood transfusions and to
decrease mortality in adults with Hgb SS. It is generally indicated in patients
with more severe manifestations of SCD. The mechanism by which
hydroxyurea influences sickle cells and vaso-occlusion is likely multifactorial,
including increases in Hgb F synthesis, improved red cell deformability,
modulation of sickle cell adherence properties, increased nitric oxide
189

production, and effects on WBCs. Hydroxyurea causes a decrease in the
reticulocyte, platelet, and WBC counts. The dose is titrated to achieve clinical
effect with minimal toxicity. However, not all patients respond to hydroxyurea.
Of note, hydroxyurea has been shown to be teratogenic in mice, and should be
avoided in pregnancy. Hydroxyurea has the potential to be carcinogenic, but the
exact risk is unknown.

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS

190

Surgery and Anesthesia

Surgery and anesthesia are stress states that can provoke a painful sickle crisis.
Currently, it is recommended that patients with SCD undergo simple transfusion to
an Hgb of 10 mg/dL before elective surgery. Studies comparing aggressive
transfusion (Hgb S levels <30%) versus conservative transfusion (Hgb S <60%,
Hgb = 10 mg/dL) showed no benefit of the more aggressive regimen.5 Intraoperative
overexpansion of blood volume should be avoided, particularly in patients with
decreased cardiac function. Hypothermia must also be avoided in the OR to prevent
sickling. After surgery, IV fluid management must ensure adequate hydration, with
the avoidance of volume overload and pulmonary complications. Incentive
spirometry should also be employed.
Dental Procedures

Procedures requiring local anesthesia can be performed in the dentist’s office.
However, any dental procedure requiring general anesthesia warrants hospital
admission.
Transfusion Therapy6

Transfusion of RBCs has been used for almost every complication of SCD,
although clinical trials have not been performed supporting efficacy for each
complication. Indications for transfusion include the need to improve O2carrying capacity (as in aplastic crisis or ACS), increase blood volume (as in
splenic sequestration), or improve blood rheology (to prevent stroke
recurrence, prior to surgery). Simple transfusion can be sufficient to improve
O2-carrying capacity and blood volume and is generally indicated in aplastic
crisis, acute splenic and hepatic sequestration, milder cases of ACS, and prior
to surgery. Partial exchange transfusion has the advantage of decreasing the
percentage of Hgb S without increasing the blood volume or causing
hyperviscosity. It is generally recommended for acute indications such as ACS,
acute ischemic stroke, retinal artery occlusion, and multiple organ failure and
may be recommended for chronic transfusion programs, in which avoiding
hyperviscosity and iron overload is important.
Indications for chronic transfusion, which may be either simple or exchange,
are primary stroke prevention for at-risk children and secondary stroke
prevention in children; of note, many clinicians apply the same principles to
adults with stroke. Patients with pulmonary hypertension and recurrent ACS
191

may also benefit from chronic transfusion. The goal of transfusion is to raise the
Hgb to a level of ~10 g/dL. Levels >10 g/dL can lead to hyperviscosity and
increased vaso-occlusion. Transfusion is not indicated for compensated
anemia, uncomplicated acute painful crises, uncomplicated pregnancy,
avascular necrosis, infection, or minor surgery without anesthesia. Transfusion
is controversial for priapism and leg ulcers.
Transfusion complications in sickle cell patients are common and include the
following:
Alloimmunization in transfused sickle cell patients is due in part to minor
blood-group incompatibilities (Rh, Kell, Duffy, and Kidd antigens)
resulting from antigenic discrepancy in the donor (mostly Caucasian) and
recipient (mostly African American) pool. Five to fifty percent of SCD
patients who have received multiple transfusions develop
alloimmunization, which is a risk for delayed hemolytic reactions and can
make obtaining compatible blood difficult.
Hyperviscosity syndrome is characterized by a posttransfusion elevation
in blood pressure and congestive heart failure, mental status change, or
stroke. Treatment is exchange transfusion.
Iron overload and its complications of end-organ damage become a
problem in those patients who are chronically transfused. Chelation is
recommended when the total-body iron level is elevated, as measured by
serum ferritin levels or, more reliably, serial liver biopsy. Chelation
therapy with deferoxamine (Desferal), which requires subcutaneous
overnight infusion, is an extremely time-consuming and inconvenient
therapy for the patient, in addition to being very expensive. This is one of
the motivating factors for a reduction in the number of transfusions and the
use of exchange transfusion in patients with SCD. Oral iron chelators, such
as deferasirox (Exjade), are now available, although not all patients can
afford or tolerate this drug. Patients with iron overload on chelation
therapy are at increased risk for infection with Yersinia enterocolitica.
COMPLICATIONS

Hematologic Complications

Acute exacerbations of anemia in the patient with SCD are a significant cause of
morbidity and mortality. The most common causes of these exacerbations are splenic
sequestrations and aplastic crises.
192

Acute splenic sequestration of blood is characterized by an exacerbation of
anemia, increased reticulocytosis, and a tender, enlarging spleen. Acute
sequestration can progress to hypovolemic shock and death. It is associated
with a 15% mortality rate, accounted for 6.6% of deaths in one autopsy series,
and is common in children with SCD-SS. Patients susceptible to splenic
sequestration are those whose spleens have not undergone fibrosis (i.e., young
patients with sickle cell anemia and adults with Hgb SC disease or S-beta+
thalassemia). Treatment is simple transfusion to restore blood volume and
red cell mass. Transfusion can lead to release of sequestered cells, and
overtransfusion and resulting hyperviscosity should be avoided. Because
splenic sequestration recurs in 50% of cases, splenectomy is recommended
after the event has abated. Acute sequestration can also occur in the liver.
Aplastic crises are transient arrests of erythropoiesis characterized by abrupt
falls in Hgb levels and decreased reticulocytosis. Given the decreased lifespan
of RBC in SCD, aplastic crises place patients at risk for severe anemia that is
frequently symptomatic. Parvovirus B19 accounts for the majority of aplastic
crises in children with SCD, but the high incidence of protective antibodies in
adults makes parvovirus a less frequent cause of aplasia. Intravenous immune
globulin can be used to treat parvovirus infection. Other infections have been
reported to cause transient aplasia. Aplastic crisis can also be the result of
bone marrow necrosis, which is characterized by fever, bone pain,
reticulocytopenia, and a leukoerythroblastic response. The mainstay of treating
aplastic crises is simple transfusion to correct severe anemia. SCD patients
in the peri-infection period are at increased risk for complications, including
pain crisis, ACS, and stroke. A useful guideline for transfusion is the
reticulocyte count. In parvovirus B19 infection, reticulocytopenia lasts 7 to 10
days. A patient having an exacerbation of a chronic anemia with an elevated
absolute reticulocyte count is less likely to require urgent transfusion than one
with a normal or low absolute reticulocyte count.
Hyperhemolytic crisis is the sudden exacerbation of anemia with increased
reticulocytosis and elevated bilirubin level. The usual therapy for a
hyperhemolytic crisis is simple transfusion. Most of these patients recover
within 14 days. The diagnosis of a delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction
should be considered in any patient receiving a recent blood transfusion.
Subacute anemia: The gradual onset of worsening anemia may be due to
developing renal insufficiency or folic acid deficiency. Chronic hemolysis
results in increased use of folic acid stores and can lead to megaloblastic crises
if nutritional supplementation is not used.
193

Acute Painful Crisis

Acute pain is the first symptom of disease in >25% of patients. The acute
painful episode is the most frequent reason for which patients with SCD seek
medical attention. There is tremendous variability of painful episodes within
genotypes and within the same patient over time. In one large study of patients
with sickle cell anemia, one-third rarely had pain, one-third were hospitalized
for pain approximately two to six times per year, and one-third had more than
six hospitalizations per year. More frequent pain crises are associated with
higher mortality rates. Pain episodes may be precipitated by temperature
extremes, dehydration, infection, hypoxia, acidosis, stress, menses, and alcohol
consumption. In addition, patients may cite that anxiety, depression, or physical
exhaustion may be precipitants. In many instances, no precipitating factors can
be identified. The painful episodes can occur in any area of the body, most
commonly the back, chest, extremities, and abdomen. In ~50% of painful
episodes, patients will present with objective clinical signs such as fever, joint
swelling, tenderness, tachypnea, hypertension, nausea, and vomiting. There is
no clinical or lab finding that is pathognomonic for painful crisis.
In general, the management of acute painful crises includes the identification
and treatment of possible precipitating factors, IV fluid hydration, and
analgesics. When a patient presents complaining of pain, the physician is
charged with ruling out etiologies other than vaso-occlusion. Acute painful
episodes generally last 4 to 6 days but may vary in intensity and duration. The
possibility that the pain is precipitated by a concurrent medical condition, such
as an infection, should be considered, and the physician should search for a
precipitating illness in every instance.
Providing aggressive relief of pain often requires the use of parenteral
narcotics. Patients will often be aware of the medications and dosages that have
provided adequate relief in the past, and they are often undertreated for pain. Of
note, patients with SCD do not respond to conventional doses of analgesia.
They typically are on chronic oral narcotics and may have developed a
tolerance to conventional doses of narcotics. Patient-controlled anesthesia
(PCA) pumps are effective in the treatment of an acute painful crisis.
Appropriate conversion between chronic PO medications and IV doses of
narcotics must be used to ensure adequate and prompt pain relief. In cases in
which there is no nausea or vomiting, patients are continued on the PO regimen
prescribed for continuous relief at home, and PCA-demand-only doses can be
added. Demerol may be used occasionally but should be avoided if possible.
Patients should be monitored frequently and objective pain scores followed
194

closely for titration of effective analgesia.
Painful events are not commonly associated with changes in the patient’s Hgb
levels, and transfusions are not indicated for simple acute painful crises.
Hydroxyurea reduces the frequency of painful crises.
Infections

Infections are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in SCD patients.
Outcomes for children improved with the use of prophylactic penicillin to prevent
Streptococcal pneumoniae sepsis. Although adults are less susceptible, all patients
should receive the pneumonia vaccinations. Adults with Hgb SS disease are
functionally asplenic and fever should be worked up aggressively with the
appropriate cultures, imaging studies, and consideration of prompt antibiotic
coverage. Patients with other geno-types are also at risk for infection, although they
are not always functionally asplenic. Sources of fever include sepsis, meningitis,
ACS, osteomyelitis, and urinary tract infection. In meningitis, empiric coverage
should include Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus infl uenzae. Coverage
for acute chest syndrome and osteomyelitis are discussed below.
Neurologic Complications

Neurologic complications are common in patients with SCD, including
transient ischemic attacks, cerebral infarction, cerebral hemorrhage, seizures,
spinal cord infarction or compression, CNS infections, vestibular dysfunction,
and sensory hearing loss. The risk for cerebral infarction, including clinical and
silent infarctions, is as high as 30%. The highest stroke rates occur in children,
and the risk of stroke by age 20 is 11%. Ischemic strokes 7 are more common in
children and those >30 years old, whereas hemorrhagic stroke is more common
at between 20 and 30 years of age.
Risk factors for strokes include severe anemia, low reticulocyte counts, low
Hgb F levels, high WBC counts, the Hgb SS genotype, ACS within the previous
2 weeks, and systolic hypertension.
Strokes are fatal in ~20% of initial cases, and 70% of patients will have a
recurrence within 3 years. Patients with symptoms and signs of an acute stroke
should be evaluated immediately. In those with hemorrhage, initial management
depends on the site and amount of bleeding. In children with infarcts, prompt
partial exchange transfusion is performed to reduce Hgb S to <30%.
Chronic exchange transfusion therapy to maintain Hgb S levels below 30%
has been shown to prevent recurrent thrombosis. At this time, it is unclear how
long chronic transfusion should be maintained. Prophylactic transfusions to
195

reduce Hgb S to <30% in children with abnormal transcranial Doppler velocity
measurements in cerebral blood vessels have been shown to reduce the risk of
first clinical stroke. Unfortunately, there are few systematic data on primary
prevention of stroke in adults with SCD. It is unclear whether acute ischemic
stroke in adults should be treated with immediate exchange transfusion as it is
in children, or whether it should be approached as it is in adults without SCD
(i.e., recombinant tissue plasminogen activator, aspirin, etc.) The role of
chronic transfusion for secondary prevention in adults is unclear.
Pulmonary Complications

One of the most feared acute pulmonary complications in SCD is acute chest
syndrome. 8,9 ACS is defined as a new infiltrate on chest x-ray (CXR) and
one or more of the following: fever, cough, chest pain, dyspnea, tachypnea,
and hypoxemia. Of note, the initial CXR may be negative. The definitive
etiology of ACS is not known but infection, vaso-occlusion and infarct, fat
embolism from necrotic marrow or a combination of these factors have been
implicated. It has been reported to occur in 29% of patients with SCD and can
progress to respiratory failure and death. ACS is the second most frequent
cause of hospitalization and the most frequent complication of surgery in SCD.
It should be noted, however, that nearly 50% of cases occur during
hospitalization for other causes.
Risk factors include prior episodes of ACS, Hgb SS, leukocytosis,
hospitalization for acute pain crisis, and high-baseline Hgb concentrations.
Atypical and typical bacterial pathogens and viruses, especially respiratory
syncytial virus (RSV), have been found in patients with ACS. Antibiotics are
indicated as initial therapy, preferably a cephalosporin and a macrolide or
fluoroquinolone.
Hypoxemia should be corrected by supplemental oxygen.
Analgesics and incentive spirometry to correct splinting from chest pain should
be initiated. Bronchodilators should be considered.
Either simple or exchange transfusion should be considered promptly if there
is a change in oxygen status from baseline. Simple transfusion can be used if
there is a need for increased O2-carrying capacity such as mild hypoxemia or
worsened anemia. Severe hypoxemia, clinical deterioration, or impending
respiratory failure should lead to urgent consideration of exchange transfusion.
Care in an intensive care unit and ventilator support may be required. ACS has
a mortality rate of ~10%. Chronic therapy with hydroxyurea can reduce the
frequency of episodes.
196

Chronic pulmonary disease is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in
patients with SCD. SCD patients may have restrictive and obstructive lung
diseases, pulmonary fibrosis, and pulmonary hypertension. Pulmonary disease
is more common in those with a history of ACS. Pulmonary hyper-tension
occurs in up to 32% of SCD patients and carries a poor prognosis, even with
mean pulmonary pressure elevations in the mild to moderate range.10 The
etiology of pulmonary hypertension in SCD is unknown, although chronic
intravascular hemolysis, which impairs normal vasodilation through its effects
on the nitric oxide pathway, may contribute. Diagnosis is made with cardiac
catheterization or echocardiogram-Doppler study. Patients presenting with
exertional dyspnea and findings of right heart failure should be evaluated
promptly. There are few data on the efficacy of different treatment modalities,
and maximizing supportive care, treating comorbid conditions, and employing
medications used in other patient populations with pulmonary hypertension may
be of benefit. These patients may be considered for hydroxyurea, pulmonary
vasodilators, anticoagulation, and home O2 therapy.
Hepatobiliary Complications

The prevalence of pigmented gallstones in SCD is directly related to the rate of
hemolysis. In sickle cell anemia, gallstones occur in children as young as 3 to 4
years and are eventually found in ~70% of patients. Patients presenting with
fever, nausea, vomiting, and right upper quadrant pain should be evaluated for
acute cholecystitis. Cholecystectomy should be considered even for
asymptomatic gallstones.
Hepatomegaly and liver dysfunction in SCD can be caused by multiple
etiologies, including intrahepatic blood sequestration, transfusion-acquired
hepatitis, transfusion-related iron overload, and very rarely autoimmune liver
disease. Hepatic sequestration is characterized by a rapidly enlarging liver,
decreased hematocrit, and rising reticulocyte count. Diagnosis is difficult, as
CT and ultrasound show only a diffusely enlarged liver, liver function tests may
be normal to moderately elevated, and the liver is variably tender. Both simple
and exchange transfusions have been used to treat hepatic sequestration. As in
splenic sequestration, care must be taken not to over-transfuse.
Benign cholestasis of SCD results in severe, asymptomatic hyperbilirubinemia
without fever, pain, leukocytosis, or hepatic failure. Progressive cholestasis
with right upper quadrant pain, marked elevations in bilirubin and alkaline
phosphatase, and progression to liver failure have been reported. These
patients are treated with exchange transfusion and supportive care. Another
197

serious complication is the hepatic crisis, in which hepatic ischemia results in
fever, right upper quadrant pain, leukocytosis, severe hyperbilirubinemia, and
abnormal liver function tests. It may progress to fulminant liver failure, which
has a dismal prognosis. Because of the nearly uniform mortality of this type of
hepatic crisis, exchange transfusion, plasmapheresis, and liver transplantation
have been used as therapy, but no controlled data are available to support this
approach.
Obstetric and Gynecologic Complications

Delayed menarche, dysmenorrhea, ovarian cysts, pelvic infection, and
fibrocystic disease of the breast are more common in women with SCD.
However, the major reproductive concern in these patients is pregnancy. The
improvement in fetal and maternal outcomes is largely due to improved
prenatal and high-risk obstetric care. The incidence of spontaneous abortion,
intrauterine growth retardation, pre-eclampsia, placental abruption, low birth
weight, and intrauterine fetal death are higher in women with SCD.
Maternal complications during pregnancy include increased rates of acute
painful episodes, severe anemia, infections, and even death. The course of
pregnancy is more benign in Hgb SC disease.
Therapeutic interventions for painful crises in pregnant women should be
identical to those in nonpregnant women, with IV hydration, attention to
complications, and adequate pain control. Opiates can affect fetal movement
and heart rate but are not teratogenic. Transfusions are generally reserved for
patients with worsening anemia (Hgb <6 g/dL) and in anticipation of surgery.
Hydroxyurea has been shown to be teratogenic in animals and should be
stopped in pregnancy. There is a very high incidence of acute painful episodes
associated with therapeutic abortions. Inpatient IV hydration immediately
before the procedure and for the 24 hours after the procedure is recommended.
Oral contraceptives containing low-dose estrogen are a safe, recommended
method of birth control in women with SCD.
Renal Complications

The kidney is particularly vulnerable to complications of SCD with
manifestations that result from medullary, distal and proximal tubular, and
glomerular abnormalities leading to the inability to concentrate the urine.
Papillary infarction with hematuria, renal tubular acidosis, and abnormal
potassium metabolism occur more commonly in patients with SCD or sickle
cell trait. Patients with hematuria should be evaluated with ultrasound.
198

Patients with SCD cannot excrete acid and potassium normally but usually do
not develop systemic acidosis or hyperkalemia without an additional acid load,
such as in the setting of renal insufficiency. Chronic renal insufficiency may be
predicted by albuminuria and should be suspected in the setting of hypertension
and worsening anemia.
Risk factors for the development of chronic renal failure include hypertension
and the use of anti-inflammatory drugs. The average age at onset of chronic
renal failure is 23 years in sickle cell anemia and 50 years in Hgb SC disease.
The use of ACE inhibitors was found to diminish proteinuria and pathological
glomerular changes; it is unclear whether their use slows the progression of
sickle nephropathy. Renal transplantation is recommended for patients with
end-stage renal failure.
Priapism11

Priapism affects 29% to 42% of males with SCD. It peaks in frequency at 1 to 5
and at 13 to 21 years of age. Priapism is most likely to develop in patients with
lower Hgb F levels and reticulocyte counts, increased platelet counts, and the
Hgb SS genotype.
First-line therapy is conservative, including increasing PO fluid intake and
anal-gesia. If the episode persists for 3 hours, the patient should seek medical
care. IV fluids, parenteral narcotics, and a Foley catheter to promote bladder
emptying are the initial treatments for acute priapism. If the episode lasts 4 to 6
hours, penile aspiration and irrigation as well as intracavernous injection of an
alpha-adrenergic agonist by a urologist should be performed. Partial exchange
transfusion can be considered, although efficacy has not been proved in
randomized controlled trials and it can be associated with complications in this
setting.
ASPEN syndrome (association of SCD, priapism, exchange transfusion, and
neurologic events), which involves headache, mental status change, neurologic
deficits, and stroke, has been described in SCD patients with priapism
undergoing exchange transfusion. It is important that initiation of transfusion
does not delay more definitive treatment.
If detumescence does not occur with nonsurgical management, a spongiosum–
cavernosum or cavernosaphenous vein shunt may be recommended.
Despite interventions, impotence remains a frequent complication of priapism.
There is a paucity of clinical trials for the secondary prevention of priapism,
although chronic transfusion according to stroke protocol, hydroxyurea, and
vasoactive agents such as pseudoephedrine are used at some centers.
199

Ocular Complications

Anterior chamber ischemia, retinal artery occlusion, and proliferative
retinopathy with the risk of subsequent hemorrhage and retinal detachment can
lead to vision loss in SCD. Sickle retinopathy is found most frequently between
15 and 30 years of age. Although found in all SCD, it is most frequent in Hgb
SC.
All patients who sustain eye trauma must be evaluated by an ophthalmologist
urgently because they are at increased risk of visual loss. Patients should
undergo a yearly retinal exam performed by an ophthalmologist. Sickle cell
retinopathy may require vision-improving therapy with laser photocoagulation.
Bone Complications

Bone and joint problems are a common cause of both acute and chronic pain in
SCD. Erythroid hyperplasia secondary to chronic hemolytic anemia leads to
widening of the medullary space and thinning of the trabeculae and cortices.
This results in bony distortion, especially in the skull, vertebrae, and long
bones. Vaso-occlusion and subsequent bone and marrow infarct are common,
especially in the spine, ribs, and long bones.
Dactylitis, painful swelling of the hands and feet, is caused by microinfarcts of
the phalanges and metatarsals and usually occurs in early childhood.
Osteonecrosis occurs in all SCD phenotypes but most frequently in sickle cell
anemia with coexistent alpha thalassemia. Osteonecrosis occurs in both the
femoral and the humeral heads, as well as in the vertebral bodies. The femoral
heads more commonly undergo GS progressive destruction as a result of
chronic weightbearing. MRI is the most accurate imaging study to diagnose
avascular necrosis of the femoral head. Core decompression surgery to relieve
increased intraosseous pressure can be used in early-stage osteonecrosis. A
patient with more advanced disease is a candidate for total hip arthroplasty.
This decision must take into account the likelihood that a second hip revision
may be required and that there are more complications and a relatively high
failure rate in patients with SCD compared to other patient populations.
Vertebral infarction also occurs and leads to chronic back pain.
Osteomyelitis must be differentiated from the more common bone infarction,
because the two syndromes present with similar clinical and imaging findings
but are treated very differently. Staphylococcus and salmonella are common
pathogens for osteomyelitis in sickle cell patients. Increasing antibiotic
resistance to salmonella is a major problem in SCD. Septic arthritis must also
200

be distinguished from the more common joint effusion associated with acute
painful episodes. Bone biopsy and culture are the most reliable tests to
establish the diagnosis before starting long-term antibiotics.
Dermatologic Complications

Skin ulcers are major causes of morbidity in SCD. Ulcers occur commonly near
the medial or lateral malleolus and are frequently bilateral. About 2.5% of patients
age 10 and older develop leg ulcers. Ulcers may begin spontaneously or as a result
of trauma. They are commonly infected with Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas,
streptococci, or Bacteroides species. Males have a threefold greater risk of
developing leg ulcers. Therapy with gentle débridement, wet-to-dry dressings, and
compression bandages is typically effective. Compression stockings may be used to
prevent recurrence.
Cardiac Complications

An important cardiac consideration in the management of patients with SCD is
the high cardiac output related to chronic anemia. Chronic high cardiac output can
result in four-chamber enlargement and cardiomegaly. Age-dependent loss of
cardiac reserve can lead to a greater risk of heart failure in adult patients during
fluid overload, transfusion, or other reduced O2-carrying capacity states. Acute
myocardial infarction in the absence of coronary disease has been reported but is
rare.

GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Hemostasis is a regulatory process with two functions: (1) maintain clot-free
blood flow and (2) aggressively respond to localized vascular injury with formation
of a hemostatic plug. Aberrancies in this system can cause either thrombus formation
or uncontrolled bleeding. When hemostasis is inappropriately or overexuberantly
activated, anticoagulants or thrombolytics are used to moderate this process, with
a potential risk of bleeding. Procoagulants are used to stop bleeding, reverse the
effects of anticoagulation medications, or replenish factors required for clot
formation and stabilization.
Normal Hemostasis

Endothelial cells line the inner surface of blood vessels. These cells produce
vasodilators that prevent platelet aggregation and block the coagulation cascade,
thrombus formation, and fibrin deposition. Disruption of endothelial cells bares the
subendothelial extracellular matrix (ECM), which promotes platelet adherence and
activation and exposes tissue factor, a membrane-bound procoagulant factor. Tissue
factor, in conjunction with secreted platelet factors, induces platelet aggregation and
activates the coagulation cascade. This converts prothrombin to thrombin (factor
IIa), which forms the initial hemostatic plug. Thrombin converts fibrinogen to
insoluble fibrin, which forms a permanent plug.
The coagulation cascade (Fig. 12-1) is a series of enzymatic reactions with
feedback promotion and inhibition that regulate and restrict the process of
hemostasis to the site of vascular injury. A deficiency of procoagulant factors or
cofactors, such as vitamin K (necessary for the function of factors II, VII, IX, and X),
can cause bleeding; whereas low levels or decreased function of factors involved in
203

limiting coagulation can trigger thrombosis.
The adhesion of platelets (Fig. 12-2) to exposed collagen is mediated by von
Willebrand factor (vWF), which links collagen fibrils to the surface of platelets.
Activated platelets release factors such as thromboxane A2 (TXA2) and adenosine
diphosphate (ADP), which bind to their respective receptors. This initiates a series
of enzymatic reactions that decrease cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)
levels and promote the release of the same factors to recruit additional platelets.
Recruited platelets are connected by fibrin cross-linking of glycoprotein (GP)
IIb/IIIa receptors.
ANTICOAGULANTS: AGENTS THAT PREVENT THROMBOSIS

Antiplatelet Drugs 1
Aspirin

Mechanism of action. Aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) irreversibly inhibits cyclooxygen-ase-1 (COX-1) in platelets, blocking the conversion of arachidonic acid to
TXA 2, which is involved in the recruitment and aggregation of platelets. A minimum
dose of 160 mg of aspirin is required to maximally inhibit platelet function within 30
minutes. The effect of aspirin remains for the life span of the platelet (8 to 10 days).
Normal hemostasis is regained when 20% of platelets have normal COX-1 activity.

204

Figure 12-1. The coagulation cascade. The coagulation cascade is divided into
two pathways: extrinsic and intrinsic, which converge at factor X, the start of the
common pathway leading to thrombin formation and fibrin cross-linking. The
extrinsic pathway is activated by tissue factor. Contact with subendothelial surfaces
or a negatively charged surface activates factor XII (Hageman factor) and starts the
intrinsic coagulation cascade. (Diagram modified from Kumar V. Robbins & Cotran
Pathologic Basis of Disease. Philadelphia: W. B. Saunders; 2004: Fig. 4-9.)

205

Figure 12.2 Mechanisms implicated in platelet adhesion, activation, and
aggregation. Aspirin irreversibly inhibits thromboxane A 2 (TXA 2) synthesis,
dipyridamole increases cAMP levels, clopidogrel irreversibly modifi es the ADP
receptor, and abciximab antagonizes the glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor. (Hankey GJ
and Eikelboom JW. Antiplatelet drugs. MJA 2003;178:568–574. © Copyright 2003
The Medical Journal of Australia—reproduced with permission.)
Preparation and dosage. Aspirin is absorbed through the mucous membranes
of the gastrointestinal tract, achieving peak levels between 30 and 60 minutes,
depending on dosage, formulation, and physiologic factors. Aspirin is hydrolyzed in
the plasma, conjugated in the liver, and then primarily cleared by the kidneys. In the
United States, aspirin is available as 81- or 325-mg doses.
Clinical indications 2,3
Ischemic stroke and transient ischemic attack (TIA). In patients
with a history of stroke or ischemia due to fibrin platelet emboli, aspirin
therapy (50 to 325 mg daily) reduces the combined end point of TIA,
stroke, and death by 13% to 18%.
Suspected acute myocardial infarction (MI). Aspirin treatment in
patients with acute coronary syndrome reduces vascular mortality by
23%. Patients are asked to chew the aspirin tablet(s) (160 to 325 mg) to
enhance absorption due to formulation variability.
206

Prevention of recurrent MI and unstable angina. Aspirin therapy
(75 to 325 mg daily) in patients with a history of MI is associated with a
20% reduction in death and reinfarction. A 5% to 10% decrease in event
rate is observed in patients with unstable angina.
Chronic stable angina. Aspirin reduces the risk of nonfatal MI, fatal MI,
and sudden death by 34%. The secondary end point for vascular events
(first occur-rence of MI, stroke, or vascular death) is decreased by 32%.
Revascularization procedure. Lifelong aspirin is recommended for
patients who undergo cardiac or peripheral revascularization, if there is a
preexisting condition for which aspirin is already indicated.
Adverse effects. Common side effects of aspirin include stomach pain, nausea,
vomiting, dyspepsia, and risk of gastrointestinal bleeding. Some of these effects can
be moderated by enteric coating, which protects the gastric mucosa. Aspirin may
cause urticaria, angioedema, and bronchospasm. It is contraindicated in patients with
a known allergy to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and in patients with the
syndrome of asthma, rhinitis, and nasal polyps. Aspirin should not be used in
children with viral illness because of the risk of Reye syndrome.
Overdose. The earliest sign of salicylate toxicity is tinnitus (ringing in the
ears). Respiratory alkalosis occurs early but is quickly followed by metabolic
acidosis. Treatment is supportive.
Dipyridamole

Mechanism of action. Dipyridamole (Aggrenox, Persantine) reversibly inhibits
the uptake of adenosine into platelets and endothelial cells, increasing cAMP levels
and, therefore, inhibiting platelet response to recruitment factors. Dipyridamole also
inhibits tissue phosphodiesterase, augments the antiplatelet adhesion effects of nitric
oxide, and stimulates prostacyclin release, thereby inhibiting TXA 2 formation.
Preparation and dosage. Peak levels of dipyridamole are generally achieved
2 hours after ingestion (range, 1 to 6 hours). Metabolism occurs by liver conjugation
and excretion through the gastrointestinal tract. Aggrenox is available as a capsule
containing 25 mg of aspirin and 200 mg of extended-release dipyridamole.
Persantine is available as 25-, 50-, and 75-mg tablets.
Clinical indications.4 In patients with a history of ischemic stroke or TIA,
Aggrenox reduces the risk of subsequent stroke compared to therapy with aspirin
alone.
Adverse effects. Aggrenox and Persantine have a gastrointestinal side-effect
profile similar to that of aspirin, with twice the rate of headache and dizziness.
Serious side effects include thrombocytopenia.
207

Clopidogrel

Mechanism of action. Clopidogrel (Plavix) irreversibly modifies the ADP
receptor on platelets, inhibiting the binding of ADP to its receptor and the
subsequent activation of the GPIIb/IIIa complex involved in platelet aggregation.
Preparation and dosage. Peak levels of clopidogrel occur 1 hour after tablet
ingestion. Metabolism occurs by hydrolysis and renal excretion. Plavix is available
as a 75-mg tablet
.
Clinical indications
Recent MI, recent stroke, or established peripheral vascular
disease. The CAPRIE study compared a daily dose of 325 mg aspirin to
75 mg clopidogrel and demonstrated a relative risk reduction of 7% for
fatal and nonfatal MI, stroke, and overall event rate in the clopidogreltreated group.
Acute coronary syndrome. The CURE study demonstrated that
patients presenting with a non-ST-elevation MI within 24 hours of the
onset of symptoms had a 20% relative risk reduction in cardiovascular
death, MI, or stroke when treated with an oral load of clopidogrel in
addition to standard therapies (aspirin and heparin, no GPIIb/IIIareceptor blocker 3 days prior to randomization) compared to patients
receiving only standard therapies.
Adverse effects. Clopidogrel is associated with a higher rate of rash, diarrhea,
and gastrointestinal bleeding compared to aspirin. The combination of clopidogrel
and aspirin versus aspirin alone increases the risk of major bleeding (3.7% vs.
2.7%, respectively). There is a rare association with thrombotic thrombocytopenic
purpura after short exposure (<2 weeks). Ticlopidine (Ticlid) is chemically similar
to clopidogrel and is associated with a 0.8% risk of severe agranulocytosis. There
was no difference in the incidence of agranulocytosis between the clopidogrel- and
the aspirin-treated groups.
Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa Antagonists

Mechanism of action. Abciximab (ReoPro), tirofiban (Aggrastat), and
eptifibatide (Integrilin) are GPIIb/IIIa antagonists. Abciximab is the Fab fragment of
the chimeric human-murine monoclonal antibody, which binds to and causes a
conformational change in the GPIIb/IIIa receptor, preventing the binding of platelet
“glue”—fibrinogen or vWF. Abciximab also blocks other procoagulant properties of
platelets and leukocytes. Tirofiban (a nonpeptide) and eptifibatide (a cyclic
208

heptapeptide) are reversible antagonists of the GPIIb/IIIa receptor. GPIIb/IIIa
inhibitors are intended for use with aspirin and heparin.
Preparation and dosage. Following IV bolus administration, plasma levels of
abciximab decrease rapidly, with a half-life of <10 minutes. The second half-life is
about 30 minutes, likely related to dose-dependent reversible binding of the GPIIb/
IIIa receptor. Platelet function recovers over 48 hours, although abciximab remains
in the circulation for 15 days. Within 30 minutes of tirofiban infusion, >90% platelet
inhibition is obtained. The half-life is ~ 2 hours, with clearance largely influenced
by renal function; however, tirofiban can be dialyzed out of circulation, if needed.
The pharmacokinetics of eptifibatide is essentially the same as that of tirofiban.
Clinical indications3
Abciximab. Following percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or
atherectomy, an IV abciximab bolus (0.25 mg/kg) followed by an
infusion (0.125 μg/kg/min × 12 hours) decreases the composite of
death, MI, and urgent intervention for recurrent ischemia in the first 48
hours postprocedure, a benefit that extended to 3 years. The CAPTURE
trial demonstrated a lower preintervention and 30-day postintervention
MI rate with IV abciximab. However, there was no mortality benefit at 1
or 6 months and no difference in event rate between the abciximabtreated and the placebo groups.
Tirofiban. In a study of patients undergoing PCI or arthrectomy,
tirofiban (with heparin therapy) decreased the composite end point
(death, new MI, refractory ischemia, and repeat cardiac procedure) by
32%.
Eptifibatide. Eptifibatide infusion prior to PCI decreased the composite
end point of death, MI, and urgent intervention by 1% at 30 days, and
this benefit extended to 1 year.
Adverse effects. GPIIb/IIIa receptor blockers are associated with
thrombocytopenia, which can be severe.
Anticoagulation Drugs

Anticoagulants interfere with the coagulation cascade, reducing the generation of
thrombin and the buttressing effects of fibrin.
Warfarin

Mechanism of action. Warfarin (Coumadin) is an anticoagulant that acts by
inhibiting the synthesis of vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors (II, VII, IX, and
209

X, proteins C and S). Since the half-lives of proteins C and S are about one-third the
half-life of the other vitamin K-dependent procoagulation factors, patients are briefly
hypercoagulable before anticoagulation effects take place. For this reason, patients
are often bridged with heparin, as they become therapeutic on warfarin.
Preparation and dosage. The anticoagulation effects of warfarin occur within
24 hours of ingestion, peaking at 72 to 96 hours and lasting 2 to 5 days. Cytochrome
P-450 is involved in the metabolism of warfarin. Drugs that affect P-450 expression
will alter the metabolism of warfarin and affect International Normalized Ratio
(INR) levels. Warfarin is available in multiple-dose tablets, and therapy requires
periodic INR monitoring. For more detailed suggestions on dosage initiation for
warfarin, visit www.WarfarinDosing.org.
Clinical indications
Deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE).
Current recommendation for anticoagulation in patients with an initial
event and reversible risk factor for DVT or PE is 6 to 12 months.
Recurrent thromboembolic disease warrants a hypercoagulable workup,
and studies suggest a benefit of lifelong anticoagulation therapy (goal
INR, 2 to 3).
Atrial fibrillation. Prospective trials of patients with atrial fibrillation
show a risk reduction of 60% to 86% in systemic thromboembolism and
less bleeding in the low INR range (1.4 to 3.0) compared to the high INR
range (2.0 to 4.5).
MI. Warfarin can be used postinfarction to reduce the risk of recurrent
MI and stroke. Some cardiologists would consider discontinuing
anticoagulation 2 to 3 months postinfarction if wall motion abnormalities
on echocardiography have resolved.
Mechanical and bioprosthetic valves. Anticoagulation with warfarin
is generally not required in the management of bioprosthetic valves. A
goal INR of 2.5 to 3.5 is generally recommended for mechanical aortic
and mitral valve replacements, with the following exceptions: aortic St.
Jude’s and other bileaflet aortic values can be maintained with an INR of
2 to 3. A subtherapeutic INR or need to change quickly the
anticoagulation status is usually managed with IV heparin.

210

Adverse effects. Warfarin is associated with a significant risk of hemorrhage,
which is associated with higher INR levels. The anticoagulation effects of warfarin
can be reversed within 1 to 3 days with oral or IV vitamin K (Table 12-1).
Immediate reversal of anticoagulation can be achieved with administration of freshfrozen plasma (FFP). Warfarin is contraindicated in pregnancy due to teratogenic
effects and the risk of fetal hemorrhage. Warfarin-induced skin necrosis
(microthrombi due to earlier deficiency of proteins C and S compared to other
vitamin K factors) is a rare complication of therapy; it occurs in areas of highpercentage adipose tissue and may become life threatening.
Unfractionated Heparin

Mechanism of action. Unfractionated heparin is a polysaccharide that binds to
anti-thrombin III (ATIII) and increases the rate of ATIII inactivation of thrombin (II)
and factor Xa.
Preparation and dosage. Heparin is administered IV or SC, based on patient
lean body weight and clinical context (Table 12-2). IV heparin is monitored by
measuring the partial thromboplastin time (PTT). Discontinuation of IV heparin
results in normalization of anticoagulation within 2 to 3 hours.

211

Clinical indications
Anticoagulation bridge therapy. Heparin is used as bridge therapy to
initiate and discontinue anticoagulation in patients with prosthetic heart
valves (to prevent valve thrombosis) and thrombotic disease.
Prophylaxis. Hospitalized patients at significant risk for developing DVT
and associated sequelae are given SC heparin (5000 U bid or tid) to
decrease the incidence of thrombotic disease.
Acute coronary syndrome and vascular surgery. The advantage of
heparin is immediate anticoagulation.
Invasive lines and catheters. Invasive pressure catheters and lines
are flushed with heparin to prevent catheter clotting.
Adverse effects. Heparin is associated with a risk of bleeding. Rapid reversal
of heparin can be achieved by infusion of protamine sulfate (1 mg protamine
reverses 100 units of circulating heparin). Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT)
is a complication that results in a rapid fall in platelet number (see Chap. 4).
Suspicion of HIT should prompt discontinuation of heparin; platelet counts generally
recover within 1 to 2 weeks. Warfarin should be avoided in acute HIT, unless
combined with another anticoagulant while the INR is subtherapeutic.
Low-Molecular-Weight Heparin

Mechanism of action. Enoxaparin (Lovenox) is a low-molecular-weight
heparin that inhibits thrombin (factor IIa) and factor Xa.
212

Preparation and dosage. Enoxaparin is administered SC. Maximum activity
occurs 3 to 5 hours after SC injection, and it is administered every 12 hours, except
in patients with renal impairment, in whom once-daily dosing is sufficient for
anticoagulation.
Clinical indications
Prophylaxis of deep venous thrombosis. Enoxaparin is used to
prevent thrombosis complications in patients with orthopedic, general
surgical, or medical problems requiring prolonged immobilization
(walking ≤10 m for ≤3 days). The prophylactic dose is 40 mg SC every
24 hours or 30 mg SC every 12 hours.
Prophylaxis of ischemic complications of unstable angina. Dose is
1 mg/kg lean body weight SC every 12 hours.
Treatment of deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism.
1 mg/ kg lean body weight SC every 12 hours.
Adverse effects. Bleeding is a complication of enoxaparin, and no therapy to
reverse anticoagulation is available. Thrombocytopenia occurs in about 1% of
patients. A drop in platelet count to <100,000/mm3 should prompt discontinuation of
this medication. Patients with HIT from heparin therapy are at risk for enoxaparininduced thrombocytopenia; thus other anticoagulation drugs are preferred in these
situations. The use of enoxaparin for thromboprophylaxis in pregnant women and in
patients with mechanical valves has not been thoroughly studied.
Fondaparinux

Mechanism of action. Fondaparinux (Arixtra) binds to ATIII and selectively
inhibits factor Xa.
Preparation and dosage. A therapeutic level of fondaparinux is achieved
within 2 hours of SC injection and is eliminated by renal excretion. Multiple
prefilled syringe doses are available. Dosing is based on body weight: 5 mg (<50
kg), 7.5 mg (50 to 100 kg), and 10 mg (> 100 kg) SC daily.
Clinical indications
Prophylaxis. Fondaparinux is indicated for DVT prophylaxis in patients
undergoing orthopedic and general surgery procedures.
DVT and PE. Fondaparinux is approved as bridge therapy for
anticoagulation with warfarin.
Adverse effects. Fondaparinux carries a slightly higher risk of hemorrhage
compared to enoxaparin (4% vs. 3%, respectively) and similar rates of
thrombocytopenia. There is no antidote for fondaparinux.
Hirudin Derivatives

213

Mechanism of action. Lepirudin (Refludan) and bivalirudin (Angiomax) are
recombinant hirudin polypeptides that directly inhibit thrombin. The hirudins were
originally isolated from leech saliva but are now derived from recombinant DNA in
yeast cells.
Preparation and dosage. The half-life of lepirudin is 10 minutes and that of
bivalirudin is 25 minutes. Metabolism occurs by catabolic hydrolysis. The half-life
is prolonged in patients with creatinine clearance ≤15 mL/min. Lepirudin and
bivalirudin dosages are adjusted by PTT, checked 2 hours after the start or a change
in infusion rate.
Clinical indications5
Lepirudin is indicated for anticoagulation in patients with HIT and
associated thromboembolic disease, at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg bolus, then
0.15 mg/kg/min (up to 110 kg), to target PTT of 45 to 70 seconds.
Bivalirudin. In patients with HIT, dosing is 0.08 to 0.1 mg/kg/h for CrCl
≥30 mL/min or 0.04 to 0.06 mg/kg/h for CrCl <30 mL/min, to target PTT
of 45 to 70 seconds. Bivalirudin can also be used in patients undergoing
PCI (0.75 mg/kg bolus prior to intervention, then 1.75 mg/kg/h for the
duration of the procedure, and up to 4 hours postprocedure); in acute
coronary syndrome (0.1 mg/kg bolus, then 0.25 mg/kg/h); and as
anticoagulation with streptokinase thrombolysis in ST-elevation MI and
known HIT (0.25 mg/kg bolus 3 minutes before streptokinase, followed
by 0.5 mg/kg/h × 12 hours, then 0.25 mg/kg/h × 36 hours).
Adverse effects. Antihirudin antibodies are observed in 40% of HIT patients
treated with lepirudin. Back pain and nausea are common side effects of hirudin
derivatives. There are reports of hypersensitivity and allergic reactions and liver
function test abnormalities.
Argatroban

Mechanism of action. Argatroban is a synthetic derivative of L-arginine that
directly inhibits thrombin by reversibly binding to the thrombin active site.
Preparation and dosage. Argatroban is 54% protein bound and is metabolized
by the liver. Its half-life is 39 to 51 minutes. No dosage adjustment is necessary in
renal dysfunction; however, the dosage should be adjusted in hepatic impairment
(0.5 μg/kg/min). The INR may be falsely elevated with therapy.
Clinical indications.5 Argatroban is used for prophylaxis or treatment of
thrombosis in patients with HIT (0.5 to 2 μg/kg/min until PTT is 1.5 to 3 × baseline)
or as anticoagulation in patients with HIT undergoing PCI.
Adverse effects. Argatroban prolongs the INR with warfarin and should be
214

discontinued when the INR is >4 on combined therapy. Fever and diarrhea are
frequent side effects. Hypotension can occur with infusion.
Dabigatran

Mechanism of action. Dabigatran is an oral direct thrombin inhibitor.
Preparation and dosage. The approved dose is 150 mg PO bid. Dose
reduction to 75 mg bid is indicated in patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine
clearance 15 to 30 mL/min).
Clinical indications. Dabigatran is indicated to reduce the risk of stroke in
patients with atrial fibrillation. In a randomized trial, dabigatran was as effective as
warfarin in the treatment of acute DVT.6
Adverse effects. The primary risk is bleeding. Dabigatran should be
discontinued 1 to 2 days before an invasive procedure or surgery (3 to 5 days in
patients with renal insufficiency). No INR monitoring is required.
THROMBOLYTICS
AND
DISINTEGRAE CLOT

FIBRINOLYTICS:

AGENTS

THAT

Thrombolytics and fibrinolytics convert plasminogen to the active enzyme
plasmin, which digests fibrin clots (Table 12-3). Allergic reactions to these agents
have been reported, particularly streptokinase and urokinase. The most commonly
reported reactions to streptokinase are fever and shivering (1% to 4%).
Anaphylactic shock is much rarer, occurring in <0.1% of patients. To anticipate
allergic reaction to streptokinase, an intradermal test dose of 100 IU has been
suggested. Hypersensitivity reactions should be treated with adrenergic,
corticosteroid, and/or antihistamine agents as needed.
The major risk of thrombolytics and fibrinolytics is bleeding. Relative
contraindications to their use include the following:
Recent surgery (within 10 days)
Gastrointestinal bleeding
Trauma, including intracranial or intraspinal trauma or surgery within the
previous 3 months
Known intracranial neoplasm, arteriovenous malformation, or aneurysm
Known bleeding diathesis or INR 1.7
Platelet count <100,000/mm3
Systolic blood pressure >180 mm Hg or diastolic pressure >110 mm Hg
Subacute bacterial endocarditis
215

Pregnancy
Cerebrovascular disease
In these situations, the bleeding risk must be weighed against the benefits of
thrombolysis.
COAGULANTS: AGENTS THAT TREAT BLEEDING

Desmopressin

Mechanism of action. Desmopressin (DDAVP) is a synthetic version of the
naturally occurring pituitary hormone vasopressin (ADH). In patients with type 1
von Willebrand disease (vWD) and mild hemophilia A, desmopressin transiently
increases plasma levels of vWF and factor VIII.

216

Preparation and dosage. Desmopressin can be administered intranasally, SC,
IV, or orally. The dose and route of administration depend on the clinical context.
The half-life of desmopressin given IV is 3 hours, and the drug is metabolized
primarily by the kidney.
Clinical indications
Hemophilia A. Desmopressin is used in patients with hemophilia A prior
to surgery or patients who have spontaneous bleeding.
vWD (type 1). Studies have demonstrated that patients with type 1
vWD have a qualitatively normal vWF and respond to desmopressin,
unlike patients with type 2 vWD, who synthesize a qualitatively
217

abnormal vWF.7
Adverse effects. Desmopressin has been associated with headaches,
tachycardia, and facial flushing. Other side effects include rhinitis, stomach cramps,
vulvar pain, and vomiting. In patients receiving repeated doses of the medication,
tachyphylaxis can occur. Patients taking desmopressin should be educated to limit
fluid intake to satisfaction of thirst only, as hyponatremia may occur via the ADH
effect of the drug. Consequently, children taking this medication should have their
body weight routinely monitored. Rarely, water intoxication and coma can occur.
Vitamin K

Mechanism of action. Phytonadione (vitamin K) is a fat-soluble vitamin
required by the liver for synthesis of clotting factors II, VII, IX, and X. Vitamin K is
derived from green, leafy vegetables and is also produced by bacteria in the
digestive tract. It is given to reverse the effects of warfarin.
Preparation and dosage. Vitamin K can be taken orally from 2.5 mg to a
maximum dose of 25 mg. Alternatively, the drug can be given SC, IM, or IV at doses
ranging from 1 to 10 mg. Vitamin K is metabolized in the liver and excreted in the
bile.
Clinical indications.8 Vitamin K can be administered to reverse the effects of
warfarin. See section on warfarin (above) for more details.
Adverse effects. Reactions to vitamin K include taste changes, flushing,
dizziness, and hypotension. Severe anaphylaxis reactions and death have been
reported following parenteral administration of the drug. Hyperbilirubinemia can be
seen in infants, following administration of the drug.
Aminocaproic Acid

Mechanism of action. Aminocaproic acid (Amicar) inhibits fibrinolysis by
inhibiting plasminogen activators. It is often used to treat excessive postoperative
bleeding, as well as gingival bleeding in hemophiliacs undergoing dental work.
Preparation and dosage. Aminocaproic acid can be administered orally or IV.
The drug comes in 500- or 1000-mg tablets and 250-mg syrup or injectable vials.
Aminocaproic acid is metabolized in the liver and is primarily excreted in urine. For
treatment of acute bleeding, dosing is 5 g IV or PO over 1 hour, followed by 1 g/h IV
or PO for 8 hours or until bleeding is controlled.
Clinical indications. Aminocaproic acid can improve hemostasis when
hemorrhage is due in part or whole to fibrinolysis, including the following
situations: after cardiac surgery, thrombocytopenic hematologic disorders, severe
218

abruption placentae, hepatic cirrhosis, and various malignancies. Studies have
shown aminocaproic acid to be safe and efficacious as an adjunctive therapy for
hemophiliacs undergoing dental procedures.
Adverse effects. Side effects include abdominal pain, diarrhea, pruritus,
headache, malaise, allergic reactions, thrombocytopenia, hypotension, convulsions,
dyspnea, rash, and tinnitus. Rarely, rhabdomyolysis and acute renal failure can occur
with this medication. Creatinine phosphokinase (CPK) monitoring should occur
regularly in patients undergoing long-term therapy, and the drug should be
discontinued if elevations of the enzyme are noted.
Protamine

Mechanism of action. Protamine sulfate is a parenterally administered
medication used to treat heparin overdose. It binds heparin and forms a stable
complex, which negates the anticoagulation effects of heparin. When given alone,
protamine has a mild anticoagulant effect.
Preparation and dosage. Protamine has a rapid onset of action, and the
reversal of heparin occurs within 5 minutes after administering the drug. One
milligram of protamine neutralizes approximately 100 units of heparin. It is given at
a rate of 5 mg/min IV over 10 minutes, and the dose should not exceed 50 mg at one
time.
Clinical indications. Protamine is used to treat heparin overdose. It can also be
used to treat bleeding complications in patients undergoing PCI.
Adverse effects. Following administration of protamine, patients may
experience hypotension and bradycardia. Other effects include nausea, vomiting,
dyspnea, flushing, and fatigue. Severe reactions to protamine include anaphylaxis
and anaphylactoid reactions. Some penicillins and cephalosporins have been shown
to be incompatible with protamine. Protamine overdoses may cause bleeding.
Humate-P

Mechanism of action. Humate-P (antihemophilic factor/vWF complex) is a
product pooled from human plasma, which contains factor VIII and vWF.
Administration of Humate-P promotes coagulation. It is approved for the treatment
of (1) bleeding in hemophilia A patients, (2) bleeding in patients with severe vWD,
and (3) patients with mild to moderate vWD in whom desmopressin is ineffective.
Preparation and dosage. Dosage of Humate-P depends on patient weight,
severity of bleeding, and vWF:RCo (ristocetin cofactor) activity. Dosage is
calculated as (patient’s weight [kg] × desired % increase in VFW activity) ÷ 1.5.
The dose can be adjusted for the extent of bleeding.
219

Clinical indications. Humate-P has 95% efficacy when used to control bleeding
in patients with vWD (types 1, 2A, 2B, and 3).9
Adverse effects. As Humate-P is derived from human plasma, it carries a risk
of transmission of infectious agents. Common side effects include flushing, chills,
fever, dizziness, and headache. Although allergic reactions have been reported,
severe anaphylaxis is rare.
Recombinant Coagulation Factor VIIa

Mechanism of action. Coagulation factor VIIa (NovoSeven) is a recombinant
human coagulation factor approved for bleeding in patients with hemophilia A or B
with inhibitors or in patients with congenital factor VII deficiency. NovoSeven
works by activating the extrinsic pathway of coagulation.
Preparation and dosage. NovoSeven is administered IV, and the dosage
depends on the clinical context. For hemophiliacs with bleeding episodes, 90 μg/kg
is given every 2 hours until bleeding stops. In patients with congenital factor VII
deficiency, NovoSeven is given at 15 to 30 μg/kg every 4 to 6 hours until cessation
of bleeding.
Clinical indications. NovoSeven has been shown to be at least partially
effective in 85% of serious bleeding episodes.10
Adverse effects. As with any recombinant product, anaphylaxis is a potential
side effect. NovoSeven is contraindicated in patients who have a known allergic
reaction to mouse, hamster, or cow products. Common side effects include bleeding,
fever, and hypertension. There is a slightly increased risk of thrombosis after
administration of the medication.

INTRODUCTION TO PLASMA CELL DISORDERS
Plasma cell disorders encompass a group of hematologic malignancies
characterized by neoplastic clonal proliferation of plasma cells producing a
monoclonal protein. The range and severity of diseases are broad and include
multiple myeloma (MM), monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance
(MGUS), Waldenström macroglobulinemia (WM), and amyloidosis. The
monoclonal protein (M protein) varies by disease entity; MM generally produces
IgG and IgA, whereas WM is caused by IgM gammopathy.

MULTIPLE MYELOMA

GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Multiple myeloma (MM) results when there is neoplastic clonal proliferation of
plasma cells resulting in production of a monoclonal immunoglobulin (Ig), also
known as the M protein, which is present in the blood and/or urine. Lytic bone
lesions in MM result from disruption of the normal bone remodeling process, caused
by upregulation of osteoclasts, inhibition of osteoblasts, and interactions with bone
marrow stromal cells. Even with adequate therapy, the lytic lesions remain, and new
bone formation does not occur.
Epidemiology

222

In the United States, ~5.6 of 100,000 people are diagnosed with MM each year.
In 2010, 20,180 new cases were diagnosed and 10,650 deaths occurred.
DIAGNOSIS

Clinical Presentation

Presentation of MM can be nonspecific, including complaints of fatigue, bone
pain, weight loss, parasthesias/neuropathy, and recurrent bacterial infections. The
hallmark of the disease is bone destruction, and 85% of patients have lytic lesions or
diffuse osteopenia at diagnosis. Approximately 60% of patients develop pathologic
fractures and 66% have symptomatic bone pain. MM can be associated with
plasmacytomas that invade vertebrae which may result in vertebral fracture or
neurologic emergencies such as cord compression.
Diagnostic Criteria

The International Myeloma Working Group and Mayo Clinic developed
diagnostic criteria for MM, refined in 2003. All three criteria must be met:
Presence of a serum and/or urine monoclonal protein (except in patients
with true nonsecretory MM)
Presence of clonal bone marrow plasma cells ≥10%
Presence of end-organ damage attributed to the plasma cell disorder such
as hypercalcemia; renal insufficiency; normochromic/normocytic anemia;
or bone lesions (lytic lesions, osteopenia, or fracture)
A diagnosis of smoldering MM (SMM), sometimes called asymptomatic MM,
is made by meeting both of the following criteria:
Serum monoclonal protein ≥3 g/dL and/or clonal bone marrow plasma
cells ≥10%
Absence of end-organ damage attributed to the plasma cell disorder
Smoldering MM progresses to MM at a rate of approximately 10% per year1.
Diagnostic Testing
Laboratories

All patients suspected of having MM should undergo an extensive workup.
Initial laboratories should include CBC, electrolytes, BUN, creatinine, and calcium.
223

Examination of the peripheral blood smear may reveal presence of rouleaux
formation. A serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP) with immunofixation,
quantitative immunoglobulins, and measurement of serum-free light chains should be
performed. Once the diagnosis of a plasma cell disorder is established, 24-hour
urine, urine protein electrophoresis (UPEP) and immunofixation are needed. LDH
can be measured to reflect tumor burden, while serum β2 -microglobulin and albumin
serve as important prognostic indicators. An M protein is detectable in the serum of
~90% of patients with MM, with 50% of patients having IgG and 20% having IgA.
Sixteen percent of patients secrete light chains only.
Imaging

A skeletal survey to assess for lytic lesions should be performed. CT/MRI can
be considered in patients with bone pain not explained by skeletal survey to assess
for occult fracture.
Diagnostic Procedures

A bone marrow aspirate and biopsy should be done with immunophenotyping,
cytogenetics, and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), as certain translocations
have prognostic significance.
TREATMENT
The decision of when to treat typically depends on presence of symptoms from
the disease. A Cochrane review compared chemotherapy at the time of diagnosis to
chemotherapy at the time of disease progression and found that early treatment
effectively delayed progression of the disease; however, there were no significant
effects on mortality or on response rate to initial therapy.2 Patients with SMM may
remain stable for years before requiring therapy, and should be followed every 3
months to monitor for disease progression.
Initial therapy. Patients with symptomatic disease on presentation should
undergo treatment as survival without therapy is a median of 6 months.
The goalsof induction therapy include decreasing tumor burden and
symptoms, improving end-organ damage, and prolonging survival. The
preferred induction regimen has not been clearly defined, and the
upfront therapy of myeloma is rapidly evolving. 3,4 Melphalan and
prednisone (MP) is a well tolerated regimen with a response rate that
approaches 50%. However, in those who are expected to proceed to
224

stem cell transplantation (SCT), MP should be avoided because the
alkylating agent compromises stem cell reserve.
Thalidomide/dexamethasone (TD) was commonly used in the recent
past, but recent studies have demonstrated superiority of alternate
regimens. Lenalidomide/dexamethasone (LD) has shown superiority
over TD, with increased partial response rate (PR) of 80% versus 61%,
in addition to increasing time to progression (TTP), progression-free
survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS).5 The toxicity profile for
thalidomide includes venous thromboembolism (VTE) and peripheral
neuropathy, while that for lenalidomide includes myelotoxicity and VTE.
Bortezomib, a proteasome inhibitor, has high activity in MM, and, in
combination with dexamethasone, it has an overall response of 65% in
untreated patients.6 Toxicity profile for bortezomib includes peripheral
neuropathy. An older regimen consisting of vincristine, doxorubicin, and
dexamethasone (VAD) has comparable RR to newer therapy; however,
its use has fallen out of favor due to a cumbersome administration
schedule and requirement for central line. Combination therapies that
incorporate lenalidomide, bortezomib, steroids, and alkylators, as well as
various consolidation and maintenance approaches, are under active
investigation.
Hematopoetic stem cell transplant. Autologous SCT has been shown to
extend disease-free survival in patients with myeloma; although its role
may evolve given improvements in induction therapy. Currently, most
patients deemed suitable for autologous SCT proceed to harvesting of
stem cells after several cycles of induction therapy. Response rates to
SCT approach 90%, with one-third of patients experiencing a complete
response. The main deciding factors for who is eligible to undergo
autologous SCT include age, performance status, and presence of
comorbidities. Allogeneic transplants are also occasionally performed,
although they are generally reserved for young patients with a matched
sibling donor who have failed autologous SCT. Initial response to
induction therapy has not been shown to predict outcome after
autologous SCT. Maintenance therapy with lenalidomide or other active
agents may extend disease-free survival post-SCT.
Adjunctive therapy. Given advancements in overall survival of MM, the
role of adjunctive therapy is increasing. Bisphosphonates play a role in
decreasing skeletal events (i.e., fractures, lytic lesions, and osteoporosis)
225

and in decreasing bone pain due to lytic lesions. Radiation therapy is
effective in decreasing bony pain from distinct lesions and can be used
during complications such as spinal cord compression. Patients on
thalidomide or lenalidomide should be on prophylactic anticoagulation
because of increased risk of thrombotic events.
FOLLOW-UP
Follow-up of MM should be done by following the M-protein level and other
markers of disease progression including serum-free light chains, CBC, and serum
creatinine. Skeletal surveys are not used to follow disease response as lesions may
not show healing on x-rays.
PROGNOSIS

International Staging System (ISS). The ISS was developed in 2005 and is
based on a database of more than 10,000 patients. The staging system
also serves as an important prognostic tool. Median survivals are 62, 44,
and 29 months for stages I, II, and III, respectively.7
Stage I: β2-Microglobulin <3.5 mg/L and serum albumin ≥3.5 g/dL
Stage II: Neither stage I nor stage III
Stage III: β2-Microglobulin ≥ 5.5 mg/L
Durie–Salmon staging system. The older staging system is called the
Durie–Salmon criteria published in 1975, also consist of three stages.
This system was developed based on total tumor cell mass but has not
been shown to correlate with prognosis. A designation of A or B was
added to the clinical stage for patients with or without a serum
creatinine ≥2 mg/dL, respectively.
Stage I: All of the following: hemoglobin >10 g/dL, normal serum
calcium, normal skeletal survey or a solitary plasmacytoma, serum IgG
<5 g/dL and IgA <3 g/dL and urine light chain excretion <4 g/24 h.
Stage II: Neither stage I nor stage III.
Stage III: One or more: hemoglobin <8.5 g/dL, serum calcium >12
mg/dL, ≥3 lytic bone lesions, serum IgG >7 g/dL or IgA >5 g/dL, and
urine light chain excretion >12 g/24 h.
Cytogenetics. While utilization of this information has yet to lead to
226

alterations in clinical management, identification of certain cytogenetic
abnormalities can aid in prognostication.
Cytogenetics: Poor prognosis with deletion of chromosome 13 or
hypodiploidy.
FISH: Poor prognosis with t(4;14), t(14;16), 13q-, and 17p-.

SOLITARY PLASMACYTOMAS

GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Solitary plasmacytoma is a collection of monoclonal plasma cells localized in
tissue without evidence of a systemic plasma cell dyscrasia. There are two types of
solitary plasmacytomas; solitary plasmacytoma of bone (SBP) and solitary
extramedullary plasmacytoma (SEP). Plasmacytomas in the bone are more common
than in extra-medullary sites, with both constituting less than 10% of all plasma cell
dyscrasias.
Epidemiology

The incidence of solitary plasmacytoma occurs at an annual rate of
approximately 0.34 per 100,000 person-years in the United States. The average age
of diagnosis is 55 years, with incidence for both higher in males than in females.
DIAGNOSIS

Clinical Presentation

Solitary plasmacytomas of bone often present with bony pain, pathological
fracture, or cord compression. Bones undergoing increased hematopoiesis are more
commonlyinvolved in SBP, with the three most common involved sites including
vertebrae, pelvis, and upper extremities. While SEP has a predilection for the
aerodigestive tract, the most common location tends to be in the head and neck area.
Diagnostic Criteria

Diagnostic criteria for solitary plasmacytoma must encompass each of the
227

following:
presence of biopsy proven plasmacytoma showing a population of clonal
plasma cells;
absence of clonal plasma cell population on bone marrow biopsy and
aspiration;
absence of end-organ damage that can be attributed to an underlying
plasma cell disorder such as hypercalcemia; renal insufficiency; or
anemia; and
absence of other lytic lesions on skeletal survey or MRI of the
spine/pelvis.
Diagnostic Testing
Laboratories

Diagnostic testing for solitary plasmacytoma should contain tests to exclude
alternate diagnoses. Initial laboratory workup includes CBC, electrolytes, BUN,
creatinine, and calcium. An SPEP and UPEP with immunofixation should be
performed as up to 74% of cases may have presence of a small M protein. The
presence of M protein tends to be higher in patients with SBP as oppose to SEP.8
Serum free light chains as well as immunoglobulin levels should also be done.
Imaging

Askeletal survey should be done to exclude presence of multiple lytic lesions.
Also, MRI of the spine and pelvi s should be performed to exclude lesions that may
have been missed on x-ray.
Diagnostic Procedures

Biopsy of the suspected solitary lesion should be performed at the onset of
work up to establish the working diagnosis. To exclude a significant population of
clonal plasma cells in the bone marrow, a bone marrow biopsy and aspiration
should be performed.
TREATMENT
The mainstay of therapy for solitary plasmacytoma is localized radiation
therapy at a dose of 40 to 50 Gy over 20 to 25 treatments from which response
228

exceeds 90%.9 Surgery is an alternative if immediate tumor debulking is needed for
complications such as fracture or spinal cord compression; with adjuvant radiation
therapy considered. There is controversial data on the use of adjuvant chemotherapy,
mainly with melphalan and prednisone.
PROGNOSIS
More than 50% of patients with SBP will progress to MM, compared to fewer
than 30% with SEP, with median time to progression of 2 to 4 years. Recently, two
prognostic indicators have been identified to predict who will develop MM. A study
atMayo Clinic identified that patients with SBP who have an abnormal serum-free
light chain (FLC) ratio or presence of a urinary M protein at diagnosis have higher
risk of progression at 5 years (44% vs. 25%).10 Patients whose serum M protein is
still elevated 1 year after treatment also have an increased risk of progression.
Overall survival is higher in SEP than SBP (10 year survival 70% vs. 50%).

MONOCLONAL GAMMOPATHY OF UNDETERMINED
SIGNIFICANCE

GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) is a clinically
asymptomatic, premalignant condition characterized by the presence of a small neoplastic clonal population of plasma cells in the bone marrow. The pathophysiology
of the clonal population is the same as in MM; however, definitive criteria of MGUS
are the absence of end organ damage caused by the clonal population. It is estimated
that the prevalence of MGUS is approximately 3.2% in Caucasian patients over the
age of 50 and reaching 7.5% in those patients of age ≥85.11
DIAGNOSIS

Clinical Presentation

229

Patients with MGUS are clinically asymptomatic. It is typically diagnosed during
routine workup of elevated total serum protein or proteinuria.
Diagnostic Criteria

The International Myeloma Working Group developed diagnostic criteria for
MGUS in 2003. All three criteria must be met:
presence of a serum monoclonal protein (M protein) IgA, IgG, or IgM <3
g/dL;
presence of fever that 10% clonal bone marrow plasma cells; and
absence of end-organ damage attributed to the underlying plasma cell
disorder such as hypercalcemia; renal insufficiency; normochromic
normocytic anemia; or lytic bone lesions.
Diagnostic Testing
Laboratories

All patients should undergo similar testing as with a workup for MM. Initial
laboratory workup should include a CBC, serum electrolytes, BUN, serum
creatinine, and serum calcium. A serum and urine protein electrophoresis (SPEP)
with immunofixation, quantitative immunoglobulins, and measurement of serum free
light chains should be performed.
Imaging

A skeletal survey to assess for lytic lesions should be performed on all patients.
Diagnostic Procedures

A bone marrow aspirate and biopsy should be done with immunophenotyping,
cytogenetics, and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH).

230

TREATMENT
There is currently no treatment indicated for MGUS. As it is generally a
slowly progressing disorder, the majority of patients will not progress to a malignant
disease. Generally, it is accepted practice to follow these patients annually with
evaluation including SPEP, UPEP, CBC, and creatinine. If patients develop
symptoms concerning for progression to myeloma, they should undergo more
extensive evaluation.
PROGNOSIS
In general, the rate of progression for all patients diagnosed with MGUS is
approximately 1% per year. However, prognostic indicators have recently been
defined that indicate patients at higher risk of progression (Table 13-1).12

WALDENSTRÖM MACROGLOBULINEMIA

GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Waldenström macroglobulinemia (WM), also known as lymphoplasmacytic
231

lymphoma, is a rare malignant lymphoproliferative disorder characterized by the
production of an IgM paraprotein. It differs from IgM MM in that it is characterized
by the presence of excess lymphoplasmacytoid cells in the bone marrow.
Epidemiology

There are approximately 1500 new cases of WM annually in the United States.
The rate is higher in men than women, and higher in Caucasians than African
Amerians.
DIAGNOSIS

Clinical Presentation

Presentation of WM is generally vague and can be attributed to infiltration of
lymphocytes or plasmacytoid cells into tissue and organs, secondary to the
monoclonal IgM protein, or paraneoplastic neuropathy. Infiltration into organs can
lead tohepatosplenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, or dermatologic findings. At high
quantities, the IgM protein can lead to hyperviscosity of the blood causing signs of
stasis including stroke, transient ischemic attacks, and venous thromboembolism.
There is a correlation between hepatitis C and increased incidence of WM, and 10%
of patients with WM will have cryoglobulinemia.
Diagnostic Criteria

Two diagnostic criteria must be fulfilled to establish a diagnosis of WM:
IgM monoclonal protein of any value in the serum
≥10% lymphocytes with plasmacytoid differentiation in the bone marrow
in an intertrabecular pattern
Diagnostic Testing

Diagnostic testing should include SPEP and UPEP with immunofixation and
bone marrow biopsy with aspiration to establish the diagnosis. Ancillary testing
should include CBC, LDH, β2-microglobulin, and serum viscosity.
TREATMENT

232

Treatment of WM should only be initiated when symptoms develop or there is
evidence of significant end organ damage.13 Those without these findings are
termed to have smoldering WM. While there is no set standard of therapy, treatment
generally includes alkylating agents, nucleoside analogues, and rituximab. Patients
with symptoms of hyperviscosity should be treated with emergent plasmapheresis to
decrease the burden of the IgM monoclonal protein. In qualifying patients with
refractory or relapsed disease, high dose chemotherapy followed by autologous
HCT should be offered. No treatment has been shown to cure, with median survival
from time of diagnosi ~5 years.

AMYLOIDOSIS

GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Amyloidosis is characterized by the tissue deposition of amyloid fibrils in a
betapleated sheet configuration which is resistant to proteolysis.
Epidemiology

It is a rare disorder, affecting 5.1 to 12.8 per million people each year.
DIAGNOSIS

Clinical Presentation

Clinical presentation of amyloid is heterogeneous and depends on type of
amyloid. The majority of symptoms are defined by the predominant organ affected
and can include nephrotic syndrome, cardiomyopathy, neuropathy, hepatic
dysfunction, and bleeding diatheses. Specific physical exam findings may include
hepatomegaly, periorbital ecchymoses, macroglossia, and edema.
Diagnostic Criteria

Diagnostic criteria depend on the type of amyloid being diagnosed.
Primary amyloid (AL amyloid) is a plasma cell dyscrasia in which
233

monoclonal Ig light chain fragments lead to deposition of protein. As
such, a majority of patients will have a monoclonal light chain detected
in the serum or urine. It can occur alone or in conjunction with another
plasma cell dyscrasia.
Secondary amyloid (AA amyloid) occurs in conjunction with chronic
diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), in which the chronic
inflammatory state of the disease leads to deposition of acute phase
reactant serum amyloid A. Senile systemic amyloid has a predilection to
affect the heart and is due to deposition of transthyretin. Dialysis
associated amyloid occurs in patients on long term hemodialysis and is
the result of β2-microglobulin fibril deposition. There are numerous other
heritable forms of amyloidosis.
Diagnostic Testing

Regardless of the type of amyloid, tissue biopsy is required to establish
the diagnosis. In general, biopsy should be derived from the organ most
affected. However, if this is unattainable, abdominal fat pad aspiration is
recommended. Presence of amyloid is revealed with use of Congo red
staining which shows a characteristic apple green birefringent
appearance on polarized microscopy.
When AL amyloid is suspected in a patient without underlying known
plasma cell dyscrasias, SPEP and UPEP with immunofixation should be
performed. Bone marrow biopsy and aspiration can confirm presence of a
plasma cell dyscrasia. Serum-free light chains may also be useful in
diagnosis.
Ancillary testing as needed should be performed to determine the extent
of end organ damage.
TREATMENT
Treatment varies with the type of amyloid. If amyloid is felt to be secondary to a
plasma cell dyscrasia or another chronic medical condition, then treatment of the
underlying disorder is required. Treatment of a hereditary amyloidosis may require
organ transplantation in those who are candidates. Overall, prognosis in those with
amyloid is poor and novel treatments continue to be investigated.

GENERAL PRINCIPLES IN THE APPROACH TO A CANCER PATIENT
There have been enormous advances in our understanding of cancer biology over
the past few decades. The novel treatment approaches, including newer targeted
agents, immunotherapies, and advancement in supportive care strategies have given
rise to increasing optimism in the fight against cancer. Yet a new diagnosis of cancer
raises emotional and spiritual issues in a manner that few other diagnoses do, giving
the medical oncologist a unique role in caring for the patient. While caring for a
cancer patient, it is important to individualize management to his/her needs and
disease state. Listening and taking the time to explain terminology, prognosis, and
treatment options are key components in the relationship between the oncologist and
the patient. Given the oncologist’s knowledge of and experience with the behavior of
advanced malignancies, combined with the use of complex medical regimens often
lead to the oncologist serving as the primary care physician during active treatment.
Oncologists are central in providing palliative care for symptom relief as well as
assisting in the role of end-of-life discussions and care. A trusting relationship thus
builds between the patient and the treating physician. This chapter provides an
overview of this widely expanding field and provides a platform to understand the
basics oncology terminologies and approaches. The chapters following this will
provide further details in the management of specific cancers and associated clinical
conditions.
Definition

Cancer or malignant tumors is defined as an uncontrolled growth of cells with
potential for local invasion and distant metastases.

237

Classification

Classification of tumors in medical oncology is primarily based on site or
organ of origin of the malignancy. Tumors are further classified based on
the histopathologic characteristics of the tissue of origin. A pathologic
diagnosis is one of the most important steps in management of the
cancer, along with the identification of the primary site. Improvement in
immunohistochemical (IHC) staining techniques has aided in uniform
identification and classification of tumors in general. It is important to
remember that the individual characteristics and biology of the tumor,
their ability to invade and metastasize, and their response to various
therapies varies widely across the tumor types.
The two important terminologies used to refer tumor characteristics are
stage and grade.
Staging describes the extent of the disease in an individual patient.
Staging is used for most solid tumors, unlike hematological malignancies.
Staging is essential to the oncologist to plan optimal treatment
strategies and prognosis discussions. Stage is also the most important
predictor of survival. In research studies, staging is used for comparison
between cancer trials. The most commonly used staging systems are the
TNM classification system developed by the American Joint
Committee on Cancer (AJCC). “T” represents the primary tumor
characteristics. “N” represents the presence and extent of nodal sites of
the disease. “M” represents metastasis or distant sites of spread. It is
recommended that the reader consult an up-to-date staging manual
when evaluating a patient because of frequent revisions for each
individual malignancy. Clinical staging primarily uses radiographic data
to describe the extent of gross disease. Pathologic staging on the
other hand provides additional information gained by the pathologist
through microscopic examination of the tumor.
The grade of a tumor is a pathologic description of the cellular
characteristics of a given malignancy. It is a measure of the degree of
anaplasia or deviation of the growth and differentiation characteristics of
a cancer from the parental cell type. Thus a low-grade tumor retains
many of the characteristics of the originating cell type and they tend to
be associated with a less aggressive behavior and more favorable
prognosis. A high-grade tumor is characterized by loss of the
characteristics of the originating cell type as evidenced by a higher
238

mitotic activity. High grade tumors are often associated with a poorer
prognosis, given the more aggressive behavior of the cells.
Epidemiology

Cancer is the second leading cause of death in the United States after heart
disease. The lifetime risk of developing cancer in the United States is one in two for
men and one in three for women. In the United States, the surveillance, epidemiology
and end results (SEER) program has been collecting population based data including
cancer related data since 1975 and provides an important source of cancer trends in
the population.
Terminologies Used in Cancer Epidemiology and Statistics

It is important to make a distinction between cancer incidence and prevalence.
The cancer incidence rate is the number of newly diagnosed cancers
in a set population in a finite amount of time. It is usually expressed as
number of new cancer diagnoses per 100,000 people in 1 year.
Cancer prevalence is the number or percentage of people alive with a
cancer diagnosis on any given date. This includes new cases and existing
cases and is therefore a function of incidence and survival. Cancer
prevalence cannot differentiate persons with cured cancer from those
with active cancer.
Cancer mortality rate as expected is the number of cancer related
deaths, in a specified population over a defined period of time.
Survival is described in three broad terms: relative 5-year
survival, median survival, and overall survival. These statistics are
based on observational studies.
Relative 5-year survival rates compare the survival among cancer
patients with survival among the general population matched in age,
gender, and race, adjusted for comorbidities. This statistic method is
used in monitoring the progress of cancer detection and treatment in the
population.
Overall survival is the percentage of people in a study or treatment
group who are alive for a specific period of time, usually 5 years, after
being diagnosed with or treated for a cancer. This is also referred to as
the cancer survival rate.
The median survival is more indicative of prognosis and is the statistic
that is most commonly quoted to cancer patients. According to the
239

National Cancer Institute, median survival is the time from diagnosis or
treatment at which half of the patients with a given disease are found to
be alive. In a clinical trial, the median survival time is one way to
measure the effectiveness of a given treatment.
Progression-free survival is another terminology that is often used in
clinical studies, which refer to the duration of time during and after
treatment when the cancer has not worsened in a patient.
Epidemiologic Factors

The risk of developing cancer is affected by important demographic and
geographic factors in addition to other specific risk factors associated with
individual cancers.
Age is both an important epidemiologic factor and a risk factor.
The highest incidence of certain cancers varies with age, for example,
acute lymphoblastic lymphoma and neuroblastomas have their highest
incidence in young children, while testicular cancers and Hodgkin’s
lymphoma have their peak incidence in young adulthood. On the other
hand, the risk of common adult cancers increases with age, likely from
combination of accumulating effects of environmental carcinogens and
internal factors such as genetic mutations, hormonal influences and
immune system impairments.
Cancer affects both sexes with some cancers being gender specific.
While overall incidence of cancer is higher in men than women, the
gender distribution of individual cancers varies.
Race and ethnicity are other important epidemiologic factors that
influence both cancer incidence and death rates. Although it is not
completely understood at this time, it is possibly related to interaction of
the genetic and biologic characteristics of the individual patient with
environmental factors such as exposure to certain dietary products or
infectious agents.
Socioeconomic factors such as lack of education and unemployment
also plays a very intricate role with the above factor. Societies with lower
socioeconomic status are at a higher risk that is attributable to
inadequate use of screening tests, high-risk behavior such as alcohol use
and smoking, and delays in seeking medical attention.
Geographic location influences certain cancers primarily from the
environmental exposure to certain carcinogens and indirectly by the
240

socioeconomic status and racial and ethnic background of its population
composition.
Cancer Statistics

According to American Cancer Society, a total of 1,529,560 new cancer cases
and 569,490 deaths from cancer are projected to occur in the United States in 2010.
Overall cancer incidence rates decreased in the most recent period in both men
(1.3% per year from 2000 to 2006) and women (0.5% per year from 1998 to 2006).
There was also noted decrease in the death rates in both sexes. Among men, death
rates for all races combined decreased by 21% between 1990 and 2006. Among
women, the overall cancer death rates between 1991 and 2006 decreased by 12.3%.
The reduction in the overall cancer death rates translates to the avoidance of
approximately 767,000 deaths from cancer over the 16-year period. See Table 14-1
for the gender specific cancer incidence and mortality rates. 1

Pathophysiology

Few concepts in medicine are as complex as the pathophysiology of cancer.
Chapter 15 deals with the molecular basis of carcinogenesis.
Risk Factors

Certain risk factors have been associated with specific cancers, such as tobacco
use in lung and head and neck cancers, cytotoxic therapy with secondary
hematological malignancies, HPV infection and risk of cervical dysplasia and head
241

and neck cancers. There is however still several unknown risk factors that
contributes to the natural history of cancer. The individual risk factors for specific
cancers are elucidated in the remaining chapters.
DIAGNOSIS

Common Clinical Presentation
Lymphadenopathy

Lymphadenopathy may cause a patient to seek medical attention, may be found
incidentally on physical examination, or found by imaging. The differential diagnosis
is broad, including infectious etiologies, autoimmune diseases, sarcoidosis, drug
hypersensitivity, benign or clonal lymphoproliferative disorders, and malignancy.
Malignant causes of lymphadenopathy include lymphoma and metastatic solid
tumors. Features that suggest a malignant etiology of lymphadenopathy include lymph
nodes >2 cm in size, lymph nodes that are hard or fixed to adjacent structures, and
supraclavicular or epitrochlear lymphadenopathy. Lymphadenopathy may be
localized or generalized, and the differential diagnosis varies depending on the
location and distribution of the enlarged lymph nodes. When biopsy is indicated, an
open biopsy is preferred over a core biopsy or aspiration as it allows for evaluation
of the lymph node architecture, which is often necessary for classification of
lymphoma.2
Brain Mass

The differential diagnosis for a brain mass includes metastatic disease,
primary brain tumors, CNS lymphoma, hamartoma, AV malformation,
demyelination, cerebral infarction or bleeding, and infection.
Brain metastases are the most common intracranial tumors in adults,
accounting for 50% of all brain tumors. The presence of blood-brain
barrier prevents penetration of chemotherapeutic agents into the CNS,
thus providing a sanctuary site for metastatic tumor cells. The incidence
of brain metastases is increasing, perhaps due to the increasing
sensitivity of MRI. Lung, kidney, colorectal, and breast carcinomas and
melanoma frequently metastasize to the brain. Cancer of the prostate,
esophagus, oropharynx and nonmelanoma skin cancers rarely
metastasize to the brain.
242

Signs and symptoms of a brain mass include headache, focal neurological
deficits, altered mental status, seizures, and stroke.
The imaging study of choice is a contrast-enhanced MRI, which will
delineate the location, presence of other lesions, margins of the lesion,
and presence of vasogenic edema. Brain metastases are usually located
in the gray and white matter junction and have a large amount of
vasogenic edema.
A brain biopsy should be preformed whenever the diagnosis is in doubt.
This is particularly important in patients who have a single lesion or have
a cancer that rarely metastasizes to the brain. Often, a brain lesion is the
primary presentation of a malignancy. Evaluation for a source of a
metastatic focus, particularly lung and breast cancer, should precede
biopsy.
Basic initial workup includes staging CT of the chest, abdomen and
pelvis, colonoscopy, comprehensive skin exam, and mammogram.
Liver Metastases

The differential diagnosis of a focal liver lesion includes primary
malignant liver tumors (such as hepatocellular carcinoma,
cholangiocarcinoma, lymphoma, and sarcoma), metastatic liver lesions,
benign hepatic cysts, cavernous hemangioma, hepatic adenoma, and
abscesses.
Before proceeding to diagnostic testing, it is important to assess the
clinical scenario. For example, is this an incidental finding? Does the
patient have any risk factors such as hepatitis C/cirrhosis, oral
contraceptive use, travel history, history of malignancy, or constitutional
symptoms?
Diagnostic modalities include liver ultrasound, triphasic CT of the liver,
and MRI of the liver. If there is a likelihood of malignancy, a fine-needle
biopsy can be done. It is important to note that if a patient has a remote
history of cancer, one cannot assume that a new liver lesion is due to
metastases. A new liver lesion has to be definitively diagnosed, as a
second unrelated malignancy cannot be ruled out.
Bone Lesions

Bone lesions can be the initial presentation of metastatic cancer or can
present later in advanced malignancy. Bone metastases are commonly
243

due to multiple myeloma, breast cancer, or prostate cancer, but almost
any solid malignancy can metastasize to the bone. They are classified as
osteolytic or osteoblastic lesions. Osteolytic lesions refer to the
destruction of normal bone, whereas osteoblastic lesions are the result
of deposition of new bone. Multiple myeloma lesions are purely
osteolytic. Metastases from prostate cancer are usually osteoblastic.
Breast cancer metastases are usually a combination of both. Bone is a
preferential site for metastasis because tumor cells express and produce
various chemokines and adhesive molecules that bind corresponding
molecules on the stromal cells of the bone. For example, expression of
RANKL (receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand) in bone
facilitates development of metastasis by binding RANK (receptor
activator of nuclear factor kappa B) on the surface of tumor cells. Also,
tumor cells can express bone sialoprotein and bind collagen type I in the
extracellular matrix in the bone, thus becoming more adhesive.
Signs and symptoms of bone involvement include focal pain, pathologic
fractures, hypercalcemia, and cord compression.
Diagnosis is usually made by radiological testing, including plain films,
which diagnose osteolytic lesions, and bone scans, which detect
osteoblastic lesions only.
Treatment includes systemic chemotherapy and hormone therapy. Local
radiation can be used to palliate symptoms and prevent pathological
fractures. Bisphosphonates are used to treat hypercalcemia, treat bone
pain, prevent fractures, and prevent further destruction of the normal
bone.
History

The importance of a thorough history taking cannot be stressed enough. The
duration of symptoms can provide some insight into the aggressiveness of the
malignancy. The associated symptom complex can provide information on the extent
of the disease, especially organ specific symptoms which can point toward
metastatic involvement by the disease. For example, new onset neurologic symptoms
in a lung cancer patient should prompt imaging of the head. In a patient with
metastatic disease, it may be important to first address the most bothersome
symptom(s) for the purpose of palliation before starting definitive treatment for the
cancer. Assessment of nutritional status and weight changes is an integral part of
cancer management. Performance scales as mentioned below are used to assess the
functional status of the patient either before starting treatment or during ongoing
244

treatment. While evaluating a patient on active treatment, it is important for the
treating physician to first familiarize with the most common side effects of that
treatment in order to dose adjust or change treatment if necessary.
Evaluation of Performance Status

Performance status describes the functional abilities of the oncology patient. It is
frequently used to provide a standardized assessment of patients considered for
inclusion in protocols or to characterize patients at diagnosis or during treatment or
follow-up. The initial performance status score predicts survival. The Karnofsky
Performance Status and the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG)
performance status scale (Table 14-2) are two of the most frequently used scales.
Physical Examination

A complete physical examination is warranted in any newly diagnosed cancer
patient with particular attention to the organ involved. In metastatic cancers where
the primary site is not yet identified, a physical examination may provide the first
clue as to the diagnosis. This should include a breast and pelvic examination in
women, a genital examination in men, and rectal examination in both men and
women. In other instances, a good physical examination may provide clue as to the
extent of the primary malignancy. They may also point toward metastatic spread of
tumors, for example enlargement of the liver in a patient with colon cancer or bone
tenderness in a breast cancer patient. A good physical examination can also aid in
following response to treatment, such as the decreasing size of the breast mass or
lymph nodes.

Diagnostic Testing
Pathology Diagnosis

The treatment of a malignancy requires a diagnosis based on tissue pathology.
In only rare emergent situations is treatment started without a diagnosis. Consultation
from the surgical, medical, and radiation oncology team members is essential. These
oncology professionals are crucial to include in cases in which prompt therapy
should be delivered to the patient to reduce the risk of morbidity or mortality in
certain oncologic emergencies.
Light microscopy is central to diagnosis. It delineates the microscopic
structure of the malignancy, such as nuclear-to-cytoplasm ratio in
leukemia, invasion into the microvasculature, or extent of glandular
crowding in adenocarcinoma. Additional studies, including
immunohistochemical staining, flow cytometry, cytogenetics, and
molecular studies for gene rearrangements can corroborate a suspected
diagnosis and assist in further subclassification.
246

Immunohistochemical staining identifies specific proteins in the
tissue based on the principle of antigen-antibody complex. The
development of fluorescent and nonfluorescent chromogens along with
various amplification techniques has increased the sensitivity and
specificity of this procedure. This technique is widely used in surgical
pathology for typing tumors based on the principle of differential
expression of proteins in different biologic tissues. They help provide
such fundamental information as: is this a tumor? Is it benign or
malignant? What type of tumor is it? They also provide information on
the tissue of origin of the tumor. For example, cytokeratin stains are
used to identify carcinomas from sarcomas, CD20 for B-cell lymphoma,
etc. Others provide prognostic information such as Ki67, which is a
marker of proliferation.
Flow cytometry characterizes and sorts individual cells suspended in
liquid as they flow in a narrow stream that pass through a beam of laser
light. It is most frequently applied in hematologic malignancies where
certain antigen profiles are diagnostic (e.g., CD5/CD23 coexpression in
chronic lymphocytic leukemia). In cytogenetic testing, chromosomes
from blood, bone marrow, or solid tissue can be isolated to identify
deletions, translocations, trisomies, or insertions into the genome. In this
process, chromosomes of 20 cells are counted in metaphase. The bands
within the chromosomes are studied to identify any of the
aforementioned abnormalities. Cytogenetic testing has been taken one
step further with the advent of FISH (fluorescence in situ hybridization).
The cellular DNA from the biopsy specimen prepared on glass and mixed
with a known DNA probes that are fluorescently labeled, such as 9;22
rearrangement for chronic myeloid leukemia. If the DNA contains that
translocation, the probe light up under fluorescent microscopy will align
differently than if the translocation is not present. The advantage of this
test is that it can identify subtle changes in the chromosome. However, it
can only identify one abnormality at a time (unlike cytogenetic testing)
so the investigator must know which abnormality to look for.
Laboratory Testing

Routine evaluation with complete blood counts and a comprehensive metabolic
panel is important for baseline information about organ function. Any abnormal
laboratory data may provide additional information on organ infiltration by the
247

tumor, for example, an elevated alkaline phosphatase may provide indication on
bony metastasis, transaminitis may be indicative of liver involvement, and low
blood counts may point toward bone marrow infiltration. Tumor markers may
provide additional information in some cases. Tumor markers are useful in
diagnostic workup of certain germ cell tumors, such as testicular and
neuroendocrine tumors. The majority of tumor markers, however, lack sensitivity
and specificity for cancer diagnosis. Some tests may provide prognostic
information as they reflect tumor burden, such as an LDH in lymphoma, and LDH,
HCG, and AFP in testicular germ cell tumors. Most tumor markers are used in
clinical practice for the purpose of monitoring treatment response and progression
of cancer. The only tumor marker that is part of screening in the United States is
prostate-specific antigen (PSA) for prostate cancer, which is now controversial.
Imaging Modalities3

CT (computed tomography) allows cross-sectional imaging of the
patient. Additional applications of CT include three-dimensional
reconstructions and CT angiography. Intravenous radiocontrast medium
is frequently utilized to enhance the sensitivity of the imaging. Risks of
radiocontrast media include allergic reaction and nephrotoxicity.
MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) is widely used in imaging the brain
for either primary CNS tumors or metastases. MRI also has an emerging
role in evaluation of breast cancer with breast MRI. MRI of the liver has a
role in hepatocellular carcinoma as well as evaluation of solitary liver
metastases in colon cancer. Absolute contraindications to MRI scanning
include pacemakers, aneurysm clips, certain metallic cardiac prosthetic
valves, and intraocular metal fragments.
PET (positron emission tomography) is a functional imaging modality
that images the distribution of intravenously administered radiolabeled
tracers. 18-Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) is the most widely utilized
metabolic tracer. PET is most sensitive in aggressive and metabolically
active tumors such as melanoma, head and neck, breast, lung,
esophageal, cervical, and colorectal cancer, as well as aggressive
subtypes of lymphoma. FDG-PET has a lower sensitivity in slowergrowing tumors such as low-grade lymphomas, neuroendocrine tumors,
and bronchioalveolar cell lung carcinoma. PET scans can be performed
with concurrent CT (PET-CT) to merge both functional and anatomic
imaging.
248

Radionuclide bone scans are frequently used to detect bone
metastases. They are less sensitive to purely osteolytic lesions, such as
in multiple myeloma.
Skeletal survey includes plain x-rays of the skull, spine, pelvis, and
extremities. It is utilized in multiple myeloma to survey for osteolytic
bone lesions.
Utilization of other forms of medical imaging including volumetric (3D)
anatomical imaging, dynamic contrast imaging and functional (molecular) imaging
are in the process of being tested and validated in clinical trials. If successful, the
use of medical imaging may serve as surrogate endpoint in clinical trials and aid
clinicians in making earlier treatment decisions.
Diagnostic Procedures

An array of diagnostic procedures is available to establish a cancer diagnosis in
a given patient. This may range from simple blood tests or bone marrow biopsies
obtained by the treating physician in hematological malignancies to a multispecialty
approach. Tissue for pathologic evaluation can be obtained by surgical approaches,
such as lymph node biopsy or surgical resection specimen. Image guided such as CT
or USG guided biopsy of target lesion is gaining popularity, as they are less
invasive. Evaluations of luminal tumors are aided by the use of various endoscopic
procedures. Some clinical situations may, however, pose special clinical challenges
requiring more than one attempt and involvement of more than one specialty. Other
diagnostic procedures such as lumbar puncture, pleural fluid thoracentesis or ascitic
fluid paracentesis are done as part of diagnostic workup or for palliation of
symptoms. Other sophisticated techniques such as chemo-embolization are discussed
in relevant chapters.
TREATMENT

Approach to Oncology Treatment

The majority of adult solid malignancies are best managed through a
multidisciplinary approach involving surgeons, radiation oncologists, and medical
oncologists. There are often multiple different treatment options, and patients should
be an active part of the decision-making process. An important element in the
treatment of cancer patients is to define the goals of treatment, addressing the
possibilities of cure, prolongation of survival, or improvement in quality of life in
249

individual cases. Treatment recommendations should be carefully tailored to the
individual patient, taking into account comorbid conditions, performance status, and
other psychosocial issues.
Principles of Surgical Approach in Cancer

Surgery still remains the most effective modality for curing cancer confined to a
local site. In many instances, the surgical removal of the primary cancer also
involves the removal of a regional lymph node area. Appropriate patients can be
identified for definitive or curative surgery. The goal is for the surgeon to remove
all neoplastic cells, including the resection of a complete margin of normal tissue
around the primary tumor. Depending on the primary tumor, patients with a solitary
or limited number of metastases to sites such as the brain, liver, and lung can be
cured by the surgical resection of the metastatic disease. Cytoreductive surgery or
tumor debulking can facilitate subsequent radiation and/or chemotherapy in some
malignancies such as ovarian cancer. Surgery may also be necessary in the palliative
setting to relieve symptoms, such as intestinal obstruction from colon cancer.
Principles of Radiation Therapy

Radiation therapy is the treatment of choice for some cancers. The use of this
treatment modality is based on the responsiveness of the cancer to ionizing radiation.
Some cancers are extremely sensitive, including lymphomas and seminomas,
whereas others are relatively resistant. Radiation therapy can be the sole curative
local modality in malignancies such as cervical cancer and prostate cancer. It is also
useful in the adjuvant setting to increase the likelihood of local or regional control
after surgery. Radiation therapy also plays a key role in the palliation of symptoms
from primary or metastatic tumor masses, including spinal cord compression and
bone metastases. Further details of the principles and uses of radiation therapy are
elucidated in Chapter 17. See Table 14-3 for list of radiosensitive tumors.
Principles of Systemic Therapy

In contrast to surgery or radiation therapy, which has only local effects on the
tumor, the role of systemic therapy is geared at treating both the local tumor and
potential or actual areas of metastatic disease throughout the body. Systemic therapy
for treatment of cancers refers to traditional cytotoxic chemotherapy, immunotherapy
and newer targeted therapy. The uses of different systemic therapy in various
cancers and the side effects are discussed in subsequent chapters. Clinical trials are
important tools in medical oncology to test novel treatment approaches in the
250

management of cancer. Important clinical trials in the past decade have paved the
way for more effective and less toxic regimens. Trials have also added multiple new
agents and important biologic information in the fight against cancer. It is important
to screen the individual patient for eligibility for the clinical trials available at your
institution.

Chemotherapy

Before the initiation of chemotherapy, the goal of treatment must be clearly
defined and discussed with the patient. Not all patients are candidates for
chemotherapy. Potential risks and benefits must be considered when deciding to treat
251

a patient with cytotoxic agents. The performance status and overall nutritional state
of the cancer patient is extremely important when making the decision to use
chemotherapy. Patients with performance status scores of 3 to 4 on the ECOG scale
are usually not candidates for systemic therapy unless they have previously untreated
tumors known to be especially responsive to chemotherapy. See Table 14-4 for list
of chemosensitive tumors.
Immunotherapy

Immunotherapy refers to the use of pharmacologic agents that are intrinsic to the
immune system. High concentrations of these biologic response modifiers stimulate
the immune system to kill cancer cells. Examples include interferon-alpha,
interleukin-2, and monoclonal antibodies. Toxicities can range from fevers and
flulike symptoms to anaphylaxis and adult respiratory distress syndrome–like
manifestations. Development of tumor vaccines and other potent immunotherapies
are gaining momentum with increasing understanding of cancer immunology.
Targeted Therapies

These therapies interfere with specific pathways needed for the growth and
survival of cancer cells. These therapies may include monoclonal antibodies or
small molecule inhibitors, which target specific receptors or kinases such as the
epidermal growth factors receptor, the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor,
and the Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase. The past decade has seen the approval of several
targeted agents in the treatment of various cancers either as single agent or in
combination with chemotherapy. Endocrine therapies used in the treatment of
prostate and breast cancer are among the oldest form of targeted agents. They are
very effective treatment strategies in these hormone sensitive cancers and used
widely in multiple clinical settings.
Systemic chemotherapy has been used in various clinical settings.
Adjuvant therapy refers to the use of systemic therapy following
complete surgical resection to improve both disease-free and overall
survival. The goal is to eliminate undetected local and
micrometastatic foci of tumor. There is no way to measure or follow
response to therapy, and thus duration of treatment is determined
empirically by clinical trials. Cancers for which adjuvant chemotherapy
has proved to benefit survival include colorectal, breast, lung, ovarian
cancers, rhabdomyosarcoma, Ewing’s sarcoma, and osteosarcoma.
Similarly, adjuvant hormonal therapy is effective in improving survival in
breast cancer patients who are estrogen receptor positive.
252

Neoadjuvant therapy refers to systemic therapy that is administered
before surgery. The goal of neoadjuvant therapy is to decrease the
tumor burden for the definitive surgical procedure, thus minimizing
complications and making organ preservation more feasible. In
addition, the clinician can monitor the tumor responsiveness to the
systemic agent and able to deliver systemic treatment without delay to
eliminate micrometastatic disease. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy is used in
breast, esophageal, rectal, lung, and bladder cancers, as well some
sarcomas.
Combined modality therapy refers to the combination of
chemotherapy and radiotherapy used to treat bulky disease, especially
when curative resection is not possible or less effective or when organ
preservation is considered. For example, combination therapy can be
curative and organ preserving in certain tumors such as laryngeal and
anal cancers. Combined modality therapy improves survival for some
patients with locally advanced lung, esophageal, head and neck,
pancreatic, and cervical cancers. The combined modality therapy can
also be used to decrease the size of the tumor for either a curative or a
salvage surgical procedure later.
Palliative chemotherapy is typically administered in metastatic setting
or advanced stage of malignancy. This treatment modality is not
intended for cure, but for slowing progression of disease and
prolongs life. The chemotherapy agents are either administered as
combination or single agents sequentially in this setting.
Induction chemotherapy is used as the initial treatment of a
malignancy to achieve complete remission or significant cytoreduction. It
is commonly used in the treatment of acute leukemia and lymphoma.
Consolidation chemotherapy is given after a patient is in remission to
prolong the duration of remission and overall survival in patients with
acute leukemia. Maintenance chemotherapy is the use of prolonged,
low-dose chemotherapy to prolong the duration of remission and achieve
a cure in those patients; it is currently only utilized in certain leukemias.
Salvage chemotherapy is given with the intent to control disease or
palliate symptoms after the failure of initial treatments.
High-dose chemotherapy is typically used in the treatment of
hematologic malignancies. High doses of chemotherapy are used to
ablate the bone marrow requiring rescue with allogeneic or
253

autologous bone marrow or stem cell replacement to repopulate the
marrow. Allogeneic transplants have been curative in selected patients
with chronic myelogenous leukemia and acute leukemias. Autologous
stem cell transplants have been most successful for aggressive
lymphomas and multiple myeloma. The use of bone marrow transplant
in solid organ malignancies remains controversial.
MONITORING/FOLLOW-UP

Response to Therapy

In general, responses to therapy are measured by objective changes in tumor size
and increases in disease-free and overall survival. The RECIST (response criteria
in solid tumors) is a widely utilized tool for describing changes in solid tumor size
in response to therapy. RECIST criteria are a voluntary, international standard that is
not an NCI standard. They are based on a simplification of former methods (WHO,
ECOG) and based on measurable disease.4 Other response criteria are utilized in
hematologic malignancies. The single most important indicator of the effectiveness
of chemotherapy is the complete response rate. No patient with advanced cancer can
be cured without attaining a complete remission. There are frequent changes in the
definitions of response criteria assessment. The reader is advised to look for
updated guidelines in this regard. The present information is currently available and
defined on the NCI website.5
Complete response is defined as the disappearance of all target
lesions on imaging studies of at least one month of duration.
Partial response is when there is at least a 30% reduction in the sum
of the longest diameter of a target lesion when compared to the baseline
study.
Progressive disease is when there is at least a 20% increase in the
sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, appearance of new
lesions, or the death of the patient as a result of the tumor.
Chemotherapy is discontinued in the setting of progression, and the
patient is reevaluated.
The term stable disease is used when the measurable disease does not
meet the criteria for complete response, partial response, or progression.
Stable disease represents a difficult challenge to oncologists. If therapy
254

is tolerated with no significant side effects, it is often continued, provided
it is recognized that progressive disease will eventually occur.
OUTCOME/PROGNOSIS

Goals of Care

When a patient is diagnosed with cancer, one of the first questions an oncologist
will be asked is: “How long do I have?” It is not the oncologist’s place to assign a
life expectancy to any one patient. Each clinical scenario is different; to speculate on
life expectancy can have serious emotional ramifications. An individual’s prognosis
is based on staging, comorbidities, performance status, and response to treatment.
Although it is possible to predict curability or median survival, long-term follow-up
is essential to get a more accurate sense of prognosis for any given patient. Even
when the overall prognosis is poor, an honest and compassionate discussion with the
patient and family members is essential. The role of the medical oncologist is to
provide upfront and honest answers to even the most difficult questions and to allow
the patient and family to set realistic goals that will help guide future health care
decisions.
Palliative Care

Palliative care of cancer patients entails the management of all of the symptoms
related to the cancer itself and the toxicities of treatment. It also includes the
multidisciplinary care of psychosocial issues, with the primary goal of optimizing
the quality of life and minimizing the morbidity and symptoms related to cancer and
its treatments. Prolongation of survival is a secondary goal, which may or may not
be achieved, but cure is not the primary intent in palliative care. Chemotherapy,
hormonal therapy, radiation, and surgery are still useful in palliation. Patient
selection for interventions is crucial. For patients with advanced cancer and poor
performance status, aggressive treatment may be detrimental rather than beneficial.
Hospice

Hospice is a philosophy of care based on a coordinated program of support
services for terminally ill patients and their families. Palliative care is provided
with the aim to improve quality of life and allow a comfortable death. Any patient
with a limited life expectancy (≤6 months) may be eligible for hospice care. The
255

interdisciplinary hospice team consists of nurses trained in pain and symptom
management, physicians, home health aides, social workers, chaplains, and
volunteers. Care is generally given in the home but may be imparted in nursing
homes or hospitals if necessary. Medicare hospice benefits also include complete
coverage for all medications pertaining to the hospice diagnosis, durable medical
equipment, and oxygen. Most hospice agencies provide 24-hour on-call service,
brief respite care, and bereavement counseling for up to one year after the patient
dies.

INTRODUCTION
Since the discovery of oncogenes in the 1970s, our understanding of cancer
biology has expanded exponentially. Cancer is a product that evolves from
cumulative genetic or epigenetic changes that progressively drive the transformation
of normal cells into malignant derivatives.1 These changes result in alterations of
various signaling pathways that are now being intensively studied and increasingly
used in aiding diagnosis and guiding cancer therapy. Our current understanding of
cancer biology is too broad to be review comprehensively here. In this chapter, we
try to highlight the general mechanisms of tumorigenesis and metastasis.
HALLMARKS OF CANCER
Proliferation of normal cells is constantly held in check and intricately regulated
both by the cellular intrinsic signaling mechanisms and the extrinsic
microenvironment. In contrast, failure of these regulatory mechanisms is the general
basis for uncontrolled cellular proliferation and tumorigenesis. Cancer cells acquire
several intrinsic pathologic traits that not only liberate them from the homeostatic
signaling from neighboring cells, but that endow them with the ability to subvert the
surrounding tissues into supporting their proliferation. It is now widely accepted that
several hallmarks, each originating from aberrations of distinct signaling pathways,
are acquired during tumorigenesis. 2,3 Theseare:
Self-sufficiency in growth signals. Tumor cells can generate their
own growth factors, stimulate the release of growth factors bound to the
extracellular matrix, enhance their sensitivity to growth signals by
overexpression of receptors, or proliferate independently of growth
257

signals by constitutive activation of signaling pathways.
Insensitivity to antigrowth signals. Aberrant cell proliferation is
normally constrained by growth inhibitors such as transforming growth
factor beta (TGFβ)that is secreted by other cells in the
microenvironment. These factors help maintain cells in the quiescent
phase (G0) or inhibit uncontrolled progression from the G1 to S phase.
Tumor cells can evade TGFβ inhibition by downregulating TGFβ
receptors, displaying mutant receptors, or inactivating downstream
signaling proteins.
Evasion of apoptosis. Signals evoked by oncogenes, DNA damage,
detachment from basement membrane or hypoxic tumor environment
often triggers apoptosis, a form of programmed cell death that involves
p53 and the Bcl-2 family proteins such as Bad and Bax. Such control
mechanisms are usually impaired in cancer cells by loss of p53 or
overexpression of antiapoptotic proteins such as Bcl-2.
Limitless replication potential. Telomere is a structure consisting of
highly repetitive DNA sequence and specialized proteins at the ends of
chromosomes that protects the chromosomes from degradation. During
each cycle of DNA replication, a small section of telomere is normally
lost. When the length of the telomere reaches a critically low threshold,
cells undergo senescence or apoptosis. On the other hand, cancer cells
acquire the ability to maintain telomere length, either by reactivation of
telomerase, an enzyme that elongates telomere or by another
mechanism called ALT (alternative-lengthening of telomeres). This
allows cancer cells to replicate indefinitely.
Angiogenesis. Tumors cannot grow larger than 0.2 mm in diameter,
the diffusion limit of oxygen, without access to blood vessels. Tumor
cells are capable of inducing formation of new blood vessels, termed
angiogenesis to support their growth. Angiogenesis is often induced by
hypoxia and requires upregulation of proangiogenic factors, such as
vascular-endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and fibroblast growth factor
(FGF)-1 and -2, with simultaneous inhibition of antiangiogenic factors
such as angiopoietin-1 and thrombospondin-1. Targeting angiogenesis by
anti-VEGF agents, such as bevacizumab, is now a common strategy in
cancer treatment. 4
Tissue invasion and metastasis. A defining feature of malignant as
opposed to benign tumor is the ability to invade its surrounding tissue
258

and metastasize. Cancer cells acquire the ability to disrupt the basement
membrane by upregulating matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) and invade
after undergoing epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT). An extremely
few number of cancer cells which acquire the ability to intravasate,
survive in bloodstream/lymphatic system, evade immune destruction and
extravasate into distal organs will subsequently form metastatic clones.
Evasion of the immune system. In order to survive, cancer cells must
escape the immune response, particularly cytotoxic T lymphocytes and
natural killer cells, by either preventing immune recognition or inducing
immune tolerance. Escape from immune recognition is mediated by
downregulating mechanisms necessary for antigen presentation.
Examples include downregulation of MHC molecules and inhibition of
costimulatory molecules on tumor cells. Generation of immune tolerance
involves altering the complex cellular and cytokine network of antigen
presentation. Examples include production of inhibitory cytokines,
suppression of stimulatory cytokines, and induction of formation of Tregulatory cells.
Reprogramming of metabolism. Unlike normal cells in which energy
is generated mainly from oxidative phosphorylation in the mitochondria,
cancer cells are often reprogrammed to derive their energy from
glycolysis in the cytoplasm (Warburg effect). Such transformation not
only helps the cancer cells to adapt to the hypoxic microenvironment,
but also provides the essential substrates for synthesis of
macromolecules such as amino acids and nucleosides required for rapid
proliferation. 5 Such reprogramming is usually driven by oncoproteins
such as AKT1, mTOR, and myc. Clinically, the high dependence of cancer
cells on glucose metabolism provides the basis for [18F]
fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG–PET) imaging, a
powerful tool to detect andmonitortumorigenicgrowth.
ROOT CAUSE
ALTERATIONS

OF

CANCER:

GENETIC

AND

EPIGENETIC

Mechanisms underlying the above-mentioned phenotypes typically originate from
sequential gain or loss of gene functions that can occur within the gene (genetic
alterations) or the regulatory process that control gene expression (epigenetic
alterations).6
259

Etiologies of Genetic Alterations Include the Following

Inherited defects. Germline mutation in certain genes can predispose
one to developing cancer over time, and is the cause of most familial
cancer syndromes.
Exogenous damage. Chemicals, especially aromatic hydrocarbons,
heavy metals, and substances such as asbestos fibers can damage the
DNA are all potential carcinogens. UVA induces production of reactive
oxygen species (ROS), while UVB causes cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers
and pyrimidine pyrimidone photoproducts. Platinum and alkylating
chemotherapeutic agents are known to cause DNA crosslinks.
Oncogenic viruses. Cells infected with certain DNA viruses and
retroviruses can ultimately become tumorigenic. This can be caused by
aberrant expression of oncogenes (transduction) or through enhanced
expression of cellular protooncogenes (proviral insertion). Examples
include HPV in cervical cancer, EBV in Burkitt’s lymphoma and
nasopharyngeal carcinoma, HBV and HCV in hepatocellular carcinoma,
and HTLV-1 and -2 in T-cell leukemia.
Genomic instability. DNA replication is not 100% fail-safe. Replication
errors such as point mutation, chromosomal translocation, amplification
or rearrangement can occur and are normally rectified through specified
DNA repair mechanisms. If the error cannot be repaired, DNA damage
response is triggered and cells are programmed to undergo apoptosis.
However, certain errors such as point mutations, small
insertions/deletions or reciprocal translocation can sometimes escape
DNA repair mechanisms and be passed onto daughter cells. Importantly,
cells with defects, either inherited or acquired, in DNA repair mechanism
(such as BRCA1/2 mutation) or DNA damage response (such as ataxiatelangiectasia, germline p53 mutation or inhibition by viral proteins such
as HPV E6 and E7) are much more likely to accumulate and propagate
replication errors. The result is genomic instability and increased chance
of cancer formation.
Epigenetic Changes

Other than changes in primary nucleotide sequence, gene expression is also
regulated by epigenetic mechanisms such as methylation/demethylation of gene
promoters/enhancers and histone modifications.7 In the last decade, control of gene
260

expression at posttranscriptional level by micro-RNAs was discovered and will
also be discussed in this section.
DNA Methylation

Methylation of cytosines in CpG dinucleotides by DNA methyltransferases
generally leads to transcriptional silencing. Repetitive CpG dinucleotides (or CpG
islands) are often found within the upstream promoters of most genes. When
methylated, these regions become inaccessible to transcription factors and can
attract histone modifying proteins that lead to formation of compact, inactive
chromatin. DNA methylation is essential in normal developmental processes such as
genomic imprinting and cellular differentiation. However, when the promoter of a
tumor suppressor gene is hyper-methylated, transcription is shut down and cells are
propelled toward malignant transformation. For example, hypermethylation of the
promoter for MLH1, a gene involved in DNA mismatch repair, has been implicated
in the pathogenesis of hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer. Two DNA
methyltransferase inhibitors, 5-azacytadine and decitabine (2′-deoxy-5-azacytidine),
are approved therapy for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndrome and also have
activity in acute myeloid leukemia.
Histone Deacetylation

Acetylation/deacetylation of lysine residues on histones by histone
acetyltransferases (HATs) and histone deacetylases (HDACs), respectively, is
another mode of epigenetic modification which can alter gene expression.
Deacetylation causes histones to wrap more tightly around DNA, which blocks
access of transcription factors to DNA. In cancer, tumor suppressor genes that are
silenced by histone deacetylation can theoretically be reactivated by HDAC
inhibitors. Currently, HDAC inhibitors such as Vorinostat and Romidepsin are
approved for treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma.
Posttranscriptional Regulation: Micro-RNAs

Micro-RNAs, an important discovery of the last decade, are a species of short,
single-stranded, noncoding RNAs that can bind to the complementary sequences
within target mRNAs and generally lead to their degradation. More than half of
human genes are now believed to be regulated by micro-RNAs. Aberrant expression
of micro-RNAs is found in many human cancers. 8 For example, miR-15a and miR16–1, which negatively regulate Bcl-2, an antiapoptotic gene, are often deleted or
down-regulated in B-cell CLL. On the other hand, miR-9, which is overexpressed in
breast cancer, promotes metastasis by downregulating E-cadherin. Therapies
261

targeting micro-RNAs are still under investigation.
Outcome of Genetic/Epigenetic Alterations: Oncogenes and Tumor Suppressor Genes

The two major classes of genes are that are subject to these changes are the
oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes. In principle, tumorigenic changes involve
gain of oncogene function and loss of tumor suppressor function.
Oncogenes are altered versions of normal genes (termed protooncogenes) that have acquired gain-of-function point mutations, gene
copy amplifications or translocations. The results are cellular
proliferation, growth, survival, invasion, and angiogenesis. Several
categories of oncogenes have been described and these include:
1. Growth factors: sis, trk
2. Growth-factor receptors: EGFR, HER2/neu, c-kit, PDGFR, VEGFR
3. Tyrosine kinases: bcr-abl, src, Syk-ZAP-70, BTK
4. Serine-threonine kinases: Raf, Akt, MAPK, cyclin-dependent kinases,
Aurora kinases
5. GTPases: K-Ras, N-Ras, H-Ras, Cdc42, Rac, Ral
6. Cytoplasmic proteins: Bcl-2, survivin
7. Transcription factors: c-myc, jun, fos, Nf-kB
Tumor suppressor genes or gate-keeper genes function to restrain
cellular proliferation and/or maintain cellular homeostasis. Classic
examples include PTEN, NF1, NF2, and APC which are negative
regulators of proliferation; INK4a-ARF which controls cell cycle, p53
which is the master switch of apoptosis, BRCA1/ BRCA2 which are key
players in DNA damage response and VHJ which negatively regulates
angiogenesis. In cancer cells, expression of tumor suppressor genes is
usually lost by biallelic gene deletion, loss-of-function mutations or
transcriptionally silenced by epigenetic mechanisms. While loss of tumor
suppressor genes alone is not sufficient for malignant transformation, it
does predispose cells to accumulate further genetic changes and
cooperates with oncogenes to complete cellular transformation.
Clinically, germline mutations/deletions of tumor suppressor genes are
associated with several familial cancer syndromes (See Table15-1).

262

p53 mutations.
The tumor suppressor p53 is the most frequently mutated gene in human cancer
and therefore warrants further discussion. p53 is normally activated in response to
stresses such as DNA damage, hypoxia, and oncogene activation. It encodes a
transcription factor that primarily activates genes responsible for cell cycle arrest
and apoptosis by several mechanisms. It activates cell cycle inhibitors such as p21
and upregulation of proapoptotic genes such as Bax. Inactivating mutations of p53
are found in more than 50% of all cancers. The majority of p53 mutations (~75%)
are missense mutations, usually within the DNA-binding domain that results in an
abnormal tertiary structure with impaired ability to regulate transcription of target
genes. Hypermethylation of the promoter for p53 and upregulation of its inhibitors,
such as HDM-2 are also found in human cancers. Patients with Li–Fraumeni
263

syndrome have germline mutations in the p53 gene and are at high risk for earlyonset cancers of multiple tissues types, including breast, bone, soft tissue, head and
neck, and brain and, less commonly, lung, stomach, colon, and blood (leukemia). In
sporadic cancers, the timing of p53 loss can differ. p53 alterations are usually early
events in lung, esophageal, head and neck, breast, cervical, bladder, and stomach
cancers, but are late events in brain, thyroid, prostate, and ovarian cancers. There is
no consistent pattern in p53 alterations in colon, bladder, and liver cancers.
Delivery of p53 by gene therapy is currently in clinical trials. 9
TUMOR METASTASIS
Tumor metastasis warrants more detailed discussion because it accounts for
more than 90% of cancer deaths. In most cancers, metastatic trait is acquired late in
the multistep oncogenic process. However, clinically the natural history, route and
site of metastasis vary with different cancers, which underscore the complex
signaling mechanisms behind metastasis. In fact, metastasis in itself is a
consummation of multiple distinct properties that an extremely small number of
cancer cells acquire during evolution from a genetically heterogeneous population.
10 These properties include:
Detachment from the primary tumor. Adherence of tumor cells to
adjacent cells and extracellular matrix is almost always altered.
Intercellular adhesion is greatly diminished by downregulation of normal
adhesion proteins such as E-cadherin and interactions with extracellular
matrix is augmented by expression of specific integrins such as α;6β4.
These changes facilitate detachment of tumor cells from their primary
locus.
Invasion, migration, and intravasation. Expression of integrins such
as α6β4 can greatly augment the invasion of cancer cells through
stroma. Disruption of basement membrane is usually achieved via
activation of metalloproteases. By undergoing epithelial-to-mesenchymal
transition, cancer cells of epithelial origin acquire a mesenchymal cell
phenotype that allows for motility and invasion.11 Migration is further
directed by various growth factors such as EGF, FGF, HGF and insulin-like
growth factor. Subsequently, cancer cells are able to penetrate vascular
endothelial lining (intravasation) and enter the bloodstream or lymphatic
system.
Survival in the vasculature or lymphatic system. Once in the
264

circulation or lymphatic system, cancer cells must evade immune
recognition as described before. Also, by abrogating their major
apoptotic machinery, cancer cells are able to avoid anoikis, a type of
apoptosis triggered by loss of contact with extra-cellular matrix.
Nonetheless, most cancer cells succumb to the high-velocity shear stress
within the circulation and only a tiny number of cells survive to reach
target organs.
Arrest at the metastatic site and extravasation. The anatomy of
blood and lymphatic vasculature, as well as presence of specific
chemokines is an important determinant of the site of metastasis. For
example, breast cancer cells have high expression of the chemokine
receptor, CXCR4, while its ligand, CXCL12, is highly expressed in organs
to which it most commonly metastasizes: lung, liver, bone, and regional
lymph nodes. Once at the target organ site, cells must arrest in the
vasculature and extravasate, which again involves alterations in cell
adhesion molecules and proteases.
Survival in the metastatic microenvironment. Once at the target
organ, tumor cells (seeds) must successfully interact with their
microenvironment (soil) in order to initiate colonization. In addition,
angiogenic “switch” must be triggered by secretion of various angiogenic
factors to sustain metastatic growth.
FUTURE
The discovery of important signaling pathways propelling certain cancer has led
to successful stories of targeted agents such as imatinib, and currently more targeted
agents are being developed and tested. However, most cancers consist of highly
heterogeneous subpopulations of transformed cells that are driven by complex
network of signaling mechanisms. Therefore, it is highly unlikely that targeting one
or two signaling pathways is sufficient in curbing cancer growth in most cases. The
advent of new, high-throughput techniques such as microarray, genomic sequencing
(termed oncogenomics) and recently functional proteomics, in conjunction with
bioinformatics and system biology now allow broader view into the signaling
lesions underlying every type of cancer, with the potential of allowing combinations
of targeted agents. 12 Importantly, these techniques are beginning to redefine or
reclassify many cancers based on their molecular profile rather than histology alone.
Application of these techniques in aiding diagnosis and treatment decision will
265

likely become more common in the future and become a crucial part in personalizing
cancer management.

GENERAL PRINCIPLES

The management of malignancy with chemotherapy is the specific specialty of
hematologist and medical oncologists. The appropriate and safe use of
chemotherapy requires an understanding of various factors including, but not
limited to, principles of the cell cycle and tumor growth kinetics, timing of
chemotherapy administration, chemotherapy response assessment, and
pharmacology of chemotherapy agents, including mechanisms of action,
pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic properties, adverse effects, and
mechanisms of drug resistance. Therefore, the prescribing and administration of
these agents should only be done by those specifically trained and experienced
healthcare professionals. The intent of this chapter is to provide a brief
overview of some of the general principles of chemotherapy, various classes of
chemotherapy agents, their respective mechanisms of action, and selected
adverse effects.1,2 See Table 16-1 for chemotherapy agent classification,
mechanisms of action, selected toxicities, and other pertinent information
relating to these agents.
Endocrine-related tumors are often affected by hormone therapy (e.g.,
antiestrogens in breast cancer, thyroid hormone to suppress thyroid cancer, and
antiandrogens to inhibit prostate cancer). These agents are not discussed here,
and the reader is referred to Chapters 18, 25, and 26 for more information
regarding those tumors. In addition, please see Chapter 34 for a discussion of
nonchemotherapeutic medications and symptomatic and supportive treatments
for patients with cancer.
267

Most chemotherapy agents are toxic to cells of the human body. The
justification for using substances that are toxic to normal cells is that malignant
cells are preferentially sensitive to the effects of chemotherapy. A balance must
be struck between toxicity to malignant and harm to benign, normal tissues that
are intended to be spared. This concept is described as the therapeutic index,
which is the ratio of toxicity to tumor cells to that of normal cells. The
therapeutic index is quite narrow for many antineoplastic agents. Traditional
chemotherapeutic agents interfere with normal cell processes, typically DNA
synthesis or repair. However, it should be appreciated that these agents may act
in methods other than simple cell killing (e.g., as initiators of apoptosis or
cellular maturation agents).
Several newer agents have been developed that depart from the traditional
concept of cell killing as their primary action. These agents are targeted to
specific receptors in or on the cancer cell, often in signal transduction pathways
that regulate tumor cell growth, proliferation, migration, angiogenesis, and
apoptosis. Recent advances in cancer have led to the identification of several
specific molecular targets for drug therapy.

Cell Cycle

The growth and division of cells can be conceptualized by the cell cycle. There
are several phases to the life cycle of the dividing cell, including the g rowth
(G) phase, synthesis (S) phase, and mitosis (M) phase. There also is a “rest”
phase, or G0, in which cells are not actively participating in the cell cycle.
Cells can then undergo terminal differentiation or re-enter the cell cycle.
One of the factors that influence the development of chemotherapy regimens is
the phase at which the chemotherapy agent works in the cell cycle. Many
chemotherapeutic agents are cell cycle specific (e.g., they have activity only in
277

certain phases of the cell cycle). Those that are non-cell cycle specific may
cause damage to a cell during any phase of the cell cycle.

INTRODUCTION
Radiation oncology unifies the study of cancer with the therapeutic use of
radiation. The radiation oncologist is the medical specialist who decides when and
how to best use radiation. Under the supervision of the radiation oncologist, an array
of nonmedical specialists, including physicists, dosimetrists, and technicians, assist
in the planning and delivery of radiation to patients. This chapter introduces some of
the basic principles of radiation oncology, some common treatment strategies, and an
overview of the common toxicities that may be encountered in the inpatient setting.
PHYSICAL AND BIOLOGIC PRINCIPLES

Ionizing radiation is energy that causes the ejection of an orbital
electron. It may be either electromagnetic (photons or gamma rays) or
particulate (electrons, protons, or other atomic particles). The energy of
photons that can be generated in the clinic has increased over the years,
which allows more doses to be delivered to internal malignancies while
respecting the tolerance of the skin to radiation. Radiation dose is
measured as energy per unit mass, where 1 joule (J)/kg is 1 gray (Gy).
The previously used term, rad, is equal to 1 centigray (cGy).
Radiation causes DNA damage in both normal tissues and tumor cells. In
general, cells are most susceptible in the G1, G2, and M phases of the
cell cycle. Susceptible cells may enter apoptotic cell death by a variety of
mechanisms or undergo necrosis. Hypoxic cells are thought to be less
279

susceptible to radiation than well-oxygenated cells, owing to preferential
free radical formation. Fractionated radiotherapy (radiation given in
multiple small doses over a given period instead of a single large dose)
allows normal tissue to repair sublethal damage and repopulate while
the tumor cells re-sort themselves in the cell cycle and become better
oxygenated. A great deal of current research involves the cell cycle–
signaling pathways involved in each aspect of the damage, repair, and
reoxygenation pathways.1
RADIATION TREATMENT GOALS AND METHODS

Radiation can be given by directing x-rays from a treatment machine to
the patient (external beam radiotherapy) or by placing a radioactive
source in close proximity to the patient (brachytherapy).
Brachytherapy is most often used in gynecologic cancers, prostate
cancer, and head and neck cancer. Sometimes both techniques are used
to provide the optimal dose distribution.2
Advances in imaging and external beam delivery now allow for ablative
radiation techniques (stereotactic radiotherapy). These techniques
require very precise immobilization and deliver large doses of highly
focused radiation in a few (i.e., 1 to 5) fractions. Stereotactic
radiotherapy works best for smaller, well-defined lesions such as limited
brain/liver metastases or early-stage lung cancer.
Radiation can be given for curative or palliative intent and commonly is
the definitive treatment. Often, it is combined with chemotherapy and
surgery in the complete cancer care of the patient. It can be given before
(neoadjuvant) or after (adjuvant) the definitive therapy. Many solid
tumors are treated with radiation and chemotherapy at the same time
(concurrent chemoradiation).
Accurate tumor localization is essential for optimum delivery of
radiation. This can be done clinically (e.g., in palliative cases and
gynecologic cancers) or using radiographic studies. Clinical localizations
are quick and allow the patient to start treatment immediately but do
not allow for conformal delivery of radiation. To plan most radiotherapy,
the patient needs to have a simulation (“sim”) in which he or she is
brought to the radiation oncology department to make a treatment plan.
This plan will aid in delivering the maximal dose of radiation to tumor
280

tissue while attempting to avoid healthy tissue. Often, specialized
immobilization devices are constructed for the patient during simulation
to reduce intertreatment variation in patient position. After the
simulation, the radiation oncologist develops a treatment plan. Because
the time between the initial consultation and the first treatment is often
2 to 3 weeks, patients are best served by early radiation oncology
consultation.
In general, for external-beam radiotherapy, a patient will be placed on a
flat, mobile treatment table each day during the course of radiation
therapy. Marks on the patient’s skin and any immobilization devices are
used to obtain accurate and precise patient positioning. Each treatment
may last 10 to 30 minutes. The total course of radiation therapy can vary
from 1 day (prostate brachytherapy, some stereotactic treatments) to
several weeks (fractionated external-beam radiotherapy). Most
fractionated treatment is given once a day, 5 days per week, although
some treatments are given more frequently.
INDICATIONS FOR URGENT RADIATION THERAPY
Urgent radiation therapy is useful in certain oncologic emergencies. Spinal cord
compression is the only true radiation oncology emergency and is described further
in Chapter 35. It is imperative that radiation oncology and surgical services are
consulted early and that an MRI of the entire spine is obtained as soon as possible.
Brain metastases can be treated with radiation therapy, with timing based on
symptoms and performance status. Uncontrolled bleeding of tumors (commonly
breast, gynecologic, lung, colon, or bladder) often responds well to radiation
therapy. Superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome, in which the SVC is compressed by
tumor (typically small-cell lung cancer), can be palliated by radiation, with
resolution after weeks of therapy. Although SVC syndrome by itself is rarely fatal,
these tumors frequently encase other critical structures of the mediastinum.
LATE EFFECTS AND TISSUE TOLERANCE
Radiation therapy balances side effects to normal tissue with the need to deliver
adequate doses to the tumor. Side effects are considered to be either late (months to
years after completion of radiation therapy) or acute (during radiation therapy). The
281

radiation tolerance of normal tissue varies from patient to patient and depends on
dose, fractionation scheme, and exposed tissue volume. The most common
fractionation scheme is 1.8 to 2 Gy/d. Table 17-1 briefly summarizes the best
available human data. These data represent only general parameters, and a radiation
oncologist may elect to exceed these dose levels or be more conservative based on
individual patient considerations.
COMMON TREATMENT GUIDELINES AND
ASSOCIATED ACUTE EFFECTS
The following is a brief description of current “off-protocol” treatment
regimens. It must be emphasized that many patients are treated according to research
protocols, which vary considerably. Acute toxicities of radiation therapy typically
result from direct tissue damage within the radiation path. Most radiation-alone
acute effects can be managed on an outpatient basis. However, with concurrent
chemoradiation, acute effects increase substantially and may require inpatient
management. This is especially seen with head and neck, lung, and gastrointestinal
cancers.
Palliative Therapy

Palliative treatment of brain and bone metastases is given at doses of 20 to 40
Gy over 1 to 3 weeks. This is a larger fraction size than used in most curative
treatments, because there is less concern about late effects and a greater interest in
minimizing treatment time for patient convenience.
Bone Metastases

Bone metastases can be treated with 6- to 8-Gy single doses, or with 30 Gy in
fractions of 3 Gy/d, depending on the number and location of lesions and the
patient’s life expectancy. For patients with multiple bone metastases, an infusion of
radioactive strontium, samarium, or yttrium can be used to decrease pain.
Lung Cancer

Stage III non-small-cell lung cancer is often treated with definitive radiotherapy,
typically combined with chemotherapy and to a dose of 60 to 70 Gy. Recently,
stereotactic radiation therapy has been shown to be promising for medically
inoperable stage I and II lung cancer patients. In many patients, the mediastinum is
irradiated, which can result in the acute toxicity of esophagitis. The resultant
282

odynophagia can lead to dehydration or significant weight loss, which may require
inpatient management. Shortly after the completion of radiotherapy, radiation
pneumonitis or, very rarely, radiation pericarditis may occur. Anti-inflammatory
steroid therapy is the mainstay of treatment for both of these conditions. Threedimensional conformal radiation therapy, involving treatment planning based on CT
scans, is being investigated as a method to increase dose to tumor while avoiding
normal lung. Radiation therapy is used as adjuvant treatment in select cases of
locally advanced non-small-cell lung cancer treated with definitive surgery. Both
chemotherapy and radiation therapy play a central role in the definitive management
of limited-stage small-cell lung cancer.

Esophageal Cancer

Radiation therapy with concurrent chemotherapy is used either as definitive
treatment for esophageal/gastroesophageal junction tumors or as neoadjuvant
treatment. Esophagitis is the major acute toxicity.
Central Nervous System Cancer

After maximal safe surgical resection, primary brain tumors may be treated to 50
to 60 Gy, depending on the area of the brain involved. Brain metastases are normally
283

treated to 20 to 30 Gy. Stereotactic radiosurgery, either by linear accelerator or by
gamma knife, can be used for patients with few metastatic lesions that are <4 cm in
size. Radiosurgery involves a single day of treatment. Mild mental deterioration is
seen in children and the elderly. Neurologic changes requiring hospitalization are
generally due to tumor progression, not toxicity from radiosurgery.
Head and Neck Cancer

In general, early-stage head and neck cancers are treated equally well with
surgery or radiation. Advanced head and neck cancers require surgery and
postoperative radiation, radiotherapy alone, or chemoradiation. Doses are typically
60 to 70 Gy. Multiple treatments per day (hyperfractionation) are often used. Side
effects include xerostomia, odynophagia, dysphagia, and hoarseness. Acute toxicity
often results in dehydration, which may require administration of IV fluids or
placement of a gastric tube for nutritional support. Chemotherapy has been shown to
improve outcome in the definitive radiotherapy of advanced head and neck cancers
at the cost of 1% to 3% treatment-associated mortality and 20% to 30% risk of
hospitalization for esophagitis. Treatment-associated deaths are rare with
radiotherapy alone, and the frequency of hospitalization for acute toxicity is
generally ≤10%.
Breast Cancer

Radiation is used in breast conservation therapy as well as postmastectomy
patients with large initial tumors, positive lymph nodes, or positive resection
margins. The dose to the breast is normally 54 to 60 Gy. For early-stage breast
conservation therapy, partial breast radiation therapy is being investigated as a
shorter-course, lower-volume alternative to whole-breast radiation. Acute side
effects are usually limited to skin reactions, but pneumonitis, lymphoedema, and
carditis can occur as late reactions. Hospitalization is a distinctly rare event for any
acute radiotherapy effect in the breast.
Prostate Cancer

Prostate cancer can be treated with either external-beam radiation therapy or
prostate brachytherapy (“seeds”). External-beam radiation consists of 70 to 80 Gy.
The most common side effects are urethritis and cystitis, which are managed on an
outpatient basis in the vast majority of patients. Rates of impotence and cure are
similar among external-beam radiation therapy, brachytherapy, and radical
prostatectomy.
284

Colon/Rectal Cancer

Radiation is not often used in colon cancers, except in those that are locally
advanced (often fixed or perforated) and require preoperative radiation therapy. The
confines of the pelvis make surgical resection of rectal cancer more challenging than
that of colon cancer. Preoperative radiation therapy is used in most cases to
facilitate surgical resection, for sphincter preservation, and to treat the poorly
accessible presacral lymph nodes. Rectal cancer doses are 20 to 50 Gy, depending
on the size of the lesion and whether radiation is given before or after surgery.
Radiation therapy–induced proctitis is generally quite mild unless concurrent
chemotherapy (generally 5-fluorouracil) is administered, in which case proctitis can
be severe enough to cause dehydration leading to hospitalization. Patients may need
nutritional support.
Anal Cancer

Most anal malignancies can be managed with definitive radiotherapy plus
adjuvant chemotherapy, with surgery reserved for salvage. Although generally of
squamous histology, anal cancers respond well to low doses of radiotherapy.
Typical curative doses are 30 to 54 Gy, classically given with concurrent
mitomycin-C and 5-fluorouracil. Acute toxicities are mainly myelosuppression
caused by mitomycin-C, proctitis, cystitis, hemorrhoid exacerbation, and skin
reaction in the perineum.
Pediatric Cancer

Radiation is used in many pediatric tumors. Total-body irradiation and
irradiation of sanctuary sites are used in leukemia, and many lymphoma protocols
involve local irradiation. Many sarcomas are treated with radiation after or instead
of surgery. Most CNS tumors are treated in part with radiation. Treatment varies by
site, and long-term effects on development limit dose.
Lymphoma

Lymphomas are very radioresponsive, and doses from 20 to 45 Gy are used,
depending on the type of lymphoma and chemotherapy regimen. Treatment is
normally very well tolerated, with some cytopenia and fatigue with larger fields and
some nausea/vomiting when the abdomen is treated.
Total-Body Irradiation

285

Total-body irradiation is used as part of the preparative scheme for peripheral
blood stem cell transplant protocols. Treatment with 550 cGy in a single fraction is
very common, although fractionated total-body irradiation is also used in certain
protocols. This is normally well tolerated, except for self-limiting parotitis and
nausea and vomiting.
Gynecologic Cancer

Cervical and uterine corpus cancers are often treated with radiation therapy.
Most advanced cervical cancers are treated with definitive radiotherapy, and
numerous phase III trials have demonstrated equivalent survival outcome between
radical hysterectomy and radiotherapy for early cervical cancer. Radiation is
generally used as adjuvant therapy in uterine corpus tumors. Radiotherapy for most
gynecologic malignancies uses brachytherapy, because it better delivers the dose to
the at-risk tissues, while sparing the bladder and rectum. Doses are anywhere from
50 to 85 Gy. Patients can develop proctitis, enteritis, and urethritis/cystitis,
depending on the dose and tumor location. As with other sites, the frequency of
admission for acute toxicity increases with concurrent chemoradiation.
KEY POINTS TO REMEMBER
Consult a radiation oncology specialist before starting therapeutic
chemotherapy or surgery to allow for optimum multidisciplinary
management of the malignancy. Evaluating patients in their presenting
state is very valuable to the radiation oncologist.
When radiation toxicity is in the differential diagnosis, consult a radiation
oncolo-gist, who can help with diagnosis and treatment.
The only true radiation oncology emergency is spinal cord compression,
although there are other “urgent” indications for radiation therapy.
Consider urgent radiation oncology consults when faced with SVC
syndrome, new brain metastases, or uncontrolled bleeding.

GENERAL PRINCIPLES

Other than skin cancer, breast cancer is the most common cancer
diagnosed in women in North America. Breast cancer is second only to
lung cancer as the leading cause of cancer deaths among American
women.1 Although the incidence of breast cancer has continued to rise in
the United States over recent decades, the mortality appears to be
declining, suggesting a benefit from screening, withdrawal of hormone
replacement therapy (HRT), and improved therapy.
Definition

Breast cancers are neoplasms that originate from breast tissue. Breast
cancers, invasive and its precursor DCIS (ductal carcinoma in situ), most
commonly arise from the inner lining of the milk ducts or the lobules.
Classification

Pathologic classification
Most invasive breast cancers are adenocarcinomas that can be quite
heterogeneous in histologic appearance. Infiltrating (invasive) ductal
carcinoma accounts for ~80% of all breast cancers. Infiltrating ductal
carcinomas metastasize predominantly to the bones, liver, lungs, and
brain. Lobular carcinomas make up 10% of malignant breast cancers and
are associated with bilateral tumors in up to 20% of cases. Lobular
carcinomas also tend to be associated with multicentric disease within
the same breast, and have a predilection to metastasize to the
288

meninges, serosal surfaces, and mediastinal and retroperitoneal lymph
nodes. The loss of E-cadherin, which plays a role in cell adhesion, is a
key event in the development of invasive lobular breast cancers. Less
common subtypes of ductal carcinomas include mucinous and tubular,
which may carry a more favorable prognosis. Another variant, with
aggressive histological appearance but relatively good prognostic, is
medullary carcinoma. Metaplastic carcinoma of the breast, a neoplasm
with both epithelial and mesenchymal elements, is a rare (<1% of all
breast cancers) but aggressive breast tumor.
Noninvasive carcinomas, which are characterized pathologically by
the lack of penetration through the basement membrane into the
surrounding stroma, include DCIS and lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS),
which is not a true cancer but, instead, a marker for breast cancer risk.
DCIS is most often identified with an abnormal mammogram showing
clustered microcalcifications with or without a palpable mass. LCIS, on
the other hand, is not detected on physical examination or
mammography and is almost always an incidental finding in breast
biopsies performed for another reason.
Paget disease of the nipple is a specialized form of ductal carcinoma
that arises from the main excretory ducts in the breasts and involves the
skin of the nipple and areola.
Inflammatory carcinomas involve the lymphatic structures in the
dermis and infiltrate widely throughout the breast tissue. Inflammatory
carcinomas are not a special morphologic pattern but are clinically
diagnosed based on swelling, erythema, and tenderness in the involved
breast and are associated with more aggressive disease.
Biomarker classification
Apart from histology, breast cancer can also be conceptualized on the basis
of biomarkers, which bear implications for systemic treatment. Hormone
receptor (HR)-positive breast cancers express the estrogen receptor (ER)
and/or progesterone receptor (PgR), and are HER2 (human epidermal growth
factor receptor 2) negative. HER2 positive breast cancers demonstrate
overexpression or amplification of human epidermal growth factor Receptor
2/homologue of the oncogene neu (HER2/neu), a member of the epidermal
growth factor receptor (EGFR) family. Triple negative breast cancers are
negative for ER, PgR, and HER2/neu.
Intrinsic subtypes by molecular profiling
More recently, gene expression profiling techniques were used to separate
289

breast cancer into distinctive molecular subtypes with prognostic
significance.2,3 Molecular subtypes include luminal A and luminal B, HER2
enriched, and basal. Luminal A breast cancers are typically HR positive with
low proliferation indices. Like luminal A breast cancers, luminal B breast
cancers are also HR positive. However, luminal B breast cancers have higher
proliferation indices and are associated with poorer outcomes compared to
luminal A breast cancers. The HER2-enriched breast cancers are usually, but
not always, HER2 positive. Basal-like breast cancers are usually triple
negative, although the two terms are not synonymous. More recently, a new
subtype, the claudin-low, was identified. Claudin-low tumors tend to be ER-,
PgR-, and HER2/neu-negative (“triple-negative”) invasive ductal carcinoma
with a high frequency of metaplastic differentiation. These tumors carry a poor
prognosis.
Epidemiology

209,060 (1,970 men; 207,090 women) new cases of breast cancers will
be diagnosed in 2010, and 40,230 deaths will occur. Although most
breast cancers occur in women, ~1% of new cases annually occur in
men. The lifetime risk of developing breast cancer in women (assuming
a life expectancy of 85 years) is approximately one in eight women. The
median age at diagnosis is in the seventh decade of life.1
Etiology

The etiology of breast cancer is unknown and likely multifactorial.
Several risk factors for developing breast cancer have been identified in
the literature.4
Risk Factors

Identifiable risk factors for breast cancer include a history of breast
cancer, female gender, increasing age, early menarche, late menopause,
nulliparity, older age at first live childbirth, family history of breast
cancer, genetic mutations such as BRCA1 and BRCA2, prolonged HRT,
previous exposure to therapeutic chest wall irradiation, and benign
proliferative breast disease such as atypical lobular or ductal hyperplasia.
With regard to behavioral activities, such as weight and diet, controversy
exists over whether there is a clear association of high-fat and low-fiber
290

diets and obesity with increased breast cancer risk. It appears that
regular physical activity has been shown to correlate with a reduced risk
of breast cancer. More than minimal alcohol intake (such as one to two
drinks per day) has been associated with an increased risk. Cigarette
smoking is a controversial risk factor, with some studies showing a
correlation with risk while other studies do not.
While the majority of breast cancers are sporadic, inherited breast cancer
is now well documented. BRCA1 and BRCA2 were identified as breast
cancer susceptibility genes in the 1990s.5,6 Mutations in BRCA1 and
BRCA2, which are inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion, are
responsible for ~90% of hereditary breast cancer diagnoses.
Approximately 5% to 10% of all women with breast cancer have a
germline mutation of the gene BRCA1 or BRCA2. BRCA1 (chromosome
17q21) and BRCA2 (chromosome 13q12–13) are associated with an
autosomal dominant inheritance pattern, younger age at diagnosis,
bilateral disease, multiple affected family members, and an association
with other cancers, especially ovarian. Specific mutations of BRCA1 and
BRCA2 are also more common in women of Ashkenazi Jewish descent. In
a combined analysis of 22 studies, the average cumulative risk of
developing breast cancer by age 70 years in BRCA1 and BRCA2 carriers
were 65% (95% confidence interval of 44% to 78%) and 45% (31% to
56%), respectively. The corresponding risk of developing ovarian cancer
was 39% (18% to 54%) and 11% (2.4% to 19%) for BRCA1 and BRCA2
carriers, respectively.7 Other, less common but established hereditary
causes for breast cancer include Li–Fraumeni syndrome (p53 gene
mutations), Cowden syndrome or multiple hamartoma syndrome (PTEN
gene mutations), and Peutz–Jeghers syndrome (STK11 gene mutations).
Prevention

The Gail model is a statistical tool that calculates a woman’s risk of
developing breast cancer.8 Variables in the model include age, age at
menarche, age at first live birth, number of previous breast biopsies,
history of atypical ductal hyper-plasia, and number of first-degree
relatives with breast cancer.
Primary prevention of breast cancer with selective estrogen receptor
modulators (SERMs) has been evaluated in a number of studies including
the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP) P-1
291

trial and the Study of Tamoxifen and Raloxifene (STAR) trial. The NSABP
P-1 trial included women who were 35 years of age and older and had
either an absolute risk of at least 1.66% over a 5-year period on the
basis of the Gail model or a history of LCIS. In this trial, tamoxifen at a
dose of 20 mg daily for 5 years demonstrated a 49% reduction in the
incidence of invasive breast cancer.9 In the STAR trial, raloxifene was
compared to tamoxifen in high-risk postmenopausal women. Raloxifene
was equivalent to tamoxifen, but had a better side-effect profile,
including a lower incidence of thromboembolic events and uterine
hyperplasia.10
Secondary prevention (screening) measures include monthly breast
self-examination and radiographic imaging to detect early cancers.
Monthly breast self-exam (BSE) is frequently advocated as a
screening tool for breast cancer, but there is little evidence showing its
effectiveness in reducing mortality rates in breast cancer.11 The United
States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends against
clinicians teaching women how to perform BSE.12
Regular mammographic screening has a sensitivity and specificity
of 77% to 95% and 94% to 97%, respectively.11 Younger women have
more false-positive mammograms and require additional imaging, but
fewer biopsies than older women. The USPTF modified its
recommendations on screening mammography. The revised version
recommended against routine screening mammography for women
between the ages of 40 and 49 years (in the absence of known genetic
predisposition), while recommending biennial mammography for women
aged 50 to 74 years.12 Although the relative risk reduction of screening
mammography on breast cancer mortality is similar between the two
groups (around 15%), the absolute risk reduction is higher in the older
women (ages 50 to 74 years) than in the younger women (ages 40 to 49
years).
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has also been found to be
superior to mammogram and ultrasound in young women and in women
with BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations, where mammography is less sensitive
and multicentric disease is more common.13
DIAGNOSIS

292

Clinical Presentation

A majority of breast cancers these days are diagnosed as the result of an
abnormal mammogram; however, any woman who presents with a new
breast mass should be evaluated with a complete history and physical
examination.
History

For patients presenting with a new breast mass, symptoms related to the
new mass, including duration, tenderness, relationship to menstrual
cycle, presence of nipple changes, and discharge, should be elicited. A
heightened concern for malignancy arises if nipple discharge is unilateral,
spontaneous, or bloody, especially in a postmenopausal woman. A
negative family history does not exclude malignancy, given that most
women who develop breast cancer do not have a family history. Patients
should be asked a detailed history concerning any prior breast biopsies
and personal and family history of breast, ovarian, and other
malignancies, as well as any personal history of breast cancer or other
malignancies. A full gynecologic history should be taken, including age at
menarche, age at menopause, use of oral contraceptives or exogenous
HRT (type and duration), age at first live birth, and number of
pregnancies.
Physical Examination

The physical characteristics of a breast mass can be helpful in
determining a diagnosis. One should begin with a careful inspection for
breast symmetry, contours, and retraction of the skin. Other changes in
the skin can include erythema, thickening, skin nodules, and peau
d’orange appearance. Close inspection of the nipple can reveal rashes,
ulceration, thickening, or discharge that may help identify an underlying
malignancy or Paget disease of the breast. The characteristics of any
palpable lumps in the breast should be noted, including the location,
size, shape, consistency, demarcation, tenderness, and mobility. A
complete examination for lymphadenopathy includes evaluation for
axillary, supraclavicular, and infraclavicular lymph nodes. The final
element of the breast examination is compression of the areola to try to
293

elicit any nipple discharge. A nonmilky or bloody unilateral nipple
discharge suggests underlying breast pathology and should be evaluated
further. The most common source of nipple discharge is an intraductal
papilloma, which is a benign lesion.
Differential Diagnosis

The individual risk of a primary breast cancer can be characterized as
high or low based on the patient’s age, presenting symptoms, history of
breast pathology, and family history. For example, a new breast mass in
a woman >40 years old should be considered malignant until proven
otherwise, whereas in women <35 years old with a similar lesion, cancer
is a possibility, which needs to be investigated further. The differential
diagnosis of a breast mass can be broad, including malignancies, such as
primary breast cancer, lymphoma, and sarcoma, and benign breast
lesions, such as cysts, fibroadenomas, and fat necrosis. Skin conditions,
such as sebaceous cysts, abscesses, or thrombophlebitis, may present
with a palpable mass. The history and physical exam will help aid in the
differential diagnosis, but ultimately a biopsy is required for confirmation.
Diagnostic Testing

Patients suspected of having breast cancer should undergo a biopsy to
obtain tissue for diagnosis and for biomarker evaluation. Imaging studies
are useful in the staging of the cancer.
Laboratories

Laboratory tests do not directly aid in the diagnosis or staging of breast
cancer, but can allow the clinician to focus on possible metastatic sites of
disease. Routine laboratory studies obtained are complete blood count
(bone marrow infiltration), liver function tests (liver metastasis), and
alkaline phosphatase (bone metastasis). Abnormal blood tests can also
give the physician an objective marker to assess for clinical response
after therapy in patients without identifiable measurable disease.
Tumor markers (CA15–3, CA27–29, CEA), although not specific, may be
elevated in patients with breast cancer. Tumor markers are not accurate
for screening or diagnostic purposes; thus they are not indicated in the
initial assessment of breast cancer. In the metastatic setting, however,
294

tumor markers may be elevated and the trend of elevation can assist in
monitoring for response to therapy.
Imaging

A solid mass is best evaluated with diagnostic mammography.
Mammography allows the physician to assess the radiographic
characteristics of the mass and the remainder of breast tissue in the
ipsilateral and contralateral breast. Ultrasound (US) can be useful to
determine whether a lesion is cystic or solid. In the evaluation of a
patient with breast cancer, especially in the setting where neoadjuvant
systemic therapy is contemplated, evaluation of the axillary lymph nodes
with US is indicated. In select situations, breast MRI may be useful in
identifying additional lesions or bilateral disease.
In patients with locally advanced disease or suspected metastatic
disease, computed tomography (CT) examination of the chest, abdomen,
and pelvis can be performed as clinically indicated, and may be useful in
identifying sites of metastatic disease. In patients with neurological
findings suggestive of brain metastases, a contrast-enhanced MRI of the
brain will be helpful.
Diagnostic Procedures

Any distinct breast mass should be considered for biopsy, even if the
mammogram is negative. Aspiration of a cystic mass may be helpful.
Cytology may reveal malignant cells, but the absence of malignant cells
does not rule out a malignant lesion.
After radiographic evaluation to determine the location and
characteristics of the mass, a biopsy can be obtained using several
different methods. Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) is a simple method for
obtaining material for cytologic exam that can be performed in the
clinician’s office. False-negative rates for FNA can be as high as 10%,
even among the most experienced technicians. FNA also cannot
distinguish in situ disease from invasive carcinoma. If a negative result is
obtained from FNA, a core-needle or excisional biopsy should be done to
obtain appropriate tissue for pathologic review. The majority of these
biopsies can also be performed in the outpatient setting. If the biopsy
reveals only normal breast tissue, then further surgical biopsy is
recommended if the lesion is suspicious for cancer. Needle localization or
295

stereotactic biopsies may be helpful in this situation. Excisional biopsy
is the gold standard, allowing complete histologic characterization
with regard to biomarkers as well as tumor grade. Excisional biopsy also
may serve as the definitive lumpectomy in certain clinical situations. In
patients who are slated to undergo neoadjuvant systemic therapy, a
biopsy of an abnormal appearing axillary lymph node may be warranted
as well for accurate staging.
TREATMENT

The treatment of breast cancer utilizes a multidisciplinary approach,
including local-regional treatment with surgery ± radiation therapy and
treatment of systemic disease with cytotoxic chemotherapy, hormonal
therapy, biologic therapy, or a combination of these agents. The
treatment plan for each patient is individualized based on the stage of
disease, patient’s age, comorbidities, menopausal status, and biomarker
profile. A simplified version of the American Joint Committee on Cancer
staging system is provided in Table 18-1.14 In addition to the various
prognostic and predictive factors, a patient’s preference is also a major
component of the decision-making process, especially when more than
one option may provide similar benefits.
In terms of treatment, breast cancer can be divided into four general
categories:
Noninvasive carcinoma, DCIS, and LCIS (stage 0)
Early-stage breast cancer that is operable (clinical stage I, stage II, and
some stage IIIA tumors)
Locally advanced or inoperable local-regional invasive carcinoma
(clinical stage IIIB, stage IIIC, and some stage IIIA)
Metastatic carcinoma (stage IV)

296

Noninvasive carcinoma/carcinoma in situ
Lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) is a misleading term, as it is not a
premalignant lesion. It is noted as an incidental finding on breast
biopsies performed for another reason. It is a marker that identifies
women at an increased risk (21% over 15 years) for the development of
invasive breast cancer that may occur equally in either breast. Of note,
the majority of subsequent cancers are infiltrating ductal rather than
lobular carcinomas. LCIS can be managed by observation alone after
biopsy. There is no evidence that re-excision after the initial biopsy to
obtain histologically negative surgical margins is required. The increased
risk of breast cancer persists beyond 20 years, so careful observation and
diagnostic mammography should be performed indefinitely in these
297

women. Bilateral prophylactic mastectomies are an alternate option for
women who are uncomfortable with the increased risk of developing
breast cancer, for patients with a strong family history of breast cancer,
or for patients with known BRCA1 / BRCA2 mutations. Radiation therapy
has no role in the management of LCIS. According to results from the
NSABP-P1 study, tamoxifen, when taken for 5 years, is associated with a
56% decrease in the risk of all breast cancer events in women with LCIS.
Results from the NSABP Study of Tamoxifen and Raloxifene (STAR) trial
has also shown raloxifene to be as effective as tamoxifen in reducing the
risk of invasive cancer in postmenopausal patients with LCIS.9,10
Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), also known as intraductal
carcinoma, is being encountered more frequently with the increased use
of screening mammography. Surgical treatments for DCIS range from
local excision to total mastectomy. Total mastectomy results in a 98%
long-term disease-free survival (DFS) rate for noninvasive cancer;
however, it is now generally accepted that a lumpectomy followed by
radiation therapy to the breast represents the optimal treatment option,
as no difference in mortality has been found between lumpectomy and
mastectomy.15 Local chest wall irradiation reduces the rate of ipsilateral
breast tumor recurrences by >50% compared to lumpectomy alone.
Contraindications for breast-conserving surgery followed by radiation
include (1) inability to completely excise the underlying disease to
negative surgical margins, (2) multifocal disease, and (3) patient
contraindication to receive radiation. Routine axillary nodal dissection is
not recommended, given a low (<5%) incidence of axillary nodal
metastases in patients with DCIS. According to the NSABP-B24 trial,
tamoxifen given after surgery and radiation has been demonstrated to
reduce the rate of all breast cancer events (noninvasive or invasive),
ipsilateral tumors and new contralateral tumors.16
Early breast cancer
Surgery. The surgical options for the management of early breast
cancer include breast-conserving therapy (BCT) followed by radiation
therapy or total mastectomy. Randomized clinical trials have proven that
overall survival (OS) is equivalent between BCT followed by radiation
therapy and mastectomy in women with early breast cancer. The
selection of a surgical approach depends on the location and size of the
tumor, other abnormalities present on the mammogram, the breast size,
298

and the patient’s attitude toward breast preservation. Multicentric
disease (two or more primary tumors in separate quadrants), extensive
malignant-appearing microcalcifications on imaging, pregnancy, and
previous breast or mantle irradiation are absolute contraindications for
BCT. Relative contraindications for BCT include tumors >5 cm and active
connective tissue disease involving the skin, such as scleroderma.
Axillary lymph node dissection: This remains an important part of
the surgical approach, given the prognostic importance of lymph node
involvement. In an effort to decrease the morbidity associated with
axillary lymph node dissection (especially lymphedema and pain), while
maintaining accurate staging, a sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy can be
obtained. The SLN (the first node in the lymphatic chain that receives
lymphatic flow from the entire breast) is at the highest risk for harboring
occult metastatic disease in breast cancer patients. Vital blue dye and/or
technetium-labeled sulfur are injected in and around the tumor or biopsy
site. The surgeon maps the dye or radioactive compound drainage to the
axilla and identifies the SLN, which is then biopsied. The SLN can be
identified in >90% of patients with breast cancer, with false-negative
rates ranging from 0% to 10%. No further axillary node dissection is
needed if the SLN biopsy is negative. If the SLN is positive for
malignancy, further treatment options include a full axillary lymph node
dissection (ALND), axillary radiation with no further surgery, and
adjuvant chemotherapy. One recent randomized clinical trial suggested
that complete ALND can be avoided in patients with small tumors
(T1,T2), with fewer than 3 SLN involvement.17 SLN biopsies are only
performed on women without palpable, clinically suspicious, axillary
lymph nodes on physical examination.
Adjuvant radiation therapy: Radiation therapy to the intact breast
after BCT is the standard treatment based on several randomized trials
that have shown higher local recurrence rates with BCT alone compared
to BCT with radiation therapy. Radiation treatments are administered
daily to the intact breast over a 5- to 6-week period to a total dose of 45
to 50 Gy. A radiation boost to the tumor bed is often administered.
Patients with positive axillary nodes may benefit from regional nodal
irradiation in addition to irradiation of the intact breast. Postmastectomy
adjuvant chest wall and axillary radiation is considered for the following:
positive surgical margins, primary tumors >5 cm, and involvement of
299

four or more lymph nodes. Radiation therapy can decrease the rates of
local recurrence even among patients who receive adjuvant
chemotherapy. Certain chemotherapy agents such as anthracyclines
have radiation-sensitizing effects and should not be given concurrently
with radiation. Typically, adjuvant radiation is given following the
completion of adjuvant chemotherapy.
Adjuvant systemic therapy. Systemic treatment has the greatest
impact when used in the adjuvant setting rather than metastatic setting.
Adjuvant systemic therapy with cytotoxic chemotherapy, hormonal
therapy, and HER2-targeted agents has demonstrated significant
improvement in DFS and OS in both premenopausal and postmenopausal
women in general. Given that not all patients with early state breast
cancers recur, it is important to identify high-risk patients who will
benefit the most and spare cytotoxic chemotherapy for the subset of
patients with low-risk features. Selecting candidates for adjuvant
systemic therapy of early breast cancers is thus based on
clinicopathologic factors and more recently based on gene expression
analysis.
Predicting benefits of systemic therapy. The development and
validation of prognostic and predictive models is an area of active
research and can be useful in the right clinical scenario for decision
making. The clinical and pathologic prognostic determinants of adjuvant
therapy are patient age, comorbidities, tumor size, histologic grade or
differentiation, histologic type, number of involved axillary lymph nodes,
dermal lymphatic invasion, markers of proliferation, HR status, and HER2
status. Several clinically useful prognostic indices that incorporate some
of these clinical variables have been developed. Adjuvantonline, is one
such validated Web-based tool that includes patient age, comorbidities,
HR status, tumor grade, tumor size, and lymph node status to estimate
risk of death and relapse from breast cancer and can estimate benefits of
adjuvant chemotherapy and hormonal therapy
(www.adjuvantonline.com). Several gene expression–based
prognostic assays, such as Oncotype Dx and Mammaprint, are also
commercially available. These multigene assays are mostly independent
of clinicopathologic prognostic factors, and hence the treating oncologist
has to familiarize the clinical contexts when these tests are applicable.
Adjuvant chemotherapy. Polychemotherapy in the adjuvant setting
300

in early breast cancer reduces the annual breast cancer death rate by
~38% for women <50 years of age and by ~20% for those aged 50 to
69 years, largely irrespective of use of tamoxifen, nodal status, tumor
characteristics, and HR status.18 Chemotherapy is recommended for
most patients with node-positive disease, and adjuvant chemotherapy in
node-negative patients is usually recommended if the tumor is >1 cm.
The benefit of adding adjuvant chemotherapy to hormonal therapy in
ER+ stage 1 or node-negative stage 2 is very small when compared to
the benefits of hormonal therapy alone. The risk and benefits of adding
chemotherapy in such situations have to be based on available
clinicopathologic prognostic factors, existing comorbid conditions, and
further evaluation with the aid of modern Web-based and genome-based
prognostic tools. If chemotherapy is considered, less aggressive
regimens should be considered in this patient population. The current
standard of practice is to initiate adjuvant chemotherapy 4 to 5 weeks
after surgery, before the initiation of radiation. Some of the adjuvant
chemotherapy regimens are outlined in Table 18-2. Most modern and
widely used chemotherapy regimens are taxanes and anthracyclinebased regimens. Current literature supports that four to six courses of
treatment provide optimal benefit. Available data also suggest a possible
improved response with anthracycline-containing regimens for HER2positive patients. For node-positive breast cancer, the addition of a
taxane to anthracycline-containing chemotherapy improves DFS and OS.
Dose-dense chemotherapy for node-positive patients with Adriamycin
and cyclophosphamide followed by paclitaxel with growth factor support
is a more intensive regimen that has also shown to improve DFS and OS.
Adjuvant hormonal therapy. Patients with invasive breast cancer
that is ER or PR positive should be considered for adjuvant hormonal
therapy, regardless of the patient’s age, menopausal status, or lymph
node status or whether or not adjuvant chemotherapy is to be
administered. Adjuvant hormonal therapy should not be recommended in
patients whose breast cancers are ER or PR negative because clinical
trials have not shown any benefit in DFS or OS.

301

Tamoxifen. It belongs to the group of drugs called SERM, inhibits the
growth of breast cancer cells by competitive antagonism of estrogen at
the ER. Tamoxifen is a well-established form of hormonal therapy for
both premenopausal and postmenopausal women. In women with ERpositive early breast cancer, adjuvant tamoxifen decreased the risk of
recurrence by 40% to 50% and the risk of death by 30% to 40%
irrespective of the use of chemotherapy, age, menopausal status, or
axillary lymph node status.18 Tamoxifen also decreased the incidence of
breast cancer in the contralateral breast by ~50%. Prospective
randomized trials have demonstrated that the optimal duration of
tamoxifen is 5 years and that longer treatment may trend toward a
detrimental effect. In patients receiving both tamoxifen and
chemotherapy, chemotherapy should be given first.
Aromatase inhibitors (AIs). In postmenopausal women the primary
302

source of estrogen is the peripheral conversion of androgens to estrogen
by the enzyme aromatase. Several studies have utilized AIs in the
treatment of postmenopausal women with early-stage breast cancer.
These studies have utilized AI as upfront initial therapy, as sequential
therapy following 2 to 3 years of tamoxifen, or as extended therapy
following 5 years of tamoxifen. Two upfront studies, BIG I-98 and ATAC,
have compared letrozole versus tamoxifen and anastrozole versus
tamoxifen, respectively. Both studies have shown an improved DFS with
the AI compared to tamoxifen when used in the upfront setting.19,20
Several trials have also studied the use of sequential AI following either
2 to 3 years of tamoxifen or 5 years of tamoxifen. The NCIC MA 17 trial
showed an improved DFS with continuation of letrozole versus placebo
following 5 years of tamoxifen. The Intergroup Exemestane Study
showed an improved DFS as well as a trend toward improved OS with
switching to exemestane following 2 to 3 years of tamoxifen versus
continuation of tamoxifen. Given the available data, aromatase inhibitors
are now largely used as the treatment of choice for postmenopausal
women with HR-positive early breast cancer.
Tamoxifen versus aromatase inhibitors. The two classes of drugs
have slightly different side-effect profiles. While both the agents can
cause hot flashes, night sweats, and vaginal dryness, AIs are more
commonly associated with musculoskeletal symptoms, osteoporosis, and
an increased rate of bone fracture, whereas tamoxifen is associated with
an increased risk of uterine cancer and deep vein thromboses.
Adjuvant HER2 targeted therapy. Trastuzumab is a humanized,
monoclonal antibody with specificity for the extracellular domain of
HER2/neu. A meta-analysis from five randomized trials of adjuvant
trastuzumab in HER2-positive breast cancer has shown significant
reduction in the mortality, recurrence, and metastases rate in patients
receiving trastuzumab with or following chemotherapy.21 A 33% to 52%
reduction in the risk of recurrence was seen across these four important
initial trials (NSABP B-31, NCCTG 9831, BCIRG 006, and HERA), with a
34% to 41% reduction in the risk of death.22 These data are compelling
to consider use of 1 year of adjuvant trastuzumab in combination with
anthracycline- and/or taxane-containing adjuvant chemotherapy
regimens and should be offered to all patients with HER2-positive early
breast cancer. The likelihood of cardiac toxicity was 2.4-fold higher in
303

trastuzumab arms in the clinical trials. A non-anthracycline-containing
regimen is the TCH (taxotere, carboplatin, trastuzumab), which offers
less cumulative cardiac toxicity.
Neoadjuvant therapy. Preoperative or neoadjuvant therapy with the
use of hormonal or chemotherapeutic agents has been shown to be
effective in downsizing the dimensions of the primary tumor, thus
allowing for BCT. Results of randomized trials suggest that this strategy
is safe and is equivalent to postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy with
the same regimen for operable stage I and II breast cancers. Between
10% and 15% of patients are noted to have a complete pathologic
response in the primary tumor after three or four cycles of an
anthracycline-containing regimen, and 20% to 30% of patients with
biopsy-proven lymph node metastases before neoadjuvant
chemotherapy have pathologically negative lymph nodes after
neoadjuvant chemotherapy. In postmenopausal women with HR-positive
cancer, a hormonal agent, such as an aromatase inhibitor, can be used
to shrink the primary tumor. While pathologic response rates following
neoadjuvant systemic therapy are prognostic, this modality of treatment
also has the advantage of testing in vivo sensitivity of the tumor to
systemic therapy and is an ideal setup to evaluate newer therapies and
develop predictive biomarkers of response.
Locally advanced breast cancer. Locally advanced breast cancer is
associated with a poor prognosis and a high rate of local and distant
recurrences. This group includes subsets of patients with tumors >5 cm,
inflammatory breast tumors, and any tumor with fixed or matted axillary
lymphadenopathy or internal mammary lymph node involvement.
Patients with locally advanced breast cancer need to be evaluated in
order to determine whether or not an initial surgical approach is likely to
achieve pathological negative margins and provide long-term local
control. Patients who present with clinical stage IIIA (except T3N1M0),
IIIB, or IIIC considered to have inoperable breast cancer at presentation
should receive more aggressive third-generation chemotherapy
regimens, such as dose-dense AC-T or TAC as the initial therapeutic
strategy. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy is an effective treatment approach
in this setting and may allow for tumor shrinkage to perform adequate
surgical resection with clear margins. Total mastectomy with lymph node
dissection with or without reconstruction or lumpectomy with axillary
304

dissection is recommended for local control. Given the high risk of
recurrence, all patients need radiation therapy after surgery. Adjuvant
systemic therapy with cytotoxic chemotherapy, hormonal therapy (ER
positive), and trastuzumab therapy (in HER2 positive) is considered
standard. Table 18-2 lists a few of the commonly used chemo-therapy
regimens.
Inflammatory breast cancer. This subset of stage III breast cancer is
one of the most aggressive forms of breast cancer. It is characterized by
a triad of clinical findings, namely, erythema, warmth, and edema of the
skin (peau d’orange) secondary to involvement of dermal lymphatics.
While an underlying mass may or may not be palpable, the condition can
be misdiagnosed for inflammatory or infectious condition. The biomarker
profile is most often (not always) HR and HER2 negative, and they are
characterized by rapid growth potential. Inflammatory breast cancers
should be treated aggressively with multiagent chemotherapy followed
by mastectomy and radiation. The overall prognosis is improving in the
recent years with more aggressive multimodality approach compared to
their historical dismal outcome.
Metastatic breast cancer (MBC). Patients with MBC are a
heterogeneous group of patients with varied presentations and clinical
course. The disease can vary from clinically indolent disease to rapidly
progressing disease with visceral involvement and resistance to therapy.
The primary goals of treatment for patients with metastatic disease are
to control the disease, palliate symptoms, and prolong survival. The
management of MBC depends on the site and extent of metastases,
comorbid conditions, HR status, and HER2/neu overexpression. Patients
with MBC can be divided into two groups for the sake of making
treatment decisions: patients with locoregional relapse and those with
systemic metastatic disease. Patients who have had BCT or mastectomy
and present with local recurrence are generally treated with mastectomy
and local resection respectively (if obtaining clear surgical margins
seems plausible) and radiation therapy if not received in the adjuvant
setting. Unresectable chest wall recurrences should be treated with
radiation therapy if the patient has not previously received this modality
of treatment. After local control, patients should be considered for
systemic chemotherapy or hormonal therapy given adjuvantly. Regional
lymph node recurrence is managed with surgical resection (or axillary
305

lymph node dissection, if not done before) and radiation therapy.
Systemic therapy is again considered for these patients as in the
adjuvant setting.
With regard to systemic metastatic disease, some of the important
decisions regarding treatment are made based on risk categories.
Patients in the low-risk group include those with a long disease-free
interval; HR-positive tumors; and bone, soft tissue, or limited visceral
organ involvement. High-risk groups include patients with rapidly
progressing disease or extensive visceral involvement, as well as
patients whose disease becomes refractory to hormonal therapy.
MBC treatment should be multidisciplinary, and support groups tend to
be very helpful. At some point in the clinical course, the disease burden
from MBC may interfere with the patient’s ability to tolerate further
treatment options, and supportive or palliative care should be offered to
the patient and family. Failure to achieve response to three sequential
chemotherapy regimens or an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group
(ECOG) performance status of ≥3 is believed to be an indication for
supportive therapy only.
Hormonal therapy. In low-risk patients with advanced or MBC and ERpositive disease, hormonal therapy can achieve high initial response
rates. ER-negative tumors exhibit no clinical benefit from first-line
hormonal therapy. The modern hormonal interventions are more
selective and are well tolerated. The list of the commonly used hormonal
agents in clinical practice is shown in Table 18-3. In postmenopausal
women with ER-positive tumors, a selective aromatase inhibitor is the
preferred first-line therapy. Hormonal therapy options such as
antiestrogen, fulvestrant, SERMs, and tamoxifen can be used in both
premenopausal and postmenopausal women. In premenopausal women,
although surgical or radiotherapeutic oophorectomy remains an option,
this has largely been replaced by luteinizing hormone–releasing hormone
(LHRH) analogs for effective hormonal ablation. The current options for
first-line treatment in premenopausal ER-positive women with locally
advanced or MBC include tamoxifen, some form of ovarian ablation, or
the combination of an LHRH agonist and tamoxifen. The combination of
LHRH agonist with tamoxifen in recent trials has resulted in better
outcomes when compared to LHRH alone with regard to improvement in
time to disease progression and survival.23 Single-agent, sequential
306

hormonal therapy is the preferred management in both premenopausal
and postmenopausal ER-positive breast cancer patients. With each
subsequent hormonal therapy, the duration of a clinical response
becomes shorter, and ultimately, the disease will become refractory to
hormone treatment. Second- and third-line hormonal therapy should be
chosen based on the adverse side-effect profile of each drug.
Interestingly, estradiol therapy can resensitize a patient to antiestrogen
therapies.24 Systemic chemotherapy can be recommended in patients
whose disease becomes refractory to multiple lines of hormonal therapy.

Chemotherapy. High-risk patients with rapidly progressive disease,
extensive visceral involvement, or disease that becomes refractory to
hormonal therapy may benefit from chemotherapy. Combination
chemotherapy generally provides higher rates of objective responses and
longer time to progression; however, these regimens are associated with
increased toxicity without adding survival benefit. Several chemotherapy
agents produce objective responses in MBC; while there are overlapping
toxicities of these agents, their specific toxicity profile and metabolism
should be kept in mind, especially given the relatively higher frequency
of renal and hepatic impairment in this patient population. Single-agent
sequential therapies are preferred in patients who are candidates for
chemotherapy, but are relatively asymptomatic with no impending
307

visceral crises. There is no convincing data if combination chemotherapy
provides better long-term outcomes than single-agent sequential
therapy. There is no consensus with regard to duration of therapy or
“chemotherapy holidays.” If the patient is tolerating chemotherapy well,
it is reasonable to continue therapy, and the basic management plan
would be to switch to a different regimen when patient develops
progressive disease if the patient desires further treatment. The list of
preferred chemotherapy options including sequential single agents and
combination chemotherapy as listed by the National Cancer Institute
(NCI) based on available data is shown in Table 18-4.25

Immunotherapies.
Trastuzumab. Among patients with MBC, HER2/neu overexpression
occurs in 25% to 30% of cases. Trastuzumab is approved for use in
combination chemotherapy or as a single agent in MBC. In the original
trials, the response rates using trastuzumab as a single agent in first-line
therapy were 20% to 25%. There are data suggesting benefit from
adding trastuzumab to anastrozole (in HR positive) and chemotherapy
308

agents such as taxanes, capecitabine, anthracyclines, vinorelbine, and
platinum compounds. It is also considered safe and effective to
incorporate trastuzumab in subsequent lines of therapy after progression
on trastuzumab.26,27 The use of trastuzumab in combination with
anthracyclines was associated with severe cardiac toxicity in up to 27%
of patients in the registration trial. Trastuzumab is not advised to be
used in combination with this drug class outside of a clinical trial.28
Bevacizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody against vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF). The FDA granted accelerated approval
for bevacizumab in February 2008 to be used in combination with
paclitaxel for treatment of patients with MBC, based on clinical trial that
showed an improvement in PFS with no impact on overall survival. In
December 2010, the FDA announced its recommendation to remove this
indication from the label because of lack of demonstration of overall
survival benefit with added adverse effects in subsequent studies. The
treating oncologists are advised to use their clinical judgment when
deciding whether to use this agent in treating MBC patients.
Other targeted therapies
Lapatinib is an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and ErbB-2
(HER2/neu) dual tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Lapatinib is approved for use
in the United States in HER2-overexpressing metastatic breast cancer in
combination with capecitabine and in combination with letrozole, if the
tumor is also HR positive.29,30
PARP inhibitors. The poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase is an enzyme used
by cancer cells to repair DNA damage. Tumors with BRCA1/BRCA2
mutations lose a form of DNA repair and thus rely heavily on the PARP
pathway. By blocking PARP in the already-compromised tumor cells, the
PARP inhibitors can cause cell death through a synthetic lethality
mechanism. Very promising data are emerging of its use in patients with
BRCA-mutated and triple-negative metastatic breast cancer, as a single
agent, and in combination with chemotherapy.31,32
Treatment of bone metastases. Although patients with bone-only
metastatic disease have a better prognosis than those with visceral
metastases, bone metastases can lead to serious complications such as
pain, fractures, spinal cord compression, and hypercalcemia.
Traditionally, treatment of symptomatic bone metastases has been with
analgesics, localized radiation, or surgery. Although improvements in
309

pain and quality of life have been achieved with the use of these
therapeutic options, their use for the prevention of progression of bone
lytic metastases has been ineffective.
Bisphosphonates. These agents improve bone health by inhibiting
osteoclast-mediated bone resorption. Their use, alone or in combination
with chemotherapy or hormonal therapy, has shown to reduce bone
pain, improves quality of life, reduces the risk of developing a skeletal
event, as well as increases the time to skeletal event. Intravenous
bisphosphonates commonly used are pamidronate (Aredia), as an IV
infusion of 90 mg over 2 hours and zoledronate (Zometa) with a much
shorter infusion time of 4 mg IV over 15 minutes. The optimal timing of
initiation and the duration of treatment remains uncertain.33
Denosumab. Denosumab is a fully humanized antibody against
receptor activator of nuclear factor κ B (RANK) ligand. Recently reported
randomized clinical trial comparing denosumab against zoledronic acid
showed superiority of denosumab with regard to delaying or preventing
skeletal-related events and equivalency with regard to overall survival.
With the convenience of a subcutaneous injection and no requirement for
renal monitoring, denosumab represents a potential treatment option for
patients with bone metastases.34
CNS metastases. Metastatic involvement of the CNS is commonly seen
in ER-negative, HER2-positive breast cancers that are poorly
differentiated. Solitary metastatic lesions are treated by either surgery or
radiosurgery, while whole-brain radiation should be considered for
patients with multiple meta-static lesions. Given the frequency of
occurrence in HER2-overexpressing breast cancers, it is important to
remember that trastuzumab, being a large molecule, does not cross
the blood–brain barrier while lapatinib, being a small molecule, is more
effective in CNS penetration. There is no standard treatment approach at
this time with regard to the use of other systemic therapy, and this is an
area of active research.
SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS

Genetic testing. Several indications for genetic testing for breast and
ovarian cancer exist: two or more family members with breast and/or
ovarian cancer at <50 years of age, breast or ovarian cancer at a very
310

young age, known BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations in a family member,
personal history of both breast and ovarian cancers, Ashkenazi Jewish
ancestry plus a family member younger than 50 years with breast
cancer, and a personal history of ovarian cancer. All patients should
undergo genetic counseling before undergoing genetic testing.
Breast cancer in pregnancy is an uncommon phenomenon, but one
that poses dilemmas for patients and their physicians. A multidisciplinary
approach, in consultation with a maternal-fetal medicine specialist, is
recommended for optimal clinical decision making. It has been estimated
that there are approximately 13 cases of breast cancer diagnosed per
100,000 live births.35,36 Breast cancer during pregnancy tends to present
at advanced stages with lymph node involvement, sometimes because
there is a delay in the diagnosis. Tumors tend to be poorly differentiated,
HR negative, and HER2 positive in 30% of cases. The initial workup
should evaluate for the presence of metastatic disease, as this may
influence the patient’s decision regarding maintenance of the pregnancy.
Estimation of delivery time will help in establishing the best treatment
options. Fetal growth needs to be monitored during treatment. Much of
the data regarding the management of pregnant breast cancer patients
with modalities such as surgery, chemotherapy, etc., are retrospective in
nature.36 Surgery remains the mainstay of treatment of breast cancer
during pregnancy, and in some circumstances breast-conserving surgery
is an acceptable option. SLN biopsy with technetium 99m is considered
safe; however, isosulfan blue dye should be avoided because of unknown
fetal effects and risk for anaphylaxis for the patient. Indications for
chemotherapy are the same as for nonpregnant patients, but it should
ideally not be given during the first trimester (may be teratogenic) or
after week 35, to avoid complications at the time of delivery. Reports of
fetal malformations fall in the range of 14% to 19% when chemotherapy
has been given in the first trimester. Chemotherapy regimens containing
anthracyclines or alkylating agents are most commonly used; if taxanes
are indicated, they should be used after delivery. Concern of the
effectiveness of taxanes during pregnancy has been raised secondary to
the upregulation of the cytochrome P-450 system during the third
trimester, thus potentially increasing drug metabolism. Trastuzumab,
hormonal therapy, and radiation therapy should be initiated only in the
postpartum period. Trastuzumab administration during pregnancy was
311

associated with oligo- and anhydramnios. Decisions regarding lactation
and future fertility should be addressed on a per-patient basis.
Male breast cancer is a rare disease. Less than 1% of breast cancer
patients are males. In contrast to female breast cancer, an estimated
4% to 40% of cases are thought to result from autosomal dominant
inheritance. Familial cases tend to be associated with BRCA2, and 20%
of patients with male breast cancer have a first-degree relative with the
disease.37 Known risk factors are those associated with hormonal
imbalance in estrogen and androgen levels. Patients with Klinefelter
syndrome, testicular pathology (e.g., cryptorchidism, testicular injury,
orchitis, or any other form of gonadal dysfunction), and infertility have an
increased risk. Obesity, increased alcohol intake, exposure to radiation,
high temperatures, and exhaust fumes are also considered risk factors.
Gynecomastia does not increase the risk of male breast cancer. Ninety
percent of the tumors are ER positive, and therefore, hormonal therapy
is a mainstay of treatment. At presentation, patients usually have stage
III or IV disease, but survival is comparable to that for female breast
cancer when matched for stage and grade. As male breast cancer is rare,
the principles of treatment are derived from randomized studies in
women with breast cancer. Mastectomy is the type of surgery usually
performed, followed usually by radiation therapy. Tamoxifen is the firstline therapy in ER-positive tumors. Chemotherapy can be used in cases
of hormone-refractory disease.
COMPLICATIONS

Lymphadema is a complication of breast cancer treatment. Impaired
lymphatic drainage in the ipsilateral arm may result from removal or
injury to axillary lymph nodes from lymph dissection and/or radiation.
Treatment of lymphadema depends on its severity and is usually handled
with the assistance of specially trained lymphadema specialists. The
most common treatments for lymphedema involve a combination of
compression garments or wraps, intermittent sequential multichambered
overlapping gradient pumps, and manual compression lymphatic
massage. Any of the treatments can be done individually.
MONITORING/FOLLOW-UP
312

Follow-up exams should be individualized either to reflect the patient’s
risk of recurrence or to monitor treatment or disease progression.
Posttreatment follow-up includes regular physical exam and
mammography. The first mammogram in patients undergoing BCT
should be after 6 months, and then yearly. No randomized trials have
demonstrated a benefit from routine laboratory or radiology testing
compared to a careful history and physical exam. The clinical role of
tumor markers (CEA, CA 15–3, CA 27–29) is also unproven. According to
the most recent NCCN guidelines, routine liver function tests, bone
scans, chest x-rays, CT scans, PET scans, or US is not recommended
unless clinical suspicion for recurrent/metastatic disease is suggested by
the history and/or physical exam. MRI can be considered as an option for
surveillance in women at high risk for bilateral disease, such as
BRCA1/BRCA2 mutation carriers, or in young women with dense breasts.
Female patients who are taking tamoxifen should undergo yearly
gynecologic evaluation if they have a uterus. Patients taking aromatase
inhibitors should have bone health monitoring, given the associated
increased risk of osteopenia and osteoporosis.
OUTCOME/PROGNOSIS

The most reliable and reproducible prognostic factor is the involvement
of axillary lymph nodes. Tumors <1 cm without nodal involvement have
a good prognosis. Tumors with a poorly differentiated histology and a
high nuclear grade have a worse prognosis. Estrogen receptor (ER) and
progesterone receptor (PgR) statuses are prognostic and also predictive
factors for the likelihood of benefit from hormonal therapy. The HER2
overexpression has been associated with a poor prognosis, but is a
strong predictive factor for response to anti-HER2 therapy, which has
altered its previously aggressive evolution.

GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Lung cancer is first divided into two broad groups: small-cell lung cancer
(SCLC) and non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), based on histology. Their clinical
behavior and management are different and, therefore, discussed separately.
Epidemiology

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality in the United States
with an estimated 222,520 new cases and 157,300 deaths attributable to lung cancer
in 2010.1 The incidence of lung cancer is continuing to decline in men. However, in
women the rates appear to be plateauing after several years of rising incidence.2
Risk Factors

Tobacco smoke is the major risk factor for lung cancer. There is a clear,
dose-dependent relationship between tobacco use and lung cancer. A
major public health goal in reducing total mortality from lung cancer
remains reducing the prevalence of smoking. Smoking reduction by 50%
in heavy smokers significantly reduces the risk of lung cancer.3
Squamous cell lung cancers and SCLCs, in particular, are associated with
tobacco smoking.
Other exposures have also been associated with lung cancer, including
asbestos, radon, chromium, nickel, and arsenic compounds.4 Genetic
predisposition is an important risk factor, and there are well-identified
familial clusters of lung cancers. A major inheritable lung cancer
susceptibility locus has been reported to be within 6q23–25.5 Genetic
320

polymorphisms of enzymes regulating tobacco carcinogen metabolism,
such as an exon 7 cytochrome p450 (CYP1A1) polymorphism, and GSTM1
null genotype are associated with increased risk of lung cancer.6–8 In
addition, polymorphisms of genes regulating DNA repair (ERCC2 and
XRCC1) and inflammation (COX-2, IL-6, and IL-8) have also been
reported to be associated with increased risk of lung cancer.9
Prevention and Screening

Current and former smokers have a significant risk of lung cancer, and smoking
cessation should be encouraged. Chemoprevention agents for lung cancer have not
been established. The National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) is a randomized
National Cancer Institute–sponsored trial comparing the effect of low-dose helical
computed tomography (CT) and standard chest x-ray on lung cancer mortality in
former and current smokers. According to the press release, 20% fewer lung cancer
deaths were seen among trial participants screened with low-dose helical CT.10 The
National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) does not currently recommend
screening CT use.11

NON-SMALL-CELL LUNG CANCER

GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Non-small-cell lung cancer accounts for ~87% of lung cancers in the United
States. NSCLC encompasses four pathologic subtypes:
Squamous cell lung cancer usually arises in proximal bronchi and can
cause obstruction of the larger airways.
Adenocarcinoma is the most common subtype, representing 40% of
lung cancers in North America. It usually arises in the lung periphery.
Bronchoalveolar carcinoma is a subtype of adenocarcinoma that
grows along alveolar septa. It can present as a single nodule, as multiple
nodules, or as a rapidly progressive multilobar disease that
radiographically resembles pneumonia. It is not associated with tobacco
smoking.
Large-cell carcinoma is the least common subtype.
321

DIAGNOSIS

Clinical Presentation

Presenting signs and symptoms of lung cancer depend on the size,
location, and degree of spread of the tumor. Lung cancer can present as
an asymptomatic lung nodule found incidentally on chest x-ray (CXR).
Local symptoms can include cough, wheeze, hemoptysis, dyspnea,
postobstructive pneumonia (due to tumors that occlude major bronchi),
pain (particularly with pleural or chest wall involvement), dysphagia (due
to esophageal compression by tumor or lymphadenopathy), and
hoarseness (caused by laryngeal nerve involvement). Apical tumors that
invade the lower brachial plexus can present with Pancoast syndrome,
which is a brachial plexopathy, Horner syndrome, and shoulder pain.
Mediastinal lymph-adenopathy that compresses the superior vena cava
(SVC) can cause SVC syndrome, which most commonly presents with
dyspnea and facial swelling. Systemic symptoms usually accompany
disease that is more advanced and can include weight loss, fatigue, and
loss of appetite. Metastatic disease may cause symptoms specific to the
involved organs. For example, patients may have pain from bony
metastases, dyspnea from pericardial or pleural effusions, or headache
and neurologic deficits from brain metastases. Although adrenal and liver
metastases are common, they are usually asymptomatic.
NSCLC has been associated with numerous paraneoplastic syndromes.
Clubbing results from proliferation of connective tissue at the ends of the
digits and usually improves with treatment of the tumor. Hypercalcemia
may be due to ectopic parathyroid hormone production by the tumor.
Pulmonary hypertrophic osteoarthropathy is a syndrome consisting
of bone and joint pain, clubbing, and increased alkaline phosphatase. It
can be diagnosed by plain films (which show periosteal inflammation) or
bone scan (which shows increased uptake symmetrically in long bones).
Diagnostic Testing

The goal of the initial workup is to establish the diagnosis of malignancy and to
determine accurately the clinical stage of the cancer so that candidates for
potentially curable surgical resection are identified. Strategies for obtaining a
322

pathologic diagnosis of a lung mass include sputum cytology (optimally from three
early morning sputum collections), biopsy by percutaneous fine-needle aspiration,
and bronchoscopy with biopsy.
Imaging

Once the diagnosis of NSCLC has been confirmed, recommended imaging
studies include a chest x-ray and a chest CT scan, which can reveal the size of the
tumor, extent of invasion of local structures, and presence of regional lymph node
metastases. PET scan is also useful, as it has high accuracy in detecting disease
metastatic to lymph nodes and distant sites, and it can aid in the differentiation of
benign and malignant lung nodules.
Diagnostic Procedures

Potential lymph node metastases identified on imaging studies should be
confirmed with direct biopsy. Mediastinoscopy is the most accurate means of
staging mediastinal lymph nodes and should be performed when nodal involvement
cannot be defined with chest CT. Pleural effusions should always be examined by
thoracentesis, as a tumor associated with a malignant effusion is inoperable. The
best way to identify the presence of distant metastases is with a thorough history and
physical exam. Further imaging exams (i.e., head CT, abdominal CT, bone scan)
should be directed by the patient’s symptoms and are not required in asymptomatic
patients who have early-stage tumors.
Staging

If tissue sampling confirms the diagnosis of NSCLC, the stage of disease should
be determined using the tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) staging. The 7th edition of
TNM staging was developed by the International Association for the Study of Lung
Cancer (IASLC), based on retrospective analysis of survival data from patients with
NSCLC. It was approved by the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) for
use starting January 1, 2010. See Table 19-1 for details regarding TNM staging. The
major changes in this edition include reclassification of malignant pleural effusions
as M1a rather than T4, downstaging of additional tumor nodules in a different lobe
of the same lung to T4 rather than M1. T4 tumors with separate tumor nodules in the
same lobe have been reclassified as T3. In addition, T1 and T2 tumors are divided
into additional categories (a and b) based on size cutoffs. Finally, T2 tumors larger
than 7 cm were reclassified as T3.12,13
TREATMENT
323

Stages I and II

Stage I and II tumors are considered resectable, as they have extended
no further than adjacent resectable structures or first-level lymph nodes.
The optimal treatment is surgical resection with lobectomy or
pneumonectomy. Preoperative workup includes spirometry, arterial blood
gases, and V/Q scan to establish both that the FEV1 will be > 1.2 L postresection and that the patient does not have hypercapnia or cor
pulmonale.
Patients who are not candidates for surgery because of poor lung
function or comorbid conditions should be considered for radiation
therapy (RT) administered with curative intent. Toxicities of RT include
pneumonitis (shortness of breath, tachypnea, tachycardia, fever,
nonproductive cough, and infiltrate on CXR 1 to 3 months after RT),
pulmonary fibrosis, acute esophagitis, pericarditis, and Lhermitte’s
phenomenon or radiation myelitis (transient electric sensation radiating
down the spine or into the limbs with neck flexion). Adjuvant RT is
indicated if the surgical margins are positive for tumor.

324

325

Several prospective studies have reported that the addition of adjuvant
platinum-based chemotherapy to resected stage II patients with good
performance status significantly improves survival. 14–16 In patients
with stage I patients, there is currently not enough evidence to
recommend adjuvant chemotherapy, although there is a suggestion that
stage IB tumors >4 cm in size may benefit.17,18
Stage III

Treatment of patients with stage III disease requires a multidisciplinary
approach, involving input from surgeons, medical oncologists, and radiation
oncologists. In patients with surgically resectable stage IIIA disease (T3N1), the
addition of adjuvant chemotherapy following surgical resection significantly
improves survival. 19 Patients with N2 disease are generally considered to be
unresectable. Concurrent chemotherapy and radiation has been shown to improve
long-term survival compared with sequential chemotherapy followed by radiation in
patients with unresectable IIIA and IIIB NSCLC.20 However, survival benefit was
seen only in patients with good performance status. The addition of surgery after
receiving chemoradiation in patients with stage IIIA disease (N2) has not shown a
significant survival advantage; however, a subset analysis suggested a survival
advantage in a subset of patients who underwent lobectomy, but not
pneumonectomy.21 In patients with poor performance status, a palliative treatment
approach is preferred.

326

Stage IV

Patients with stage IV disease are considered to be incurable. Recent
advances in the treatment of stage IV NSCLC include the use of targeted
agents, such as bevacizumab and erlotinib, factoring histology and
genetic mutations into treatment decisions. Front-line platinum-based
doublet chemotherapy provides modest improvement in survival.22 In
patients with non-squamous histology, treatment options include frontline platinum and pemetrexed (a folate antagonist)doublet therapy or
addition of bevacizumab, a vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)
inhibitor, to platinum-based doublet chemotherapy.23,24 Epidermal
growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) have been
studied in the front-line setting. Single-agent gefitinib, an oral EGFR-TKI,
has been shown to improve progression-free survival over combination
chemotherapy in patients with EGFR mutations, but not in patients with
EGFR wild-type tumors.25 However, neither gefitinib nor erlotinib
improved outcome when combined with cytotoxic chemotherapy.26,27
Front-line platinum-based chemotherapy is generally given for 4 to 6
cycles. Maintenance chemotherapy is an option for patients with good
performance status who do not have disease progression after 4 cycles
of front-line platinum-based doublet therapy. Agents approved for this
indication include pemetrexed and erlotinib.28,29 Selection of agent is
based on histology (pemetrexed for nonsquamous histology) and
presence of EGFR mutation (erlotinib in patients with EGFR mutations).
In patients who have had significant toxicities with first-line therapy, or
those who desire a treatment break, waiting until disease progression to
start second-line therapy is appropriate.
Single-agent docetaxel in the second-line setting has been shown to
improve survival compared to best supportive care.30 In addition,
pemetrexed is approved as a second-line agent for patients with nonsquamous histology.31 Second-line erlotinib is also approved for NSCLC.30
For patients with poor performance status, who may not benefit from
chemo-therapy, treatment should focus on palliation of symptoms. A
brief palliative course of RT may reduce disease bulk, relieving dyspnea,
pain, or other symptoms. Targeted RT may also treat pain and
complications from bony or brain metastases. Early palliative care in
patients with metastatic NSCLC integrated with standard oncologic care
327

improves quality of life.32
SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS

Somatic activating mutations in EGFR are present in 10% of unselected
NSCLC tumors. These mutations are further enriched in never smokers,
with a frequency of ~50%. Exon 19 deletions and exon 21 L858R
mutations account for 85% of EGFR mutations and are predictive for
response to EGFR-TKIs, such as erlotinib and gefitinib. The most
common mutations are exon 19 deletions and L858R mutations.
Resistance to EGFR-TKI therapy in previously responsive patients is
mediated by EGFRT90M mutations or MET amplification.
Crizotinib is an anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) inhibitor under study
in patients with advanced NSCLC carrying the EML4-ALK fusion gene.33
Patients carrying this fusion gene are typically nonsmokers and do not
have the EGFR mutation. EML4-ALK fusion gene is seen in 3% to 5% of
patients with NSCLC. There is currently no standard test for detecting the
EML4-ALK fusion gene.
MONITORING/FOLLOW-UP
According to the NCCN guidelines, in patients with no evidence of disease, a
careful history and physical exam and CT of the chest with contrast should be
performed every 4 to 6 months for 2 years. After 2 years, history, physical exam and
non-contrast CT of the chest should be performed annually.11 Patients should be
counseled regarding smoking cessation. Further tests such as PET scan, abdominal
CT, bone scan, and MRI of the brain are not part of routine surveillance and should
be obtained only if signs or symptoms suggest recurrent disease. Blood tests and
sputum cytology do not have a role in routine follow-up. Unfortunately, even with
close follow-up, it is unlikely that recurrent disease will be resectable and curable.
OUTCOME/PROGNOSIS
Prognosis varies by stage. Recurrences may be local or distant and will occur in
up to 30% of patients with stage I disease and 50% of patients with stage II disease
328

over the subsequent 5 years. The 3-year survival in patients with stage III disease
treated with chemoradiation is 25%.34 Patients with advanced stage disease treated
with platinum-based doublets have a median survival of 8 to 10 months, with a 1year survival of 30% to 40% and 2-year survival of 10% to 15%.22

SMALL-CELL LUNG CANCER

GENERAL PRINCIPLES
SCLC accounts for ~13% of lung cancers in the United States. As opposed to
NSCLC, SCLC grows more rapidly, is more often associated with diverse paraneoplastic syndromes, and is initially more chemosensitive.35
DIAGNOSIS

Clinical Presentation

The presenting signs and symptoms of SCLC are similar to those of NSCLC.
SCLCs are often centrally located and symptoms result from obstruction of the
airway lumen. Common symptoms are cough, dyspnea, hemoptysis, wheezing, and
post-obstructive pneumonia. Ten percent of patients have SVC syndrome at
presentation. Occasionally, SCLCs can present as asymptomatic lung nodules found
on imaging studies.
Paraneoplastic syndromes associated with SCLC include syndrome of
inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH), Cushing
syndrome from ectopic adrenocorticotropic hormone production, and
neurologic paraneoplastic syndromes, including peripheral neuropathy
and encephalomyelitis, are thought to be due to the production of
autoantibodies. Lambert–Eaton syndrome is caused by an autoantibody
that impairs acetylcholine release at the neuromuscular junction, leading
to proximal muscle weakness and hyporeflexia.
Diagnostic Testing

Initial workup should include a comprehensive history and physical exam. Initial
329

studies include CBC and CMP. Tumor lysis syndrome may occur with bulky
disease, so lactate dehydrogenase and uric acid should also be checked. In
addition to a baseline chest x-ray, CT scan of the chest and abdomen should be
performed to define the extent of intrathoracic disease and to detect abdominal
metastases. Further workup may include a head CT and bone scan. Once disease has
been found outside of the thorax, workup for additional sites of metastasis is not
necessary unless a metastasis requiring immediate intervention (e.g., to weightbearing bone or CNS) is suspected.
Staging

The TNM (tumor, node, metastases) staging system is not widely used to classify
SCLC, although the IASLC has proposed the use of TNM staging.36 Currently, SCLC
is described either as limited stage, with disease confined to one hemithorax that is
encompassed in a single radiation field, or as extensive stage, which describes all
other patterns of disease.
TREATMENT

Chemotherapy is the primary modality used for the treatment of SCLC,
as inferior results are obtained when RT is used alone. For patients with
limited-stage disease, combined modality treatment with
chemotherapy and RT to the chest is standard of care.37 Extensive
stage disease is treated with chemotherapy alone. The commonly used
standard chemotherapy regimens for SCLC include combinations of
carboplatin or cisplatin with etoposide. Irinotecan, topotecan, and
epirubicin are acceptable alternatives to etoposide and have a lower
incidence of myelosuppression. Overall response rate to chemotherapy is
~60%, but nearly all patients eventually have disease relapse.
Prophylactic cranial radiation (PCI) is recommended for patients with
limited-stage SCLC who achieve complete response after initial
chemoradiation to prevent intracranial metastases.38 It can also be
considered in patients with extensive-stage SCLC with a complete
response to treatment.39 However, it should not be administered to
patients with poor performance status or impaired mental function.
Patients with poor performance status or significant comorbidities may
not be able to tolerate aggressive chemotherapy. These patients may
330

receive only RT or attenuated schedules of chemotherapy, with the goal
of relieving symptoms.
MONITORING/FOLLOW-UP
Most patients treated for SCLC will relapse, usually in the first 2 years after
diagnosis. Therefore, they should have close follow-up with a medical oncologist
for the identification of symptoms, physical exam findings, or lab and CXR
abnormalities that suggest recurrent disease. According to the NCCN guidelines,
patients with no evidence of disease should have a follow-up visit every 2 to 3
months during year 1, every 3 to 4 months during years 2 to 3, and then every 4 to 6
months during years 4 to 5.40 After this, follow-up visits should be scheduled
annually. At every visit, a careful history and physical exam, labs, and CXR should
be performed. Patients should be counseled regarding smoking cessation.
OUTCOME/PROGNOSIS
Stage (limited vs. extensive), performance status, and markers of disease burden,
such as serum lactate dehydrogenase, are the factors that most reliably correlate with
outcome. The median survival of limited-stage disease treated with chemotherapy
and RT is 15 to 26 months. However, long-term survival can be achieved in 20% to
40% of patients with limited-stage SCLC with chemoradiation. The median survival
of extensive-stage disease treated with chemotherapy is 7 to 12 months. Only 5% of
patients with extensive disease survive to 2 years.
OTHER MALIGNANT TUMORS OF THE LUNG
Malignant tumors of the lung, other than NSCLC and SCLC, are uncommon and
include carcinoid tumors, mucoepidermoid carcinoma, and sarcomas. Carcinoid
tumors account for 1% of lung malignancies and are derived from neuroendocrine
cells. They arise in the bronchi and may cause bronchial obstruction and can
produce a variety of systemically active substances that cause the carcinoid
syndrome: flushing, diarrhea, and wheezing. Carcinoid tumors of the lung tend to
grow slowly and are associated with a 5-year survival of 77% to 87%.

GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Lower gastrointestinal tract tumors are the third most commonly diagnosed
cancers in the United States, and second leading cause of cancer death. Surgery
cures a high percentage of these cases (50% of all diagnosed cases). This chapter
gives an overview of colorectal and anal cancer presentation, pathophysiology,
staging, and general principles of treatment.
Epidemiology

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the fourth most frequently diagnosed cancer and the
second leading cause of cancer death in the United States. It accounts for 9% of all
cancers deaths. In the United States, the estimated number of new cases and deaths
from colorectal cancer in 2010 are 142,570 and 51,370, respectively. The overall
incidence of CRC in the United States has been declining for unclear reasons. The
current incidence of CRC is ~60.4 per 100,000 population. Incidence increases with
age, with ~90% of cases diagnosed in those >50 years old. Peak incidence occurs in
the eighth decade of life. The lifetime risk for CRC is 6% in average-risk persons
living in the United States.1
Pathophysiology

Most CRCs are thought to develop from adenomatous polyps that arise from the
colonic mucosa. Studies have shown that adenomatous polyps can become malignant
over a period of 5 to 20 years. The common histologies of a polyp are tubular,
tubulovillous, and villous. Villous adenomas are most likely to become malignant.
Other characteristic polyps to develop into malignancies are a size >1 cm in
diameter and a high grade of dysplasia. Adenomatous polyps are found in ~35% of
persons in autopsy studies. Up to 5% of polyps are believed to become malignant
336

over time. More than 95% of CRCs are adenocarcinomas. Of these, >80% are
moderately differentiated. Other histologic types seen are undifferentiated,
squamous, carcinoid, leiomyosarcomas, and lymphoid neoplasias. Poor prognosis
is associated with colloid and signet ring subtypes of adenocarcinoma, which
together represent ~20% of tumors.
Risk Factors

Risk factors for CRC are listed below.
First-degree relative with CRC
Personal history of CRC
Historyof other malignancies
History of radiation therapy to the abdomen or pelvis
Increasing age
Ureterosigmoidostomies
Inflammatory bowel disease, especially ulcerative colitis but also Crohn
disease
Family history of a CRC syndrome
Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is an autosomal dominant
disease caused by a defect in the APC gene that leads to colon cancer in
100% of patients by the age of 40 years if they are left untreated.
Affected persons will have up to thousands of adenomatous polyps with
malignant potential in their bowel. Persons with FAP should have a
prophylactic subtotal colectomy by age 30 years. Aggressive
precolectomy screening for the development of cancer is also indicated.
Other cancers such as medulloblastoma, papillary thyroid carcinoma,
hepatoblastoma, pancreatic cancer, and gastric cancer are also
associated with this syndrome.
Hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) is inherited in
an autosomal dominant manner and often leads to malignancies with
mucinous histology in the right side of the colon. Often these tumors
may arise without going through a polyp phase and, therefore, are seen
as flat adenomas. HNPCC is also associated with cancers of the
endometrium, ovary, stomach, and hepatobiliary system. Prophylactic
subtotal colectomy is also recommended for persons with HNPCC.
Other inherited syndromes associated with an increased risk of CRC
include MYH-associated polyposis, Gardner’s syndrome, Turcot’s
syndrome, Muir–Torre syndrome, and Peutz–Jeghers syndrome.
337

Prevention/Screening

Screening methods used to detect CRC include fecal occult blood testing
(FOBT), endoscopy, and barium enema. Early detection improves survival through
detection of more curable lesions, and CRC incidence is high enough that screening
can be cost-effective with an acceptable positive predictive value. Patients with
warning signs of CRC require more aggressive investigations, typically
colonoscopy.
For the asymptomatic patient:
FOBT is the least expensive and most widely used screening test for the
detection of CRC. There are problems with its sensitivity, which has been
reported to be from 25% to 80% with a specificity of >90%. Sensitivity
will be affected by polyp size and frequency of bleeding. Specificity is
affected by NSAID use, other sources of gastrointestinal bleeding,
consumption of red meat, and consumption of certain vegetables in the
diet. Hydration of samples before testing them is not recommended, as
this worsens the specificity of the test.
Flexible sigmoidoscopy examines up to 60 cm of the rectum and
distal colon and can detect ~50% of CRC cases. Its advantages are that
it can be performed in the primary care physician’s office and that it has
a specificity of nearly 100%. However, it has the disadvantage of not
assessing the entire colon, and biopsies cannot be obtained during the
procedure. Abnormalities necessitate a follow-up colonoscopy for biopsy.
Double-contrast barium enema is a radiologic method for detection
of CRC and is the safest of the visualization methods. It also requires a
bowel preparation and, like FOBT, has the disadvantage of requiring
subsequent endoscopy for biopsy of identified lesions.
Colonoscopy is considered the gold standard for detection of CRC
but is associated with a higher complication rate and a higher cost than
the other methods. It also involves more extensive preparation before
the procedure and sedation during it. For the general population after
age 50 years, National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN)
guidelines recommend colonoscopy every 10 years or annual FOBT
combined with flexible sigmoidoscopy every 5 years. If risk factors such
as a history of inflammatory bowel disease, family members with CRC, or
a known defect such as HNPCC or FAP are present, then more frequent
and earlier testing is recommended. For patients with a familial history
of colorectal cancer, screening begins 10 years before the age of cancer
338

diagnosis of the affected family member.
DIAGNOSIS
Colonoscopy with biopsy is the diagnostic procedure of choice and is potentially
curative for benign polyps and carcinoma in situ. Diagnosis depends on tissue
pathology consistent with invasive colon cancer.
Clinical Presentation
History

CRC may present with symptoms such as fatigue, anorexia, failure to
thrive, lower gastrointestinal bleeding, and right upper quadrant pain
associated with liver metastasis, although it is often asymptomatic until
the tumor is large in size. Patients may also present due to a positive
screen test.
Symptoms associated with CRC are often related to the location of the
tumor within the bowel. Therefore, right-sided lesions often present
with symptoms of anemia and, occasionally, of melena. Left-sided
lesions commonly cause obstruction, tenesmus, constipation, bright-red
blood per rectum, and other changes in bowel habits. Patients often
have an iron-deficiency anemia and may have symptoms of pica.
Because CRC is a cause of anemia, it is important to evaluate any person
who presents with unexplained anemia for CRC, especially men and
postmenopausal women.
CRC most often metastasizes to the liver, lung, adrenals, ovaries, and
bone, so symptoms of organ compromise such as abdominal discomfort,
shortness of breath, and bone pain may be present in metastatic
disease.
Physical Exam

Signs of CRC on physical exam include gross blood or melanotic stool in the
rectal vault, pallor in the conjunctivae and the nail beds, or a palpable mass in the
abdomen or the rectum. If liver metastases are present, patients may have
hepatomegaly and be tender to palpation in the right upper quadrant. On barium
enema, an apple core lesion may be seen, which suggests colon cancer. Bacteremia
or endocarditis with Streptococcus bovis is also a sign of CRC, and these findings
339

should trigger an evaluation for colon cancer.
Diagnostic Testing
Laboratories

CBC to evaluate for associated iron-deficiency anemia
Chemistry and liver function tests to evaluate for liver involvement
Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA): if initially elevated, then a rise in CEA
after treatment may indicate a recurrence
Imaging Studies

Chest/abdomen/pelvis CT scan to rule out metastasis
Diagnostic Procedures

All patients should have the entire colon evaluated by colonoscopy or
barium enema to rule out synchronous lesions. Up to 5% of patients
have another focus of CRC in their bowels. Patients should have a tissue
biopsy before therapy to confirm the diagnosis.
Staging

Surgery is important for accurate staging of CRC. The preferred staging
system for CRC is the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) TNM
(tumor, node, metastases) system (Table 20-1). TNM uses the degree of
tumor invasion, the presence of positive lymph nodes, and the presence
of distant metastasis to classify the disease in one of four stages.
Although the AJCC TNM staging system is the preferred staging system
today, the Duke staging system with the Astler–Coller modification is
often referred to in older literature (Table 20-2).

TREATMENT
The goals of therapy need to be clearly delineated from the beginning and
reevaluated throughout the patient’s course. Colon cancer that has not metastasized is
a curable disease with surgery. Chemotherapy can be added to improve cure rates
for stage II or III tumors or as palliation for incurable tumors (Table 20-3).
Surgery is undertaken with intent to cure in 75% of those with colon
cancer. Many of the remainder will require surgery to prevent
obstruction, perforation, or bleeding. Wide excision of the tumor with a
distal margin of ~5 cm is recommended for curative surgery. The length
of colon and mesentery resected is determined by vascular anatomy. If
the tumor is adherent to or invades another organ, an en bloc excision
must be done to prevent seeding to allow for the possibility of cure. If
the surgical intent is palliation instead of cure, a simple resection or
342

diversion is used to lessen morbidity from the procedure. In stage IV
cancer, some patients may benefit from resection of metastases. Fiveyear survival rates of up to 40% have been obtained with resection of
limited liver metastases.3

Adjuvant chemotherapy is administered to patients who have
undergone potentially curative resection of colon cancer. The goal of
adjuvant therapy is to eradicate micrometastases, thereby reducing the
likelihood of disease recurrence. 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU), leucovorin, and
oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) is preferred but may consider 5-FU with leucovorin
or capecitabine for patients who cannot tolerate oxaliplatin after
resection of stage III colon cancer. Capecitabine is an oral prodrug that
is converted to 5-FU in tumor tissues. Adjuvant chemotherapy has
demonstrated approximately a 30% reduction in the risk of disease
recurrence and 10% reduction in mortality. However, controversy
remains over adjuvant chemotherapy for stage II disease. Because there
seems to be only a small benefit from treating stage II colon cancer,
chemotherapy should be considered for high-risk disease, including those
patients who present with a total obstruction, T4 tumors (stage IIB),
perforation, poor histological grade, lymphovascular invasion, or positive
surgical margins and inadequately sampled nodes (<12 lymph nodes).4–9
In patients with stage II disease, a deficiency in MMR (mismatch repair)
protein expression or high levels of microsatellite instability protein (MSIH) are markers of a more favorable outcome with decreased benefit
(possibly detrimental impact) from adjuvant therapy with 5-FU alone. 10
Palliative treatment for metastatic disease depends on the functional
status of the patient. It typically involves 5-FU with leucovorin,
capecitabine alone, or 5-FU and leucovorin in combination with either the
topoisomerase I inhibitor irinotecan (the FOLFIRI regimen) or oxaliplatin
343

(the FOLFOX regimen).11–16 Both of the combination regimens have
improved efficacy by the addition of the vascular endothelial growth
factor antibody, bevacizumab (Avastin)17,18 or endothelial growth factor
receptor inhibitory antibodies, cetuximab (Erbitux), or panitumumab
(Vectibix) in patients with K-Ras wild-type gene. After disease
progression, patients are usually switched to another one of the primary
regimens and may also receive either of the endothelial growth factor
receptor inhibitory antibodies, cetuximab (Erbitux), or panitumumab
(Vectibix)19–21 if the tumors are K-Ras wild type. Patients with stage IV
disease should be referred for clinical trials when possible.
Treatment of Rectal Cancer

Surgery is used in rectal cancer to cure the disease, and it also plays a
role in palliative therapy. The most important feature of the rectum is
the lack of a serosa for these tumors. Because of this anatomy, local
recurrence for rectal cancer is high, and neoadjuvant therapy may be
needed to make a tumor resectable. Accordingly, surgery is used in
conjunction with radiation or chemoradiation,22–24 and this multimodality
approach has been associated with decreased recurrence. Approaches
aimed at sphincter preservation, obviating the need for colostomy, can
often be performed if a 2-cm margin can be obtained.
Compared to colon cancer, rectal cancer is much more likely to recur
locally than distally. Adjuvant chemoradiation is therefore tailored to
prevent local recurrence in stage II and III cancers. 22,23 Currently, stage
II rectal cancer is treated with surgery along with FOLFOX, 5-FU, or
capecitabine and radiation, leading to significant improvements in overall
survival compared to treatment with surgery alone. 25,26 For stage III
tumors, part of the systemic chemotherapy and radiation therapy may be
given before surgery to increase resectability.24–26
COMPLICATIONS

Tumor Related

Complications that can result from CRC include bowel obstruction, anemia, and
344

abdominal pain. More serious complications can include peritonitis after
perforation, fistula formation, and malnutrition. Complications can also result from
sites of metastatic disease. Liver metastases can lead to hyperbilirubinemia and
coagulopathies. Pulmonary metastases, when advanced, may result in cough or
shortness of breath. Patients may also develop pain at sites of metastases.
Treatment Related

Complications of treatment are commonly related to surgery and chemotherapy
but can also occur with radiation therapy. Postoperative mortality rates are 1% to
5%. Major morbidity includes bowel and bladder dysfunction, sexual dysfunction,
anastomotic leaks, and bowel obstruction. The need for a permanent colostomy can
be psychologically upsetting. Chemotherapy complications may include neuropathy
(possibly long term), nausea, diarrhea, and hand-foot syndrome. Radiation may
cause local radiation dermatitis with pain, desquamation, and color changes.
MONITORING/FOLLOW-UP
Current recommendations are for a history, physical, and CEA every 3 months
for 2 years, and then every 6 months for another 3 years. At 1 year, a colonoscopy
should be performed to look for local recurrence and synchronous disease. If the
colonoscopy is negative, then it should be repeated in 3 years and then every 5
years. If the patient had a high-grade tumor or lymphovascular invasion, then a CT of
the chest, abdomen, and pelvis should be repeated annually for the first 3 years to
monitor for metastatic spread.
OUTCOMES/PROGNOSIS
Stage has great significance in the prognosis and treatment of the disease. In the
United States between 1996 and 2002, the overall 5-year survival rate for patients
with CRC was 65.1%. The 5-year survival for stages I/II, III, and IV was 90.4%,
68.1%, and 9.8%, respectively. Other prognostic factors include the number of
positive lymph nodes and if the tumor invasion was through the bowel wall into
adjacent organs or into veins.

ANAL CANCER

345

GENERAL PRINCIPLES

Epidemiology

Anal cancer accounts for ~1.6% of all alimentary malignancies in the United
States. Its incidence generally increases with age, with the peak incidence in the
sixth and seventh decades of life. The incidence is increasing in men <40 years old
due to increased risk in the HIV+ population. Histologically, 63% of anal cancers
are squamous cell carcinomas. Basaloid transitional cell carcinomas (cloacogenic)
make up 23% of cases. More rare types of anal cancers are adenocarcinoma, basal
cell carcinoma, and melanoma.
Risk Factors

The risk factor most commonly associated with anal cancer is human
papilloma virus (HPV) infection particularly with serotypes 16 and 18.
In women, increased anal cancers are seen with HPV-associated cervical
cancer. In men, anal cancer is more frequently associated with receptive
anal intercourse and HPV. As many as 70% of anal cancers are positive
for HPV.
Other risk factors include immunosuppression, such as that seen after
renal transplant or HIV infection. Current cigarette smoking is also a risk
factor for anal cancer, with a relative risk of seven- to ninefold for
smokers.
DIAGNOSIS

Clinical Presentation
History

Anal cancers present with bleeding 50% of the time. Other symptoms include
pain, mass, constipation, diarrhea, and pruritus. Often the symptoms are ascribed to
hemorrhoids, which may delay diagnosis. Approximately 25% of people are
asymptomatic when the cancer is discovered.
Physical Exam

346

Physical exam findings include an anal mass and lymphadenopathy. On
palpation, an anal mass will often be firm and indurated. Anoscopy, proctoscopy,
and transrectal ultrasonography are used to visualize the mass. Diagnosis is made by
incisional biopsy of the mass and any suspicious inguinal lymphadenopathy.
Diagnostic Testing

Procedures

Digital rectal exam and inguinal lymph node exam should be accompanied by
anoscopy. Notes should be made of the location of the mass, including its position
relative to the dentate line. Anal cancers are divided into those of the anal margin
and those of the anal canal. The line of demarcation is a zone approximately halfway
between the dentate line and the anal verge. Women should have a pelvic exam for
cervical cancer screening due to the association with HPV. Men and women should
be tested for HIV, especially if any risk factors are present.

347

Imaging

Imaging may include chest x-ray or chest CT, abdominal/pelvic CT or MRI, and
possible PET scan to rule out metastatic disease.
Staging

Staging is based on the TNM system (Table 20-4).
TREATMENT
Very small tumors at the anal margin may be treated with wide local excision.
Larger (T2-T4) and node positive cancers should be treated similar to anal canal
carcinomas with concurrent chemoradiation (5-FU and Mitomycin). 27,28 In several
trials, 5-year survival varied between 64% and 83% with combined-modality
therapy. After treatment, close medical follow-up is needed to screen for recurrence.
Recurrences may be treated surgically if resectable, or if unresectable consider
cisplatin-based chemotherapy or clinical trial.
OUTCOME/PROGNOSIS
Prognosis is related to the size of the primary tumor and the presence of lymph
node metastases.
The 5-year survival rate for patients with tumors that are treated with
chemoradiation and that are ≤2 cm is 80%, whereas if they are ≥5 cm it is less than
50%.29,30 Tumors in the anal margin have a more favorable prognosis than those in
the canal.

ESOPHAGEAL CANCER

GENERAL PRINCIPLES

Definition

Primary carcinoma that arises from the cricopharyngeal sphincter to the
gastroesophageal junction
Classification

Site: divided into upper, middle, and lower third.
Histology: most commonly adenocarcinoma (occurs predominantly at
lower third of esophagus) and squamous cell carcinoma (occurs
predominantly at middle and upper third); other less common types
include mucoepidermoid carcinoma, small-cell carcinoma, sarcoma,
leiomyosarcoma, and primary lymphoma.
Epidemiology

The incidence in the United States is ~5 per 100,000, although in African
American men it may be as high as 18 per 100,000. China and Iran have
an incidence of 20 per 100,000.
In the United States, 16,640 new cases and 14,500 deaths from this
352

cancer were estimated in 2010. It is the seventh leading cause of cancer
death in men.
Age: 6th to 7th decades.
Sex: M:F, 3 to 4:1.
Race: in the United States, esophageal adenocarcinomas are more
common in white males, whereas squamous cell carcinomas are more
common in African Americans.
Socioeconomic status: Lower socioeconomic status as defined by
income, occupation, and education are associated with higher risk for
squamous cell carcinoma.
Histology: in the United States, squamous cell carcinoma used to be the
more prominent type until the early 1990s when it was surpassed by
adenocarcinoma. Such shift is believed to be due to increased incidence
of GERD, Barrett’s esophagus, and obesity.
Etiology and Pathophysiology

The exact etiology of esophageal carcinoma remains unclear but likely is
an evolution of oncogenic changes within the esophageal epithelium
following chronic exposure to known carcinogens or chronic irritation by
gastric acid in patients with GERD. Conversely, patients with chronic
atrophic gastritis caused by cagA-positive Helicobacter pylori are
associated with decreased risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma.
Risk Factors

Alcohol, tobacco, nitrosamines, GERD, Barrett’s esophagus, obesity,
Plummer– Vinson syndrome, history of head and neck cancer
High-fat, low-calorie, and low-protein diet
Prevention

Cessation from smoking and alcohol consumption
Raw fruits and vegetables, fibers, selenium, as well as vitamins A, C, and
E
Associated Conditions

Barrett’s esophagus (30- to 125-fold increased risk of developing
adenocarcinoma), Howel–Evans syndrome
353

DIAGNOSIS

Clinical Presentation
History

Due to the lack of initial symptoms, most cases are diagnosed at
advanced stage. Typical presenting symptoms are dysphagia (95%),
which typically progressed from solid to liquid, body weight loss (50%),
odynophagia (20%), and gastric reflux (40%). Extraesophageal spread
can cause pain, cough (20%), hoarseness (secondary to recurrent
laryngeal nerve involvement), aspiration, tracheal narrowing, or
tracheoesophageal fistula.
Physical Examination

Most patients lack obvious physical findings, but cervical or
supraclavicular adenopathy may be appreciated in patients with nodal
metastasis.
Diagnostic Criteria

Histopathologic diagnosis from endoscopic biopsy and/or transcutaneous
lymph node biopsy (if applicable) is required.
Differential Diagnosis

Barrett’s esophagus, esophageal stricture, achalasia, gastric cancer
Diagnostic Testing
Laboratories

Complete blood count (CBC), comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP),
prothrombin time (PT), partial thromboplastin time (PTT), and iron
studies
Initial Diagnostic Test

Upper endoscopy with directed biopsy is the current gold standard.
354

Barium studies may show strictures or intraluminal lesions, but they are
less sensitive and do not allow for biopsy.
Imaging Studies

Once the diagnosis is established, an initial CT scan of chest,
abdomen with IV and oral contrast should be obtained to assess
extent of primary disease, nodal and distant organ metastasis.
Bone scan is indicated in patients with bone pain or elevated alkaline
phosphatase.
If no distant metastasis is seen from the initial CT scan, more sensitive
diagnostic tests should be performed to provide more accurate staging. A
positron emission tomography (PET) or PET-CT scan (preferred by the
NCCN guideline) should be obtained. They have a higher sensitivity and
specificity than conventional CT scan in detecting nodal and distant
metastasis. In many medical centers, this PET scan has become part of
the standard preoperative workup. If indicated, FDG-avid lymph nodes
should be biopsied to confirm metastasis.
Diagnostic Procedures

Once distant metastasis is excluded by PET scan, an endoscopic
ultrasonography (EUS) should be performed. This procedure allows
the most precise assessment of tumor depth, length of esophagus
affected, and magnitude of lymph node metastases, particularly
paraesophageal and celiac nodes. A fine-needle aspiration of suspicious
lymph nodes can be done during the study.
Patients presenting with cough, symptoms or radiographic evidence of
aspiration pneumonia, tumor abutting/invading the trachea at or above
carina should receive bronchoscopy to assess tracheal invasion or
tracheoesophageal fistula.
TREATMENT
Treatment is based on TNM stage (Table 21-1):
Stage 0. Endoscopic mucosal resection followed by periodic surveillance
Stage I.
Esophagectomy if patients are medically fit, with esophageal carcinoma
355

at mid or lower third esophagus, or if they have adenocarcinoma.
Concurrent chemoradiation is preferred for cancer in the upper third
esophagus and is an alternative for patients who are not surgical
candidates.
Stage II, III, or Iva.
Esophagectomy with regional lymphadenectomy is the main treatment,
but is inadequate.
Neoadjuvant therapies with chemotherapy, radiation, or in combination
have been studied, and conflicting results have been obtained.1 Current
NCCN guidelines support the use of neoadjuvant chemoradiation in
medically fit patients. Patients with adenocarcinoma of distal esophagus
or gastroesophageal junction should receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy
(epirubicin, cisplatin, and 5-FU) before esophagectomy.
Adjuvant chemoradiotherapy clearly has a role in the treatment of
esophageal cancer. The most common regimen is cisplatin plus 5-FU
with daily irradiation.
Patients with gross (R2 resection) or microscopic (R1 resection) residual
disease following surgery should receive combined chemoradiation.
Adjuvant chemoradiotherapy in patients without residual disease (R0
resection) is less defined. In the current NCCN guidelines, observation is
recommended for those with squamous cell carcinoma. Patients with
adenocarcinoma, lymph node–positive disease, or large tumors (≥T3)
should receive chemoradiotherapy.
Patients with localized unresectable disease or who are medically unfit
for surgery should be considered for definitive chemoradiation consisting
of cisplatin, 5-FU, plus daily irradiation. 2

356

Stage IVb. Metastatic esophageal cancer is incurable with a median
survival of 9 months. Several chemotherapeutic agents including
cisplatin, carboplatin, 5-FU, paclitaxel, docetaxel, vinorelbine, oxaliplatin,
and irinotecan are commonly used.
In general, platinum-based doublets have the highest response rate and
are typically used as first-line therapy.
Addition of cetuximab to platinum-based doublets can be considered in
patients with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-overexpressing
tumor.
Targeted therapies such as erlotinib and gefitinib as second-line
357

monotherapy have been shown to offer some benefit to a small number
of patients and can be considered for patients who cannot tolerate
cytotoxic chemotherapy.
Other Non-Pharmacologic Therapies

Palliative care in swallowing and nutritional support is especially
important. This includes esophageal dilation, stent placement,
brachytherapy, external-beam radiation, and laser therapy. Patients with
metastatic esophageal cancer frequently require a gastrostomy tube.
Lifestyle/Risk Modification

All patients should be encouraged to cease smoking and consuming
alcohol. Patients with gastroesophageal reflux should be managed by
dietary modification, exercise, and, if necessary, treated medically with
H2-blockers or proton pump inhibitors.
Diet

Increase consumption of fresh fruits and vegetables and dietary fibers,
and abstain from alcohol and high-fat diet.
Activity

Overweight or obese patients should be encouraged to exercise and lose
weight.
COMPLICATIONS

Hemorrhage, obstruction, tracheoesophageal fistula, aspiration
pneumonia, and mediastinitis.
REFERRAL

Nutritional consult should be obtained for all patients undergoing
treatment of esophageal cancer.
MONITORING/FOLLOW-UP
358

Patients with Barrett’s metaplasia should receive surveillance endoscopy
at least every 12 months with biopsy taken.
After definitive treatment, asymptomatic patients should typically be
evaluated by history and physical examination every 3 months for 2
years, and then every 6 months for 3 additional years. CBC and CMP
should be obtained during each routine follow-up, and imaging studies
such as CT scan should be obtained at least every 6 months in the first 1
to 3 years or when clinically indicated.
OUTCOME/PROGNOSIS

The most important prognostic factor is initial staging; others include
age, performance status, and weight loss (>10%). Neither histology nor
grade has been shown to affect prognosis. Molecular profiling of tumor
cells is an area of active investigation.
Five-year survival rates are >90% (stage 0), 70% to 80% (stage I),
10% to 30% (stage II), 5% to 10% (stage III), and rare in stage IV
disease.

GASTRIC CANCER

GENERAL PRINCIPLES

Definition

Cancer that arises between the gastroesophageal junction and pylorus
Classification

Histology:
Adenocarcinoma (95%), primary lymphoma such as non-Hodgkin’s
lymphoma, MALToma, GI stromal tumor (GIST), leiomyosarcoma,
squamous cell carcinoma, small cell carcinoma, and carcinoid
359

Lauren classification of gastric adenocarcinoma:
Intestinal type: more common in Japan, associated with diet and
possibly H. pylori infection
Diffuse type: more common in the United States, not associated with
diet, associated with poorer outcome
Mixed type
Borrmann classification of gastric adenocarcinoma:
Type 1 (polypoid), II (ulcerated), III (ulcerated infiltrating), IV (diffusely
infiltrating or linitis plastica)
Epidemiology

Gastric cancer is a relatively less common cancer in the United States
but much more common in eastern Asia, especially Japan. It is the
second most common cause of cancer deaths in the world.
In the United States, 21,000 new cases and 10,570 deaths from this
cancer were estimated in 2010. Incidence and mortality of gastric cancer
have been declining in the United States.
Age: 7th decade.
Sex: M:F, 2 to 3:1.
Race: slightly more frequent in African American than Caucasian.
Etiology and Pathophysiology

Oncogenic mutation of K-Ras and H-Ras, overexpression of Her2/neu
and c-met, and loss of p53 are among the common genetic changes
found in gastric adenocarcinoma.
C-kit (90% to 95%) or PDGFR (5%) mutations are found in most GISTs.
MALT lymphomas are frequently associated with H. pylori infection and
can be cured with antibiotics alone.
Risk Factors

History of atrophic gastritis or pernicious anemia, cigarette smoking,
alcohol, H. pylori infection, chronic gastric ulcer, Barrett’s esophagitis,
high salt, nitrate intake, smoked or pickled food, family history of gastric
cancer.
Patients with germline E-cadherin (CDH1 gene) mutation are at
extremely high risk of developing gastric cancer at young age.
360

Prevention

Because H. pylori infection is associated with 40% to 50% of gastric
adenocarcinomas, it should be actively eradicated when
diagnosed. Patients diagnosed with gastric ulcer should undergo repeat
endoscopic surveillance in 3 to 6 months.
DIAGNOSIS

Clinical Presentation
History

Most gastric carcinomas are diagnosed at an advanced stage due to the
lack of early warning symptoms. Most patients present with nonspecific
constitutional symptoms such as weight loss (~80%), anorexia, fatigue,
vague stomach pain, hematemesis (~15%), dysphagia (from
gastroesophageal junction tumors), and vomiting (from gastric outlet
obstruction).
Patients with GIST typically present with bleeding such as hematemesis,
tarry stools or melena, epigastric pain, and nausea.
Physical Examination

The physical findings in gastric carcinoma are typically manifestations of
metastatic disease. Virchow node describes metastasis to the left
supraclavicular node. Sister Mary Joseph node is a periumbilical
lymph node metastasis. A Krukenberg tumor is a gastric cancer
metastatic to the ovaries. Blumer shelf describes a “drop metastasis”
into the perirectal pouch. Other common physical findings in patients
with metastatic gastric cancer include cachexia, palpable abdominal
masses, and malignant ascites.
Diagnostic Criteria

Histopathologic diagnosis from endoscopic biopsy and/or transcutaneous
lymph node biopsy (if applicable) is required.
In the case of GIST, tumor size and mitotic index are important factors in
361

risk stratification.
Differential Diagnosis

Gastric ulcer, gastritis, non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, GIST, esophageal
cancer
Diagnostic Testing
Laboratories

CBC, CMP, PT, PTT, CEA, and iron studies
Initial Diagnostic Test

Upper endoscopy with directed biopsy is the current gold standard.
Barium studies with double contrast provide information on size of
ulcerated lesion and gastric motility but are less sensitive and do not
allow for biopsy.
Imaging

CT scans or PET/CT is frequently used to evaluate for extent of disease.
Diagnostic Procedures

In the absence of metastasis by CT, endoscopic ultrasound can be used
to gauge tumor depth and involvement of local lymph nodes.
Metastatic peritoneal deposits may not be seen on routine imaging, and
a diagnostic laparoscopy is necessary to rule this out before definitive
resection.
TREATMENT
For gastric adenocarcinoma, treatment is based on TNM stage (Table 21-2):
Stage 0 and Ia. Endoscopic mucosal resection
Stage Ib. Subtotal gastrectomy if at distal stomach, otherwise total
gastrectomy with at least D1 resection
Stage II to IV, but without distant metastasis.
For potentially resectable disease, either perioperative chemotherapy
(such as ECF) for three cycles before and after total gastrectomy or
362

adjuvant 5-FU-based chemoradiation can be considered.3,4
For medically unfit or unresectable localized gastric adenocarcinoma, 5FU-based chemoradiation (45 to 50 cGy) is the standard of care. Only a
very small percentage of patients can be cured with chemoradiation
alone.
Metastatic disease. Incurable with median survival of 9 months.
Chemotherapy offers improved life quality and survival. No clear
standard of care first-line regimen exists, but commonly used regimens
are ECF, DCF, EOX, EOF, ECF, FOLFIRI, and CF. Addition of trastuzumab
to chemotherapy improves median survival in patients with Her2-positive
gastric cancer.5
For GIST

Surgical resection is the treatment of choice. Adjuvant imatinib for 1 year
is recommended by the NCCN for patients with intermediate or high risk
(based on tumor size and mitotic index).
For advanced or metastatic GIST, imatinib should be used until disease
progression. 6 Upon progression, increased imatinib dosage or switching
to sunitinib can be considered.
SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS

Given the rarity of gastric cancer in the United States, there is no
justification for routine screening for esophageal or stomach cancer at
this time. However, in countries of high incidence (e.g., Japan),
screening for stomach cancer via endoscopy or upper gastrointestinal
imaging is standard for those >50 years old.

363

COMPLICATIONS

Include hemorrhage, gastric obstruction, and malignant ascites.
Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is a rare complication that
may occur in patients with advanced gastric carcinoma and bone marrow
metastasis. Mortality is high at 1 to 4 weeks of onset and requires
aggressive supportive management and, if possible, chemotherapy.
Patients who underwent total gastrectomy often develop dumping
364

syndrome, vitamin B12 deficiency, and reflux esophagitis.
MONITORING/FOLLOW-UP

After definitive treatment, asymptomatic patients should typically be
evaluated by history and physical examination every 3 months for 2
years, and then every 6 months for 3 additional years. CBC, CMP, and, if
applicable, CEA should be obtained during each routine follow-up, and
imaging studies such as CT scan should be obtained at least every 6
months in the first 1 to 3 years or when clinically indicated.
OUTCOME/PROGNOSIS

Five-year survival rates are stage I 60% to 80%, stage II 20% to 40%,
and stage III 10% to 20%.

PANCREATIC CANCER

GENERAL PRINCIPLES

Definition

Cancer that arises from either the exocrine or the endocrine tissue of the
pancreas
Classification

Site: Two-thirds of the cases originate from pancreatic head.
Histology: 95% of pancreatic cancers are exocrine ductal carcinoma,
with the rest being acinar carcinoma or neuroendocrine tumors.
Epidemiology

Pancreatic cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer death in the
365

United States, with an annual incidence of ~12.3/100,000.
Up to 43,140 new cases and 36,800 deaths were anticipated in 2010.
Age: 6th to 7th decades.
Sex: slightly higher in males.
Race: higher in African Americans.
Etiology and Pathophysiology

Activation mutation of K-Ras and loss of tumor suppressor INK4a are
found in >90% of pancreatic cancer. Recently, activation of Sonic
hedgehog signaling pathway has been shown to be important in
oncogenesis of pancreatic cancer.
Chronic inflammation is believed to accelerate mutagenesis and cancer
formation.
Risk Factors

Cigarette smoking, positive family history, chronic pancreatitis, obesity,
diabetes mellitus
Associated Conditions

Lynch syndrome, ataxia-telangiectasia, BRCA2 mutation, familial atypical
mole melanoma syndrome, Peutz–Jeghers syndrome, HNPCC.
DIAGNOSIS

Clinical Presentation
History

Most patients are asymptomatic until advanced stage. Presenting
symptoms may include abdominal or back pain, weight loss, nausea,
vomiting, painless jaundice, fatigue, and depression.
Physical Examination

Palpable abdominal mass, jaundice, ascites, Courvoisier sign (painless
palpable gallbladder), Virchow node, and Sister Mary Joseph node may
366

occasionally be found.
Paraneoplastic syndromes, such as Trousseau syndrome (migratory
superficial phlebitis), idiopathic deep venous thrombosis, myositis
syndromes, and Cushing syndrome, are rarely seen.
Diagnostic Testing
Laboratories

CBC, CMP, PT, and PTT
CEA, CA19–9 levels should be obtained as a baseline and followed for
response/recurrence.
Imaging

Initial imaging studies are usually abdominal CT scan or
ultrasonography.
Dynamic-phase spiral CT of the abdomen (“pancreatic protocol”) is
the current most accurate imaging modality in assessing pancreatic
tumor. It allows detailed evaluation of the pancreas, extent of local
invasion, and common sites of metastasis such as peripancreatic lymph
nodes and the liver.
Patients with confirmed pancreatic cancer should complete staging
workup with chest and pelvic CT scan.
Diagnostic Procedures

Further tumor staging with an endoscopic ultrasound or endoscopic
retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) may be necessary.
Tissue diagnosis can be obtained by percutaneous ultrasound or CTguided-needle biopsy, laparoscopy, ERCP, or ascitic fluid cytology.
Staging can be done by TNM system (Table 21-3), or more commonly by
resectability (localized/resectable, borderline resectable, locally
advanced/unresectable and metastatic stages).

367

TREATMENT

In the absence of metastatic disease, surgical consult should always be
obtained to assess resectability, which is the basis for subsequent
management.
Localized, resectable disease
The standard procedure is a pancreaticoduodenectomy with
choledochojejunostomy, cholecystectomy, and gastrojejunostomy
368

(Whipple procedure). Surgical mortality is 1% to 4% even at high
volume centers.
Adjuvant therapy is necessary after resection of the primary, since close
to 80% of these patients later develop locoregional recurrence or distant
metastases. Patients should be enrolled in clinical trials if available.
Commonly used regimens include concurrent chemoradiation with 5-FU
or gemcitabine, or gemcitabine followed by 5-FU-based chemoradiation.
Borderline resectable disease
This new category was introduced in 2009 and is defined by certain
radio-graphic features in which upfront surgery is likely to result in
positive surgical margin.
Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (5-FU or gemcitabine) with or without
radiation have been proposed with hopes to downstage the tumor and
improve the likelihood of complete resection, to exclude patients with
rapidly progressive disease who may not benefit from surgery, and to
avoid delay in chemoradiation due to prolonged postoperative recovery.
While this approach is gaining popularity, its benefit has not been
convincingly shown by large randomized-control studies.
Locally advanced disease
5-FU or gemcitabine-based concurrent chemoradiation is the standard
therapy and yields comparable results. A minority of patients can
become resectable using this approach.
Metastatic pancreatic cancer.
Metastatic pancreatic cancer is incurable. Chemotherapy has a low
objective response rate (6% to 12%) but has been shown to improve
quality of life and overall survival.
Clinical trials should be recommended if available.
Current recommended first-line chemotherapy is gemcitabine-based
regimens. Gemcitabine plus erlotinib showed a marginal survival benefit
over gemcitabine alone, but at the expense of more toxicity. 7
Combinations with other agents such as capecitabine, pemetrexed,
irinotecan, cisplatin, cetuximab, or bevacizumab did not show additional
benefit than gemcitabine alone. The combination of drugs in the
FOLFIRINOX regiment does increase survival over gemcitabine alone.
Second-line chemotherapies include capecitabine and 5-FU/oxaliplatin.
Lifestyle/Risk Modification

369

All patients should be encouraged to cease smoking and consuming
alcohol.
Diet

Most patients undergoing treatment suffer from pancreatic insufficiency
and, therefore, should be prescribed pancreatic enzymes and told to
avoid high-fat diet.
SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS

Routine preoperative biliary stenting for obstructive jaundice
secondary to localized pancreatic head cancer was recently shown to be
associated with higher postoperative complications compared to patients
who received early surgery. Therefore, discussion should be made
between hepatobiliary surgeon and gastroenterologist before stenting.
COMPLICATIONS

Pain management is paramount in pancreatic cancer patients. In
addition to standard analgesics, celiac plexus block may be an option in
selected patients.
Biliary obstruction and subsequent cholangitis should be relieved
by stenting or draining procedures.
Patients who undergo Whipple procedure will develop diabetes.
MONITORING/FOLLOW-UP

After definitive treatment, asymptomatic patients should typically be
evaluated by history and physical examination every 3 months for 2
years, and then every 6 months for 3 additional years. CBC, CMP, and, if
applicable, CA19–9 or CEA and CT scan of chest/abdomen/pelvis should
be obtained during each routine follow-up.
OUTCOME/PROGNOSIS

370

Overall 5-year survival is 5%. Upon diagnosis, >50% of cases were
metastatic, 25% locally advanced, and <20% were potentially
resectable.
Most important prognostic factors include surgical margin, lymph node
status, and tumor size. However, even patients who underwent curative
resection have a 15% to 20% 5-year survival rate.
Median survival for unresectable disease has been as short as 6 months,
but many trials are now reporting median survivals of treated patients
closer to 12 months.

HEPATOCELLULAR CARCINOMA

GENERAL PRINCIPLES

Definition

Primary cancer that arises from hepatocytes
Epidemiology

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most common cancer
worldwide, but it is rare in the United States. The incidence in the United
States is around 5 per 100,000, but this has been rising over the last few
decades due to the increase in hepatitis B and C infections.
Age: 7th decade.
Sex: M:F, 3:1.
Race: higher incidence in African Americans and Asians.
Etiology and Pathophysiology

Chronic inflammation, necrosis, and liver regeneration likely predispose
hepatocytes to acquire mutations.
Integration of HBV DNA into hepatocyte genome can contribute to
cancer formation.

371

Risk Factors

Hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and cirrhosis from any cause such as alcohol and
nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, alpha1-antitypsin deficiency,
hemochromatosis
Prevention

Vaccination against hepatitis B.
Treatment of chronic hepatitis B with lamivudine has been shown to
decrease the risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
Treatment of hepatitis C with interferon may decrease the subsequent
risk of hepatocellular carcinoma. Patients with hepatitis C should be
screened with annual alpha-fetoprotein levels and liver ultrasound.
Retinoids may have a role in secondary prevention of HCC.
Associated Conditions

Twenty percent to 30% of patients with chronic hepatitis C eventually
develop cirrhosis. Cirrhotic patients have 2% to 6% per year risk of
developing hepato-cellular carcinoma.
DIAGNOSIS

Clinical Presentation
History

Patients may have nonspecific complaints of abdominal pain, malaise,
weight loss, or fever. Most patients have history of liver cirrhosis.
Physical Examination

Patients may occasionally have a palpable liver mass. Most patients
have physical findings of cirrhosis, such as ascites, splenomegaly,
spider angiomata, and collateral circulation muscle wasting.
Diagnostic Criteria

372

Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level of >200 ng/mL (in absence of chronic
hepatitis B) or >400 ng/mL (in chronic hepatitis B), and presence of
hepatic mass >2 cm with classic arterial enhancement by CT scan or
MRA, is adequate for diagnosis.
Percutaneous needle biopsy (FNA or core biopsy) should be
performed in uncertain cases (low AFP, small liver lesion or without
vascular enhancement).
Differential Diagnosis

Adenoma, hemangioma, metastatic cancer
Diagnostic Testing
Laboratories

CBC, CMP, PT, PTT, and AFP (elevated in 85% cases)
Imaging studies

Abdominal ultrasound or CT scan with contrast is usually done
initially.
If primary hepatocellular cancer is strongly suspected, more detailed
imaging studies including triple-phase contrast enhanced CT scan
or MRI are used to define anatomic relationships and vascular anatomy.
Conventional angiography, CT or MR-angiography is usually needed to
completely reveal the anatomy and characteristics of the tumor
vasculature.
TREATMENT

Many staging systems have been proposed, which include the Okuda,
CLIP, BCLC, and TNM staging.
The Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) staging system integrates
Okuda staging and Child–Pugh score and treatment recommendations,
and is currently endorsed by the American Association for Study of Liver
Disease.8
Stage 0. Solitary lesion <2 cm with preserved liver function. Surgical
resection is the primary treatment. Unfortunately, <5% of patients are
373

resectable because of advanced disease or cirrhosis at presentation.
Recurrent local disease may also be treated surgically, with potential for
cure.
Stage A. Patients who are not eligible for resection (primarily due to
insufficient liver reserve) or who meet the Milan criteria (one tumor ≤5
cm or up to three tumors ≤3 cm, no extrahepatic manifestations, or
vascular invasion). Liver transplantation is the treatment of choice with
5-year survival up to 75%. Patients who are not transplant candidates
should be referred for percutaneous ethanol injection or radiofrequency
ablation.
Stage B. Patients typically have multinodular disease. Transarterial
chemoembolization (TACE) is the treatment of choice. This therapy
involves catheter-guided embolization of tumor-feeding hepatic artery
using materials such as Lipiodol or Gelfoam with or without
chemotherapeutic agents such as cisplatin or doxorubicin. It may provide
a survival benefit. Due to risk of liver failure, TACE is contraindicated in
patients with portal vein thrombosis and most patients with Child C liver
disease.
Stage C. Sorafenib was found to provide a survival benefit versus
supportive care for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma with Child A
disease.9 The median overall survival improved from 7.9 to 10.7 months.
Clinical trials should be recommended if available. Chemotherapeutic
agents such as doxorubicin and capecitabine have a 10% response rate.
Response rate is slightly higher (18% to 20%) with combinations such as
cisplatin/capecitabine and oxaliplatin/gemcitabine.
Stage D. Best supportive care.
COMPLICATIONS

Liver decompensation is of major concern after surgical resection or
TACE.
Complications of liver cirrhosis such as ascites, jaundice, bleeding
diathesis, and variceal bleed are commonly seen.
MONITORING/FOLLOW-UP

374

Patients with chronic HCV or liver cirrhosis should be screened with AFP
and liver ultrasonography every 6 to 12 months.
Due to high risk of recurrence, patients should be followed closely. A
repeat CT scan should be obtained 1 month after surgical resection or
local therapy. CBC, CMP, PT, serum AFP and abdominal
CT/ultrasonography should be obtained every 3 months afterward.
Patients who underwent liver transplantation should be followed by a
liver transplant team regularly.
OUTCOME/PROGNOSIS

Overall 5-year survival for stage 0 and A is 50% to 70%, 3-year survival
of stage B/C is 20% to 40%, and 1-year survival for stage D disease is
<10%, with median survival of 6 months.

GALLBLADDER CANCER

GENERAL PRINCIPLES

Classification

Histology: 85% adenocarcinoma, the rest being squamous cell
carcinoma or mixed type
Epidemiology

Gallbladder cancer is a rare cancer of the biliary system, with ~5000
cases diagnosed per year in North America.
Age: 7th decade.
Sex: M:F, 1:1.7.
Risk Factors

Chronic cholecystitis, cholelithiasis, typhoid carriers. Seventy-five percent
to 98% of patients with gallbladder cancer will have gall stones.
375

Incidence of gallbladder cancer in patients with “Porcelain gallbladder” is
up to 25%.
Prevention

Due to high risk of developing cancer, patients with porcelain gallbladder
or gallbladder polyp >1 cm should be referred for surgery.
Associated Conditions

Gall stones, chronic cholecystitis, gallbladder polyp, typhoid carrier,
inflammatory bowel disease
DIAGNOSIS

Clinical Presentation
History

These tumors may present with symptoms of acute or chronic
cholecystitis, although jaundice and weight loss are more common.
Physical Examination

Scratch marks for pruritus, jaundice, hepatomegaly, right upper quadrant
tenderness, or symptoms/signs of acute cholecystitis
Diagnostic Criteria

Histopathology diagnosis, usually after cholecystectomy, is required.
Differential Diagnosis

Cholecystitis, cholangitis, cholangiocarcinoma, biliary colic,
choledocholithiasis, gallbladder polyp, primary HCC, metastatic cancer,
primary sclerosing cholangitis
Diagnostic Testing
Laboratories

376

CBC, LFT, GGT, BMP, PT, PTT, AFP, and CEA
Imaging

Right upper quadrant ultrasonography is usually the first imaging
modality to be ordered.
When gallbladder tumor is suspected, further imaging modalities such as
liver MRI or abdominal CT should be obtained. MRCP is
recommended to delineate tumor extent and nodal status in more
details.
Diagnostic Procedures

Tissue diagnosis can be made by ERCP if the tumor is distal. However,
diagnosis is often made at the time of surgery.
TREATMENT

The only curative treatment for gallbladder cancer is surgical
resection, but <30% of patients have resectable disease at the time of
presentation. Surgery typically involves cholecystectomy, en bloc hepatic
resection, lymphadenectomy, and possible bile duct resection. Adjuvant
therapy with 5-FU-based concurrent chemoradiation is recommended for
most patients with resected gallbladder cancer, except for those with
very small tumors (T1 N0).
For patients with unresectable but nonmetastatic gallbladder
cancer, therapy with 5-FU-based concurrent chemoradiation is
recommended, provided that the patient has an adequate performance
status and is not jaundiced (total bilirubin ≤3 mg/dL is commonly used).
Jaundiced patient should receive biliary decompression before
chemotherapy.
For patients with metastatic disease, choices of chemotherapy include
cisplatin plus gemcitabine,10 5-FU, or capecitabine. Cisplatin can
be omitted in patients with poorer performance status.
COMPLICATIONS

Obstructive jaundice, cholecystitis, and cholangitis are commonly seen.
377

MONITORING/FOLLOW-UP

After definitive treatment, asymptomatic patients should typically be
evaluated by history and physical examination every 3 months for 2
years, and then every 6 months for 3 additional years. CBC, CMP, and, if
applicable, CA19–9 or CEA and CT scan of chest/abdomen/pelvis should
be obtained during each routine follow-up.
OUTCOME/PROGNOSIS

Five-year survival rates for localized, regional, and distant disease are
40%, 15%, and <10%, respectively. The median survival for advanced
disease is 2 to 4 months.

CHOLANGIOCARCINOMA

GENERAL PRINCIPLES

Definition

Cancers that arise from the biliary duct and before the ampulla of Vater
Classification

Site: intrahepatic (<10%) and extrahepatic origin (>90%). Intrahepatic
cholangiocarcinomas arise in the small intrahepatic ductules or the large
intrahepatic ducts proximal to the bifurcation of the right and left hepatic
ducts. Extrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas originate in any of the major
hepatic or biliary ducts. Klatskin’s tumor refers to extrahepatic
cholangiocarcinoma that arises in the hilum of left and right hepatic duct.
Histology: >95% adenocarcinoma, further subtyped into sclerosing,
nodular, and papillary variants; <5% squamous cell carcinoma.
Epidemiology

378

Cholangiocarcinoma is a rare cancer of the biliary tree, accounting for
~2500 new cases each year in the United States.
Age: 6th decade.
Sex: M:F, ~1:1.
Etiology and Pathophysiology

Largely unknown but chronic inflammation may result in accelerated
mutagenesis and dysplastic change.
Risk Factors

Primary sclerosing cholangitis, hepatolithiasis, choledochal cysts,
ulcerative colitis, and liver fluke infection
DIAGNOSIS

Clinical Presentation
History

Up to 98% of patients with cholangiocarcinomas present with jaundice,
and quite frequently right upper quadrant pain, fever, pruritus, and body
weight loss.
Physical Examination

Jaundice, hepatomegaly, or right upper quadrant mass.
Diagnostic Criteria

Histopathology diagnosis is required.
Differential Diagnosis

Cholecystitis, cholangitis, gallbladder cancer, primary HCC, pancreatic
cancer, cancer of ampulla of Vater, metastatic cancer, primary sclerosing
cholangitis
Diagnostic Testing

379

Laboratories

CBC, BMP, LFT, PT, PTT, CA19–9, and CEA
Imaging

Abdominal CT or ultrasonography is usually the first imaging studies
performed.
When cholangiocarcinoma is suspected, further imaging modalities such
as liver MRI should be obtained. MRCP is recommended to delineate
tumor extent and nodal status in more details.
Diagnostic Procedures

Tissue diagnosis can be made by ERCP if the tumor is distal or by CTguided biopsy if proximal or intrahepatic. Occasionally, diagnosis is often
made at the time of surgery.
TREATMENT

Complete surgical resection offers the only chance of cure. Overall
management depends on location and stage of the disease.
Proximal third including intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma: hilar
resection, lymphadenectomy, and possibly en bloc hepatic resection. If
surgical margin is positive, adjuvant 5-FU- or gemcitabine-based
chemoradiation, radiofrequency ablation, or repeat surgery should be
recommended.
Mid-ductal lesion: bile duct resection and portal lymphadenectomy
followed by adjuvant 5-FU- or gemcitabine-based chemoradiation.
Further chemotherapy with gemcitabine or 5-FU can be considered.
Distal ductal lesion: Pancreaticoduodenectomy plus lymphadenectomy
followed by adjuvant 5-FU- or gemcitabine-based chemoradiation.
Further chemotherapy with gemcitabine or 5-FU can be considered.
Due to lack of standard adjuvant therapy, participation in clinical
trials should be recommended.
Unresectable cholangiocarcinomas or medically unfit patients
can be treated with 5-FU- or gemcitabine-based chemoradiation, or
chemotherapy with 5-FU or gemcitabine alone. The prognosis is poor,
with a median survival of 7 to 12 months.
380

Metastatic disease is typically treated with chemotherapy such as
cisplatin plus gemcitabine.10 In these patients, priority should be
palliation of obstructive jaundice and pain.
COMPLICATIONS

Obstructive jaundice, cholecystitis, and cholangitis are commonly seen.
MONITORING/FOLLOW-UP

After definitive treatment, asymptomatic patients should typically be
evaluated by history and physical examination every 3 months for 2
years, and then every 6 months for 3 additional years. CBC, CMP, and, if
applicable, CA19–9 or CEA and CT scan of chest/abdomen/pelvis should
be obtained during each routine follow-up.
OUTCOME/PROGNOSIS

Prognosis depends on stage and performance status. However, >70% of
patients presented with advanced stage and <10% patients are surgical
candidate.
Patients with distal extrahepatic tumors that are completely resected
have a 5-year survival rate of up to 40%. Overall median survival
duration in patients with localized disease who undergo resection and
adjuvant chemoradiation is 17 to 27.5 months.
Patients who are not surgical candidates and received chemoradiation
alone have a median survival 7 to 17 months.
Patients who can tolerate biliary stenting alone have median survival of
a few months.

GENERAL PRINCIPLES

Definition

Malignant melanoma is an aggressive neoplasm that arises from melanocytes,
which are long-lived pigment–producing cells.1 Melanocytes are located in the basal
layer of the epidermis, hair bulb, eyes, ears, and meninges. Melanoma most
commonly arises in the skin; however, melanoma can also arise in non-cutaneous
sites as well. Intraocular melanoma of the choroid and ciliary body is the most
common ocular malignant tumor in adults, and the most common non-cutaneous
melanoma.2
Classification

Malignant melanoma is traditionally classified into superficial spreading
melanoma (estimated 50% to 75% of melanomas), nodular melanoma (15% to
35%), lentigo maligna melanoma (5% to 15%), acral lentiginous melanoma (5% to
10%), desmoplastic melanoma (uncommon) and a miscellaneous group (rare).1
Superficial spreading melanoma (SSM) is the most common form of melanoma. In
SSM, the melanoma cells demonstrate pagetoid spread in the epidermis, and the
lesions classically show variation in pigmentation. Nodular melanoma (NM) can
appear nodular, polypoid, or pedunculated. Lentigo maligna melanoma (LMM) is
a variant of melanoma that affects the sun-exposed skin, face, and upper extremities
of elderly patients. Lentigo maligna (LM) is a subtype of melanoma in situ and
should be distinguished from LMM. LM typically presents on sun-exposed areas of
middle-aged and elderly individuals, and appears as centrifugally expanding large
patch with variable shades ranging from tan to black.3 The lifetime risk of
383

progression to LMM is approximately 5%. Acral lentiginous melanoma (ALM)
arises in the palmar, plantar, or ungual skin. Most mucosal melanomas, including
those affecting the oral cavity, vulva, vagina, and cervix, share histological features
of ALM.
Epidemiolgy

In the United States, an estimated 68,130 new cases of melanoma will be
diagnosed in 2010, and an estimated 8700 deaths will result from the disease.4
Overall, the incidence of melanoma increased 3.1% annually over the last two
decades.5 The incidence of melanoma rises with increasing age, and is significantly
lower in non-Caucasian populations. About 10% of malignant melanomas present in
familial clusters.
Etiology

The transformation of benign melanocytes to melanoma results from a
collection of genetic changes. Hereditary melanoma typically
demonstrates an autosomal-dominant pattern within multiplex families
[reviewed in6]. Germline mutations in the cyclin-dependent kinase
inhibitor 2A (CDKN2A) gene located on chromosome 9p21 conferred
susceptibility to melanoma with high penetrance. Subsequently, a
second high penetrance gene, the cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4)
gene located on chromosome 12q14, was identified in certain kindreds
that lacked hereditable CDKN2A mutations. Together, these foci account
for about 20% to 57% of disease susceptibility. Two proteins, p14Arf
and p16Ink4a, are encoded by splice variants of the CDKN2A locus. The
p14Arf protein regulates the p53 tumor suppressor network, and loss of
p14Arf results in the indirect loss of p53 function, thereby leading to
dysregulation of cell cycling and DNA damage response. The p16Ink4a
mutant proteins are unable to inhibit Cdk4 and Cdk6, thereby leading to
the inability to suppress phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma (Rb)
protein. Hyperphosphorylation of Rb allows the cell to transition from G1
to S-phase of the cell cycle, and to proliferate. A key pigmentation gene,
the melanocortin-1-receptor (MC1R), has also been implicated as a low
to moderate penetrance melanoma susceptibility gene.
Activating mutations in the BRAF gene have been found in 60% to 80%
of melanoma cases.7 The BRAF gene encodes a serine/threonine protein
kinase that plays an important role in regulating signaling pathways,
384

such as the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway.
Dysregulated BRAF signaling is thought to promote dysregulated cell
division and differentiation. Curtin et al. postulated that the clinical
heterogeneity seen in melanoma could be explained by genetically
distinct types of melanoma, and used array-based comparative genomic
hybridization to interrogate four groups of melanomas, namely,
melanoma on skin without chronic sun-induced damage, melanoma on
skin with chronic sun-induced damage, mucosal melanoma and acral
melanoma.8 Acral or mucosal melanoma had significantly higher degree
of chromosomal aberrations. While amplifications were found in the
majority of acral and mucosal melanomas, they involved different
genomic regions. On the other hand, amplifications were infrequent in
the other two groups. Melanomas on mucosal membranes, acral skin,
and skin with chronic sun-induced damage were found to have infrequent
mutations in BRAF and NRAS, two genes involved with the MAPK
pathway, in contrast to melanomas on skin without chronic sun-induced
damage. On the other hand, somatic activation of KIT was found in a
fraction of melanomas on mucosal membranes (39%), acral skin (36%),
and skin with chronic sun-induced damage (28%), but not in melanomas
on skin without chronic sun-induced damage.9 These findings have
implications for the development of targeted therapies.
Risk Factors

Risk factors for melanoma include environmental factors such as sun exposure
and exposure to artificial ultraviolet (UV) rays via indoor tanning [reviewed in5
and10]. Persons with fair skin, freckles, and inability to tan are more likely to
develop melanoma. Family history of malignant melanoma in a first or seconddegree relative confers increased risk. Persons with large numbers of nevi (>100) or
atypical nevi of any number have a higher risk of developing melanoma. Large
congenital nevi pose a risk of melanoma of approximately 5% to 10%. Organtransplant patients on chronic immunosuppression have a higher risk of developing
skin cancers, including melanoma.
Prevention

Given the association between UV radiation and the development of melanoma,
the use of sunscreen and avoidance of UV rays have been advocated as means of
reducing the risk of developing melanoma. For secondary prevention, patients at risk
385

for developing melanoma might benefit from education on self skin examinations.
Patients should be encouraged to report any unusual or changing nevus.
DIAGNOSIS

Clinical Presentation

The “ABCDE” mnemonic in melanoma diagnosis refers to
asymmetry, border irregularity, color variations, dimension, and
evolution. The clinical history should include queries about risk factors
for melanoma (as outlined earlier in this chapter) and changing nevi 10.
Changes in the color or an increase in size in a new mole are usually the
early signs noted by patients. Later changes include bleeding, itching
and tenderness. A global evaluation of the skin is necessary to assess
the degree of sun damage, number of nevi, distribution of nevi, and the
presence of atypical or dysplastic nevi.
When a lesion suspicious for melanoma is identified, the next key step is
an appropriate biopsy. If melanoma is suspected, a complete
excisional removal into adipose tissue, with a 2-mm margin of
adjacent normal-appearing skin, is preferred. Shave biopsies should
be avoided as they may not provide an accurate Breslow depth, which
is an important part of melanoma staging. For large lesions that are not
easily amenable to complete excision, an incisional full-thickness biopsy
or multiple representative punch biopsies might be acceptable.
Once a diagnosis of melanoma is made, a thorough history and physical
examination will help guide further testing. Lymph nodes should be
carefully examined, and patients with clinically palpable suspicious lymph
nodes should be referred for a lymph node aspirate or open biopsy.
Patients with symptoms suspicious for metastatic disease should be
worked up as appropriate. In patients with distant metastases, a serum
lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) is of prognostic value.
Staging

Staging of melanoma is based on the thickness of the tumor and the
presence of nodal or distant metastases. The absolute depth of invasion
(millimeters) is referred to as the Breslow thickness. The Clark level
386

refers to the depth of invasion into the layers of the skin. Tables 22-1
and 22-2 summarize the 2009 American Joint Committee on Cancer
(AJCC) melanoma staging and classifi-cation.11 The AJCC Melanoma
Staging Committee recommends that a sentinel lymph node (SLN)
biopsy be discussed with otherwise healthy patients who have T2, T3,
and T4 melanomas and clinically uninvolved lymph nodes. Select
patients with T1b melanomas (mitotic rate ≥1/mm2 and a thickness of
≥0.76 mm) may also benefit from a SLN biopsy as such melanomas are
associated with an approximately 10% risk of occult metastases in their
sentinel lymph nodes.11

387

In the Multicenter Selective Lymphadenectomy Trial (MSLT), patients
with intermediate thickness melanomas (1.2 to 3.5 mm in thickness)
were randomized to SLN biopsy or observation.12 All patients underwent
wide excision of the primary melanoma. For those randomized to the
biopsy group, an immediate complete lymphadenectomy was performed
only on those with a positive SLN biopsy. In the observation group, a
delayed complete lymphadenectomy was performed when nodal
recurrence was observed. Among patients with nodal metastases, the 5year survival rate was higher among those who underwent immediate
388

lymphadenectomy compared to those in whom lymphadenectomy was
delayed, with a hazard ratio (HR) of death of 0.51 (95% confidence
interval (CI) of 0.32 to 0.18, p = 0.004), supporting the use of SLN
biopsy as a tool for identifying patients with nodal metastases in whom
early intervention may be beneficial.12

TREATMENT

Local and Locoregional Disease (Stage I to III)

Surgical excision, when feasible, is the primary treatment for
cutaneous melanoma10. Recommended excision margins depend on the
Breslow depth. For melanoma in situ (excluding LM), the recommended
margin is 0.5 to 1.0 cm. For stage Ia (<1 mm) melanomas, a margin of 1
389

cm is considered adequate. For melanomas that are 1 to 2 mm deep, the
recommended margin is at least 1 cm, but up to 2 cm is recommended if
feasible. For melanomas >2 mm deep, the recommended margin is 2
cm.10 Dissection should be sufficiently deep, typically to the level of the
deep subcutaneous tissue at the level of the fascia. As discussed above,
SLN biopsy, followed by an immediate lymphadenectomy if positive, may
be appropriate in select patients. For patients with in-transit melanoma,
local excision of isolated metastases is sometimes feasible. For in-transit
melanoma patients with more widespread cutaneous disease not
amenable to resection, nonsurgical modalities including localized
immune therapy, heated limb perfusion, and external beam radiation
may offer reasonable control.13
Adjuvant systemic therapy with interferon alpha-2b (IFN α2b) has
been extensively evaluated in high-risk stage II and stage III melanoma
after definitive surgical resection. The Eastern Cooperative Group (ECOG)
E1684 trial randomized patients to either high-dose interferon (20
MIU/m2/d intravenously for 1 month then 10 MIU/m2 3 times per week
subcutaneously for 48 weeks) or observation. All patients in this trial
underwent a complete regional lymphadenectomy. Earlier reports of this
trial indicated a significant prolongation of relapse free survival (RFS)
and overall survival (OS) in favor of adjuvant high-dose interferon.14
However, with longer term follow-up, whilst the benefit in RFS is
maintained, the improvement in OS reported earlier was diminished.15 A
pooled analysis of ECOG and Intergroup trials of high-dose inter-feron
(HDI) in melanoma (which included E1684) failed to demonstrate an OS
survival benefit in the pooled population. Different dosing16,17 and
duration of interferon treatment18 have been evaluated, with largely
similar results. Toxicities of HDI include constitutional symptoms,
neurologic toxicities, myelosuppression, and hepatotoxicity. The
nontrivial toxicities of HDI and the absence of unequivocal benefit led to
controversy regarding its appropriateness in this setting. Other
investigations into systemic adjuvant therapies were reviewed by Algazi
et al.13
Distant Metastatic Disease (Stage IV)

Survival in patients with distant metastases is poor. Resection of solitary
390

skin, lung, or brain metastases can be considered. As treatment options
for metastatic melanoma are limited, enrollment in a clinical trial,
whenever feasible, is recommended for patients with stage IV disease.
Dacarbazine, an alkylating agent, is the only chemotherapy approved
by the Federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of
metastatic melanoma. Temozolomide, a close analog of dacarbazine, is
more commonly used because it can be administered orally. In a
randomized Phase III trial comparing temozolomide to dacarbazine, the
response rates were similar at 13.1% and 12.1%, respectively.19 The
median OS was similar in both arms, although temozolomide has a
marginally longer median progression free survival of 1.9 months versus
1.5 months. High dose interleukin-2 (IL-2) is also FDA-approved for
treatment of metastatic melanoma. Atkins et al. reported on 270
assessable patients with metastatic melanoma who were entered onto
eight clinical trials involving IL-2 conducted between 1985 and 1993.20
The overall objective response rate was 16% (95% CI of 12% to 21%),
with 17 complete responses (CRs) (6%) and 26 partial responses (PRs)
(10%). In this series, high dose IL-2 appeared to produce durable CRs or
PRs in a small subset of patients. Unfortunately, high dose IL-2 is a
highly toxic regimen that is challenging to administer. Some patients
receiving high dose IL-2 will even require vasopressor support in an
intensive care unit.
Two recently published trials provided encouraging results for systemic
treatment of metastatic melanoma. Hodi et al.21 reported on a Phase III
trial evaluating ipilimumab, an antibody that blocks cytotoxic Tlymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4), and the gp100 vaccine, a
synthetic peptide cancer vaccine consisting of amino acid residues 209
through 217 of the glycoprotein 100 (gp100) melanoma antigen. In this
study, 676 patients with unresectable stage III or IV malignant
melanoma were randomly assigned, in a 3:1:1 ratio, to receive
ipilimumab plus gp100 (n = 403 patients), ipilimumab alone (n = 137),
or gp100 alone (n = 136).16 The median OS was 10.0 months among
patients receiving ipilimumab plus gp100, compared to 6.4 months
among patients receiving gp100 alone (HR for death, 0.68; P < 0.001).
Median OS with ipilimumab alone was 10.1 months (HR for death in the
comparison with gp100 alone, 0.66; P = 0.003). These data
demonstrated the efficacy of ipilimumab in metastatic melanoma. In
391

another study, Flaherty et al.22 reported on a phase I dose-escalation
trial of PLX4032, an oral inhibitor of mutated BRAF. In the doseescalation cohort, of the 16 patients with melanoma whose tumors
carried the V600E BRAF mutation, there were 10 PRs and 1 CR. Among
the 32 patients in the extension cohort of melanoma patients whose
tumors carried the V600E BRAF mutation, 24 had a PR and 2 had a CR.
The estimated median progression-free survival among all patients was
more than 7 months, suggesting that BRAF inhibition may be a viable
therapeutic strategy in BRAF mutated melanoma. Another potential
therapeutic target is c-kit. Hodi et al. reported a major response to
imatinib mesylate, an oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor which inhibits c-kit, in
a patient with a c-kit-mutated melanoma, suggesting that targeting of
this pathway may also represent a therapeutic avenue worth evaluating
in select patients.23
PROGNOSIS
Prognosis is dependent on stage of disease.11 In patients with localized
melanomas (stage I and II), 10-year survival ranges from 93% for stage IA to 39%
for stage IIC. In these patients, increasing tumor thickness and mitotic rate are
associated with declining survival rates. Patients with ulcerated melanomas have
proportionately lower survival rates than those with equivalent T staged nonulcerated tumors. In patients with regional metastatic melanoma (stage III), the 5year survival rates were 78%, 59%, and 40% for patients with stage IIIA, IIIB, and
IIIC melanoma, respectively. In patients with distant metastatic melanoma (stage IV),
the site(s) of metastases and serum LDH levels delineate the M1 stage into M1a,
M1b, and M1c (as shown in Table 22-1). The 1-year survival rates were 62%, 53%,
and 33% for M1a, M1b, and M1c melanomas, respectively.

GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) represents 5% of
newly diagnosed cancers in adult patients in the United States. There are more than
500,000 new cases that are diagnosed annually worldwide.1 While there are many
similarities between head and neck cancers arising from different sites, there are
particular differences in anatomy, natural history, and functional consequence that
present unique treatment challenges for each site.
Classification

Malignancies of the head and neck are classified by their anatomic location,
which is divided into (a) lip and oral cavity, (b) oropharynx, (c) larynx and
hypopharynx, (d) nasopharynx, (e) nasal cavity and sinuses, and (f) salivary glands.
With the exception of salivary gland tumors, squamous cell carcinoma accounts for
>90% of head and neck tumors. As nasopharyngeal cancer and neck masses with
unknown primary have different epidemiology and/or management, they are
discussed separately.

SQUAMOUS CELL CARCINOMA OF THE HEAD AND NECK

GENERAL PRINCIPLES

Epidemiology

395

Head and neck cancers have a significant male predominance, with a male-tofemale ratio of 3:1. These tumors are estimated to account for ~45,000 new cases
per year, with an estimated 11,000 deaths per year. Incidence and mortality are
higher in African-Americans.
Pathophysiology

SCCHN is an example of the multistep process of carcinogenesis with
accumulated genetic mutations that result in changes ranging from hyperplasia to
dysplasia to carcinoma in situ to invasive cancer. Statistical analysis based on the
age-specific incidence of head and neck cancer suggests that HNSCC tumors arise
after the accumulation of 6 to 10 independent genetic events. These studies
demonstrated consistent chromosomal abnormalities and the presence of important
alterations. Loss of chromosomes 3p, 5q, 8p, 9p, 18q, and 21q were commonly
identified, and data also suggest that loss of 18q may indicate the presence of a
tumor with a poor prognosis.2 Moderateincreases in epidermal growth factor
receptor (EGFR) copy number are observed in SCCHN, and EGFR signaling is a
key pathway in HNSCC tumorigenesis.3 In some tumors, an alternately translated
EGFR variant (EGFRvIII) contributes to head and neck growth and resistance to
EGFR targeting.
Risk Factors

The main risk factors for development of these malignancies are
tobacco in any form and alcohol use. Tobacco and alcohol are
sources of carcinogens that increase the risk of cancer in a dosedependent fashion and are synergistic in their effects. Field cancerization
is a key concept in the natural history of head and neck cancer. Exposure
of the mucosa to carcinogens in tobacco is diffuse across the
aerodigestive tract. Consequently, tumors may be surrounded by areas
of dysplasia or carcinoma in situ. Patients diagnosed with a head and
neck cancer are at an increased risk of developing new primary tumors in
the head and neck, lung, and esophagus. The risk is estimated to be 3%
to 4% per year. Sun exposure has been associated with an increased risk
of carcinoma of the lip.
Approximately 20% of head and neck cancers, however, occur in people
without these established risk factors. A subset of these cancers includes
human papilloma virus (HPV)-associated tumors of the oropharynx.4
Risk factors for HPV-associated tumors of the oropharynx include an
396

increasing number of sexual partners, the practice of oral sex, a history
of genital warts, and a younger age at first sexual intercourse. As in
cervical cancer, HPV-16 and HPV-18 are thought to play an important
role. These HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancers were less likely to occur
among heavy smokers and drinkers, less likely to harbor a p53 mutation,
and had an improved disease-specific survival. Another group suggested
that HPV-positive tumors may also inactivate Rb and harbor a better
prognosis.
DIAGNOSIS

Clinical Presentation

The clinical presentation of these malignancies varies depending on the
anatomic location of the tumor. Cancers of the lip and oral cavity
often present with nonhealing lesions in the mouth, pain in the mouth or
ear, trismus, weight loss, and “hot potato speech.” Leukoplakia and
erythroplakia are pre-malignant lesions of the mucosa and are frequently
seen in conjunction with dysplastic changes or invasive carcinoma.
Cancers of the nasal cavity can present with epistaxis, nonhealing
ulcers, or obstruction.
Cancers of the oropharynx present with many of the features
associated with cancers of the lip and oral cavity. Bleeding from the
mouth, alterations in speech, dysphagia, odynophagia, otalgia, and
weight loss can be symptoms of oropharyngeal cancers.
Cancers of the larynx and hypopharynx can present challenges in
management, as these anatomic structures are intricately associated
with the key functions of speech and swallowing. Symptoms include
dysphagia, odynophagia, weight loss, dyspnea (including dyspnea with
speech), and hoarseness. Symptoms of aspiration should also be
elucidated in the history. However, the time of presentation of these
cancers varies greatly with their primary site. Supraglottic tumors or
tumors in the pyriform sinus may be diagnosed only after cervical
metastases occur because symptoms of dysphagia may not become
significant until the tumors are quite advanced. On the other hand,
glottic carcinomas are associated with symptoms of hoarseness even
397

when they are small, which may lead to earlier detection.
Diagnostic Testing

The initial workup of suspected head and neck cancers includes a
detailed history and physical examination. Assessment should include a
cranial nerve exam, assessment of status of dentition, and examination
of tongue movement and atrophy. Lymph nodes in the neck should be
palpated, and measurements taken of palpable nodes. Suspicious lesions
should be biopsied for histologic confirmation and grading.
Imaging studies should include a chest radiograph, Panorex x-ray for
mandibular bony involvement for cancers that abut the mandible, and
computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the
head and neck to help further delineate disease extent at presentation.
Panendoscopy, including esophagoscopy with direct laryngoscopy,
helps characterize the primary lesion and evaluates for possible second
tumors, as there is a 10% to 15% incidence of synchronous primary
tumors. A CT scan of the chest should also be performed to rule out
pulmonary metastases. Positron emission tomography (PET) or CT may
also be helpful in the staging of head and neck cancers and are used at
some centers. The staging for head and neck cancer is according to the
American Joint Committee on Cancer TNM system, with different staging
for SCCHN (Tables 23-1 through 23-6).

TREATMENT
401

Management of patients requires a multidisciplinary approach, including
head and neck surgeons and radiation and medical oncologists, along
with allied health professionals including speech language pathologists
and nutritionists. Radiation and surgery are the mainstays of treatment
with head and neck cancers. Chemotherapy is reserved for patients with
regionally advanced disease or metastatic disease.

402

Patientswith stage I and stage II SCCHN as a group have survival
rate of 70% to 80% with standard therapy, which includes either surgery
or radiotherapy alone. Surgery is generally the preferred approach in
operable patients, because it is typically associated with less morbidity
than RT. Definitive RT is reserved for patients who cannot tolerate
surgery or for whom surgical resection would result in particularly
significant functional loss. Chemotherapy is unproven as first-line
curative treatment for early SCCHN and should not be used outside the
setting of a clinical trial. Although outcomes with primary surgery and
definitive RT are comparable, neither surgery nor RT has been compared
403

in a randomized trial. Thus, outcomes are based upon retrospective
reviews or uncontrolled case series.
Unfortunately, patients often present with advanced locoregional
disease and carry poor prognosis with survival rate of 50% to 60% at 2
years with standard therapy.5 Failure to control the tumor occurs via two
biologically distinct pathways: local recurrence and/or metastatic spread.
This makes the treatment of locoregionally advanced SCCHN complex as
it continues to evolve. Patients with tumors amenable to surgical
resection undergo surgery followed by adjuvant therapy with
postoperative radiation or concurrent chemoradiation. For patients with
locally advanced, unresectable disease, the standard of care is definitive
concurrent chemoradiation for patients who can tolerate such therapy
because an 8% survival advantage for concurrent chemoradiation
compared to radiation alone, particularly with the use of platinum
chemotherapy, was shown by meta-analyses of more than 10,000
patients from 63 randomized trials. Usually this entails the use of
cisplatin, 100 mg/m2, on days 1, 22, and 43 of a 7-week course of 70 Gy
of radiation. More recently, an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)
inhibitor, cetuximab (Erbitux), has demonstrated benefits when used
concurrently with radiation. In patients who do not achieve a complete
tumor response after definitive chemoradiation, surgical resection of
residual tumor may improve survival.
In patientswith distant metastases, several standard chemotherapeutic
agents have significant activity against SCCHN and can provide palliation
of symptoms. These include cisplatin, carboplatin, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU),
paclitaxel, docetaxel, pemetrexed, methotrexate, ifosfamide, and
gemcitabine. The most commonly used first-line therapy is a platinum
compound combined with a second agent, usually a taxane or 5-FU.
First-line therapy typically has a tumor response rate of ~20% to 30%.
Targeted therapy also has a significant role in the management of
SCCHN. Cetuximab has recently been found to extend survival in
recurrent and/or metastatic SCCHN when added to chemotherapy.
Cetuximab is also a reasonable option for platinum-resistant disease.
COMPLICATIONS

A multidisciplinary approach is essential to minimize the complications of
404

the malignancy and treatment. Complications of disease include
weight loss, aspiration, and airway compromise. Nutritional support in
the form of oral supplements or enteral feedings may be needed when
caloric intake is inadequate. Tracheostomy may be needed in cases of
airway compromise. Head and neck tumors may also invade into key
structures, such as the carotid artery, leading to major bleeding, which
may be a terminal event. Invasion into neural structures may lead to
neuropathic pain syndromes. Amitriptyline or gabapentin may be helpful
in such cases. The limitation to swallowing imposed by some head and
neck cancers can make pain management difficult. In such cases,
transdermal fentanyl patches or methadone elixir can be used in
conjunction with concentrated opiate elixirs (breakthrough) for pain
relief.
Complications of treatment include complications of surgery, acute
radiation toxicity, late radiation effects, and complications of
chemotherapy. Acute radiation toxicity may include severe mucositis,
with resulting pain and difficulties with swallowing. Concurrent
chemoradiation increases the risk of severe mucositis beyond radiation
alone. Oral candidiasis complicating mucositis may be treated with
topical or systemic antifungal agents. Many patients find a cocktail of
equal volume of diphenhydramine suspension, nystatin, viscous
lidocaine, and aluminum hydroxide/magnesium hydroxide (“magic
mouthwash”) as a topical oral swish-and-swallow solution to be helpful.
Opiates can also help in pain management, especially in severe cases.
Skin toxicity should be treated with emollients. Late radiation effects
include xerostomia, dental caries, osteoradionecrosis, and fibrosis of
neck tissues resulting in trismus, lymphedema, and loss of range of
motion. Xerostomia can be treated with cholinergic stimulants such as
pilocarpine to improve salivary flow. Other measures, including topical
lubricants, lozenges, coating agents, and artificial saliva, may provide
some transient relief. The risk of dental caries should be minimized with
good dental care. Osteoradionecrosis may be treated conservatively with
antibiotics, hyperbaric oxygen therapy, or surgical debridement.
Exercises may help in prevention of trismus associated with radiation
therapy. With neck irradiation, hypothyroidism may occur, which can be
treated with thyroid replacement therapy.
The complications of chemotherapy are dependent on the agents
405

used. Platinum compounds, a mainstay of chemotherapy in head and
neck cancer, are known to cause significant nausea, nephrotoxicity,
ototoxicity, myelosuppression, and peripheral neuropathy. 5-FU, another
commonly used agent, is associated with mucositis and
myelosuppression. Cetuximab, a newer agent, is associated with rash,
diarrhea, hypomagnesemia, paronychial inflammation,
andhypersensitivityinfusionreactions.
MONITORING/FOLLOW-UP
Patients should have close follow-up for evaluation of local recurrence and
distant metastases, as well as physical therapy and speech pathology follow-up if
needed. In addition, patients should be advised on tobacco and alcohol cessation.
PROGNOSIS
Patients with recurrent or metastatic squamous cell carcinomas of the head and
neck have a median survival of 6 to 9 months, and a 1-year survival rate of 20% to
40% when treated with chemotherapy alone.6 Common sites of distant metastases
include the bone, lung, and liver.

NASOPHARYNGEAL CARCINOMA

GENERAL PRINCIPLES

Epidemiology

Nasopharyngeal carcinoma has a different epidemiology and a separate set of
risk factors from the other head and neck cancers. Although rare in the United States,
it is endemic in the Far and Middle East and in Africa, especially in Southern China
and Southeast Asia. It accounts for 18% of newly diagnosed malignancies in
Southeast China.
Risk Factors

406

In Southeast Asia, nasopharyngeal cancer is associated with Epstein–Barr virus
infection in genetically predisposed individuals. Other risk factors have been
implicated, including diet (consumption of salted fish and low intake of fresh fruits
and vegetables) and smoking.
DIAGNOSIS

Clinical Presentation

Nasopharyngeal cancer can present with a painless neck mass, but other
symptoms include nasal obstruction, epistaxis, dysphagia, odynophagia, and
Eustachian tube obstruction with otitis media. Tumors may extend through the
foramen ovale to access the middle cranial fossa and the cavernous sinus to involve
the oculomotor, trochlear, trigeminal, and abducens nerves leading to cranial
neuropathy. In advanced cases, the optic nerve and orbital invasion can occur.
Headaches, weight loss, trismus, and referred pain to the ear and neck can also be
symptoms. Physical examination should include a thorough examination of the nares
and oral cavity and the cranial nerves. Proptosis suggests orbital invasion by the
tumor.
Diagnostic Testing

Workup of patients with nasopharyngeal cancer should include a thorough
physical evaluation and diagnostic imaging with CT or MRI from the skull down to
the clavicles. Endoscopy should also be performed. A chest x-ray or CT scan
should be done to assess for pulmonary metastases. The staging for nasopharynx is
according to the American Joint Committee on Cancer TNM system (Tables 23-7
and 23-8).
TREATMENT
Nasopharyngeal carcinoma is very sensitive to chemoradiation. Early-stage
disease (stages I and II) is typically treated with radiation therapy alone. For local
recurrences, surgical resection or repeat irradiation are options for treatment. For
advanced disease (stages III and IV), concurrent chemoradiation followed by
adjuvant cisplatin and 5-FU has demonstrated benefit in terms of overall survival,
progression-free survival, and control of local disease and distant metastases.7
407

Metastatic disease is managed with chemotherapeutic agents such as cisplatin,
carboplatin, and 5-FU.

SALIVARY GLAND TUMORS

GENERAL PRINCIPLES

408

Salivary gland tumors may arise either in the major glands, namely, the parotid,
submandibular, and sublingual glands, or in the minor glands located in the oral
mucosa, palate, uvula, floor of the mouth, posterior tongue, retromolar area and
peritonsillar area, pharynx, larynx, and paranasal sinuses. Salivary gland tumors
account for ~5% of all head and neck cancers and are varied in their histologic
patterns as low- or high-grade malignancies. Approximately 80% arise from the
parotid gland, but of those, 80% are benign. In contrast, 95% to 100% of tumors
arising from the sublingual gland are malignant.

TREATMENT

409

Treatment usually involves surgical resection of the gland. Prognosis is more
favorable for low-grade tumors and those located in major glands, especially in the
parotid. For aggressive or bulky tumors, resection is often combined with
postoperative radiation.

NECK MASS WITH AN UNKNOWN PRIMARY

DIAGNOSIS

Differential Diagnosis

The differential diagnosis for a malignant neck mass includes squamous cell
carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, lymphoma, thyroid neoplasms, and melanoma.
Diagnostic Testing

As cancers that originate elsewhere in the body can also present with a neck
mass, a thorough history and physical should be performed, along with evaluation
for potential primary sites. A fine-needle biopsy for cytology may be pursued as
the initial step for evaluation of a neck mass without a clear primary. Open biopsy
may be helpful if the suspicion for lymphoma is high. If the cytology shows
squamous cell carcinoma, then endoscopy with blind biopsy of potential sites in the
nasopharynx, tonsils, base of tongue, and pyriform sinus should be performed.
TREATMENT
If no primary site is found and the tumor is amenable to resection, surgical
resection may be the primary therapy. If the surgical pathology shows extracapsular
extension or involvement of multiple nodes, postoperative radiation may be given. If
the tumor is not amenable to surgical resection, radiation therapy is the primary
treatment modality.

GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Sarcomas (from the Greek sarx for flesh) are a rare group of malignancies of the
connective tissue. They represent over 100 different histologies of tumors derived
from the mesenchymal or ectodermal germ layers. The presenting signs and
symptoms depend on the anatomic site of origin and can vary markedly. In general,
sarcomas can be divided into two large groups: soft tissue tumors and bone tumors.
Epidemiology

Sarcomas are rare tumors, comprising 1% of adult malignancies and 7% of
pediatric malignancies. Sarcomas occur with equal frequency in both genders.1 In
the United States in 2010, the estimated incidence of soft tissue sarcomas (STSs) and
bone sarcomas is 13,170 cases per year, with 5380 deaths expected.1 Compared to
other rare tumors, sarcomas carry a high mortality rate.
Risk Factors

Most cases of sarcoma are sporadic; however, a number of etiologic factors
have been identified, as detailed below.
Radiation
Sarcomas have been found to originate in or near tissues that have
received prior external-beam radiation therapy and tend to develop at
least 2 years after radiation therapy, but can develop decades after
radiation.2–4 The majority of these lesions are high grade, and they are
typically osteosarcomas, malignant fibrous histiocytomas, and
412

angiosarcomas. The relative risk of radiation-induced sarcoma is 0.6 for
patients that receive 10 Gy of radiation and 38.3 for patients that receive
60 Gy.5
Chemical exposure
Thorotrast, an IV contrast dye, has been found to cause hepatic
angiosarcomas.6 Other agents such as vinyl chloride,7 arsenic,8 and
dioxin in chemical workers and farmers but not in Vietnam Veterans (i.e.,
dioxin is in Agent Orange) has also been linked to sarcomas.9 Alkylating
chemotherapy, particularly when used to treat childhood malignancies,
has also been associated with the development of sarcomas in
adulthood.5
Genetic conditions
Patients with neurofibromatosis type I have a 10% risk of developing a
malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor.10 Sarcomas also occur in
patients with Li-Fraumeni syndrome.11 Familial retinoblastoma is linked
to the development of osteosarcoma5 and Werner syndrome is a risk
factor for multiple types of sarcomas.12
Other risks associated with sarcomas
Lymphangiosarcomas have been known to develop in a lymphedematous
arm after mastectomy (Stewart-Treves syndrome).13 Kaposi sarcoma is
associated with co-infection with the human immunodeficiency virus and
the human herpes virus 8.14 Paget disease of bone is a risk factor for the
development of osteosarcoma or fibrosarcoma.15
SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
The treatment of sarcoma is complex because sarcoma is an ever growing group
of many very rare diseases that are historically treated as large group in clinical
trials. As many of specific subtypes are driven by known translocations, the
treatment and understanding of each individual subtype is rapidly evolving.16–18
Translocation-based treatment of sarcoma is the reason patients with sarcomas
should be treated by physicians that specifically sub-specialize in the treatment
of sarcoma.

SOFT TISSUE SARCOMAS
413

DIAGNOSIS

Clinical Presentation

Soft tissue sarcomas represent greater than 75% of all sarcomas diagnosed each
year.1 Patients typically present with an asymptomatic mass. Pain may be present if
there is entrapment of neurovascular structures or involvement of bone. Sarcomas
may grow quite large before they become obvious on physical exam.19
Extremity sarcomas
Approximately half of all soft tissue sarcomas arise in the extremities.
The majority are first seen as a painless soft tissue mass.
Retroperitoneal sarcomas
Most patients have an abdominal mass and approximately half have
abdominal pain that is vague and nonspecific. Weight loss is seen less
frequently, with early satiety, nausea, and emesis occurring in <40% of
patients. Neurologic symptoms, particularly paresthesia, occur in up to
30% of patients.20,21
Physical Examination

Physical examination of a patient presenting with a soft tissue mass should
include an assessment of the size of the mass and its mobility with respect to the
underlying tissue. If a mass is >5 cm and deep, it should be presumed to be sarcoma
until proven otherwise. High-grade sarcomas may have significant necrosis and can
be confused with a hematoma or abscess. A site-specific neurovascular examination
should also be performed.
Differential Diagnosis

The differential diagnosis includes benign soft tissue tumors as well as
carcinoma, lymphoma, and melanoma. The most common benign tumors include
lipoma, desmoid tumor, neurofibroma, hemangioma, and schwannoma.
Diagnostic Testing
Imaging

414

Patients with masses suspicious for sarcoma should undergo radiologic
evaluation and biopsy. The studies needed for adequate staging vary depending on
the site of disease. Sarcoma of the head and neck or extremities should be evaluated
with plain films and MRI. Plain films may reveal soft tissue mineralization (which
is typical for synovial sarcoma) or may reveal skeletal reaction to the tumor. MRI is
valuable for assessing fat and distinguishing it from surrounding tissues. This may
assist in the diagnosis of the lesion and allows for planning of the biopsy and
subsequent surgery. For retroperitoneal and abdominal sarcomas, CT is the imaging
modality of choice, as this provides the best anatomic definition of the tumor.
In addition to evaluating the primary lesion with imaging, distant metastatic
disease may also be assessed. STS spreads hematogenously, and the lung is the
most common site of metastasis. Chest x-ray may be sufficient for small, low-grade
lesions, but in patients with high-grade tumors or tumors larger than 5 cm, a staging
CT of the chest should be performed.
Diagnostic Procedures

An accurate biopsy diagnosis is essential for STS. Any lesion >5 cm or
any rapidly growing lesion should be biopsied. The placement of the
biopsy tract is also critical, as it can be seeded with tumor and must be
excised at the time of resection. Generally, the preferred technique is
open incisional biopsy performed by a surgeon with experience in
resection of STS. Hemostasis is also very important, as a hematoma may
require enlarging radiation fields or may interfere with resection
planning.
Histologic evaluation should be performed at an experienced center,
as grade is critically important to determining prognosis. STSs
are named for their tissue of origin based on light microscopy
examination, and there are many possible histological types (Table 241). Tumors are also carefully evaluated for grade, which takes into
account cellularity, mitotic activity, nuclear atypia, and necrosis. In
general, the grade, size, and depth are more important factors than the
histologic type. Immunohistochemistry and FISH studies are used to
subclassify STS. The three most common types of STS are malignant
fibrous histiocytoma, liposarcoma, and leiomyosarcoma.

415

TREATMENT

Early-Stage Disease (Stages I to III)

Extremity soft tissue sarcomas
Surgery. Surgery is the mainstay of therapy for early-stage STSs of the
extremities. Sarcomas grow along planes and grossly appear to be well
encapsulated. However, they usually extend into the pseudocapsule (an
area around the tumor that is composed of tumor fimbriae and normal
tissue), and “shelling-out” of lesions is associated with high local
recurrence rates, 37% to 63%. In the past, radical excision and
amputation were utilized to avoid this problem. Over the past 20 years,
there has been a gradual shift in the surgical management of extremity
soft tissue sarcomas away from radical ablative surgery toward limbsparing surgery. Amputation is only required in [H33522] 5% of patients
today.
Radiation therapy. Wide local excision alone is all that is necessary for
small (T1), low-grade, STSs of the extremities, with a local recurrence
rate of <10%. Adjuvant radiation therapy, however, is required in a
number of situations: (a) virtually all high-grade extremity sarcomas, (b)
lesions larger than 5 cm (T2), and (c) positive or equivocal surgical
margins in patients for whom re-excision is impractical. When adjuvant
416

radiation is planned, metal clips should be placed at margins of resection
to facilitate radiation field planning. Neoadjuvant radiation may be
needed prior to definitive resection. This is most commonly performed
for tumors that are borderline resectable or for tumors located adjacent
to the joint capsule. A phase III National Cancer Institute of Canada trial
comparing adjuvant (postoperative) and neoadjuvant (preoperative)
radiation demonstrated similar local control rates, metastatic outcome,
and overall survival rates between the two arms. However, patients
receiving preoperative radiation had a significantly higher incidence of
wound complications (35% vs. 17%).22
Radiation as definitive therapy alone in the treatment of
unresectable or medically inoperable soft tissue sarcoma patients yields
a 5-year survival rate of 25% to 40% and a local control rate of 30%.
Radiation doses should be at least 65 Gy, if feasible, given the site of the
lesion.
Brachytherapy also has been used in treatment for sarcomas. Iridium192 is the most commonly used agent. It has similar local control rates
to adjuvant external beam radiation and has the advantage of a
decrease in the patient’s entire treatment from 10 to 12 weeks to 10 to
12 days. In addition, smaller volumes of tissues are irradiated, which
may be useful if important structures, such as joints, are nearby.
Adjuvant chemotherapy. The benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy for
extremity STSs is controversial. The only exception to this is
rhabdomyosarcomas, in which adjuvant chemotherapy is accepted as
standard of care.
A formal meta-analysis of individual data from 1568 patients who
participated in 13 trials was performed by the Sarcoma Meta-Analysis
Collaboration. The analysis demonstrated a significant reduction in the
risk of local or distant recurrence in patients who received adjuvant
chemotherapy. There also was a decrease in the risk of distant relapse
(metastasis) by 30% in treated patients. Overall survival, however, did
not meet criteria for statistical significance between the control groupand
adjuvant chemotherapy arm, with a hazard ratio of 0.89.23 Most of the
randomized trials examined in this meta-analysis were limited by patient
numbers, inclusion of all subtypes of STS and of low-grade tumors,
heterogeneous patient and disease characteristics, and varied
chemotherapy regimens.
417

Certain subgroups of patients, such as those with high-grade lesions,
may benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy, but further studies are
needed.
Retroperitoneal sarcomas
Surgery. As with other soft tissue sarcomas, surgery is the primary
treatment of retroperitoneal sarcomas. Tumors that are <5 cm and that
not located close to adjacent viscera or critical neurovascular structures
are considered resectable. If a tumor is thought to be a sarcoma and is
resectable, a preoperative biopsy is not necessary. One should consider
a preoperative CT-guided core biopsy if an incomplete resection is a
reasonable possibility to allow neoadjuvant therapy.
Unfortunately, only 50% of patients with early-stage retroperitoneal
sarcomas are able to undergo complete surgical resection. Of the tumors
removed, approximately half will develop a local recurrence. Adjuvant
therapy, therefore, plays an important role in the management of
retroperitoneal sarcomas.
Radiation therapy. Adjuvant radiation therapy is most frequently
recommended for patients with high-grade tumors or positive margins.
The radiation is typically started 3 to 8 weeks following surgery to allow
wound healing. Two-year local control rates of 70% have been reported
with the addition of postoperative radiation therapy. Neoadjuvant
radiation therapy can be given to patients with marginally resectable
tumors and to those in whom one would expect postoperative
radiotherapy to be required. It has a number of advantages over
postoperative radiotherapy including smaller radiation portals and
reduction of the extent of the surgical procedure.
Management of unresectable, locally advanced retroperitoneal
sarcomas. Unresectable retroperitoneal sarcomas can be managed in a
number of ways. Radiation therapy can be given for palliation and with
the hope that the tumor could be made resectable. Palliative surgery to
reduce local symptoms can be performed. Chemotherapy can also be
administered (see management of metastatic patients for specific
regimens).
Stage IV Metastatic Soft Tissue Sarcomas

Metastatic STSs can be divided into limited metastasis and extensive metastasis.
Limited metastatic disease is defined as resectable metastasis involving one organ
418

system. The prognosis of these two subsets of patients is very different. It is possible
to cure limited metastatic disease, whereas patients with extensive metastatic
disease can only be palliated.
Management of limited metastatic disease. For patients with a limited
number of pulmonary metastases, metastasectomy has been performed
with some improvement in survival compared with no surgery. In
patients with visceral sarcomas and limited liver metastasis, it is
sometimes possible to perform a metastasectomy by surgery,
chemoembolization, or radiofrequency ablation.
Management of extensive metastatic disease. The goal of therapy for
patients with metastatic sarcoma is palliation and prolongation of
survival. Cure is no longer a viable goal. Systemic chemotherapy is the
primary modality of treatment. Radiation and surgery may be used with
a goal of palliation.
Numerous chemotherapy agents have been used as single agents or in
combination for the treatment of soft tissue sarcomas. These include epirubicin,
doxorubicin, ifosfamide, cyclophosphamide, dacarbazine, gemcitabine, and taxanes
amongst others.
PROGNOSIS

The most important prognostic factors for STS are size, grade, depth,
and relationship to fascial planes. The American Joint Committee on
Cancer (AJCC) staging system for STSs incorporates histologic grade (G),
size of the primary (T), nodal involvement (N), and distant metastasis
(M) (Table 24-2).24
Grade of the tumor is the predominant feature predicting early
metastatic recurrence and death. Beyond 2 years of follow-up, the size of
the lesion becomes as important as the histologic grade.
Nomograms exist for the relapse-free survival prediction by histology.

BONE SARCOMAS

GENERAL PRINCIPLES
419

Bone sarcoma may arise from any tissue within the bones. The most common
bone sarcomas are osteosarcoma, chondrosarcoma, and Ewing sarcoma.
Classification

Osteosarcoma
Osteosarcoma is the most common primary bone tumor, accounting for
40% to 50% of bone sarcomas.25 It usually presents with pain and
swelling. Approximately 60% occur in adolescents and children. Ten
percent may occur in the third decade. There is a second peak in the fifth
and sixth decades, which is frequently due to radiation-associated
osteosarcomas or transformation of existing lesions. They are spindle
cell neoplasms that produce bone and are more common in long bones.
Most osteosarcomas occur in the metaphyseal region, near the growth
plate, of skeletally immature long bones. The distal femur, proximal
tibia, and proximal humerus are common sites. The majority is classified
as “classic,” and this type is more common at between 10 and 20 years
of age. Most of these lesions are high grade and highly vascular.
Chondrosarcoma
Chondrosarcoma is the second most frequent malignant primary bone
tumor, representing approximately 20% of bone sarcomas. They
generally occur between the fourth and the sixth decades. They tend to
develop in flat bones, including the shoulder and pelvic girdles. They
may arise de novo or from preexisting lesions. They are indolent and are
generally low grade. Chondrosarcoma may arise peripherally or centrally.
Imaging studies may be bland, particularly in central lesions, which may
make it difficult to distinguish between benign and malignant lesions.
New pain, increasing size, and signs of inflammation point toward
malignant lesions. In general, these malignancies are resistant to
chemotherapy and radiation.

420

Ewing sarcoma
Ewing sarcoma accounts for 10% to 15% of bone sarcomas, and
incidence peaks in the second decade. It is the second most common
malignant tumor of the bone in childhood and adolescence. It tends to
occur in the diaphysis of long bones. The femoral diaphysis is the most
common location. These are highly aggressive tumors and are best
considered a systemic disease. A characteristic chromosomal
translocation, t (11:22), is associated with this sarcoma and with
peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET). Ewing sarcoma is
one of the small, round, blue cell tumors.
DIAGNOSIS
An accurate tissue biopsy is needed for diagnosis. Imaging studies may be
suggestive of tumor type; however, it can be difficult to distinguish benign and
malignant bone tumors. Biopsy specimens are used to determine the histologic type
of tumor as well as the grade. As with STSs, open incisional biopsy is preferred
for bone sarcomas. The biopsy should be performed by a surgeon experienced in
sarcoma so that it does not compromise the definitive surgical procedure.
Clinical Presentation

421

History

Localized pain and swelling are the hallmark clinical features of bone sarcomas.
The pain is initially insidious but can become unremitting. Occasionally, a
pathologic fracture will bring the patient to medical attention. If the tumor arises in
the lower extremities, the patient may have a limp. Constitutional symptoms are rare
but can be observed in patients with Ewing sarcoma or patients with metastatic
disease. A pertinent history should note how long a lesion has been present and any
change in it. Rapid growth or change in a lesion favors a malignant etiology.
Physical Exam

Physical exam may reveal a palpable mass. A joint effusion may be observed,
and range of motion of the joint may be limited, with stiffness or pain.
Neurovascular and lymph node examinations are usually normal.
Diagnostic Testing
Imaging

Patients who are suspected to have bone sarcoma should undergo
imaging studies, including plain films, MRI, and biopsy.
Plain films may demonstrate characteristic lesions for bone sarcoma.
Osteosarcoma is associated with destructive lesions showing a motheaten appearance. In addition, a spiculated periosteal reaction and cuff
of periosteal new bone may be seen. Plain films in chondrosarcoma show
lesions with a lobulated appearance with punctate or annular
calcification of cartilage. Ewing sarcoma is associated with an “onion
peel” periosteal reaction and soft tissue mass. Metastatic disease may
be associated with either osteolytic or osteoblastic lesions, depending on
the type of primary malignancy.
MRI is the imaging modality of choice to evaluate the relationship of the
tumor to surrounding structures and determine resectability. CT scan of
the primary site may be considered in place of MRI to demonstrate
cortical destruction more accurately and for evaluation of pelvic tumors.
CT scan of the chest is used to evaluate for pulmonary metastases.
Bone scan helps to evaluate for the local extent of the tumor as well as
to evaluate for other lesions.
Diagnostic Procedures

422

Tissue biopsy, preferably open incisional biopsy, is essential for
diagnosis.
Bone sarcomas are staged using the American Joint Committee on
Cancer staging system based on grade, tumor size, and metastatic
disease as reported in Table 24-3. Adverse prognostic indicators include
elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), elevated alkaline phosphatase,
and an axial primary. Patients with Ewing sarcoma should have bilateral
bone marrow biopsies as part of staging.
TREATMENT
The treatment of bone sarcoma is dependent on histologic subtype.
General principles of local therapy
Surgical excision is the mainstay of treatment for patients with
low-grade bone sarcomas. For high-grade tumors, multimodality
therapy is indicated. As an example, for high-grade osteosarcomas,
preoperative multiagent chemotherapy is followed by surgical removal of
the tumor and then further adjuvant chemotherapy. Physical therapy
and prosthetics are of great importance in these patients because of
the highly invasive nature of the treatment.
The Musculoskeletal Tumor Society and the National Comprehensive
Cancer Network (NCCN) recognize wide excision, either by amputation or
by a limb-salvage procedure, as the recommended surgical approach for
all high-grade bone sarcomas. This type of resection is predicated on
complete tumor removal, effective skeletal reconstruction, and adequate
soft tissue coverage.
Osteosarcoma therapy. The 5-year survival for osteosarcoma with surgery
alone is <20%. This occurs because microscopic metastatic
dissemination is likely to be present in 80% of patients at the time of
diagnosis. The addition of adjuvant chemotherapy has improved survival
for high-grade osteosarcoma, permitting long-term survival as high as
80% is selected patients.
Neoadjuvant and adjuvant chemotherapy. Neoadjuvant
chemotherapy began as a strategy to permit limb-sparing surgery, allows
time for creation of custom-made prosthetics. Since its acceptance, other
advantages have been recognized with this approach. It permits earlier
treatment of occult micrometastatic disease, preventing emergence of
423

resistant clones and potentially allows for the debulking of the primary to
improve chances for limb-sparing surgery.
Chemotherapeutic agents active in osteosarcomas include doxorubicin,
cisplatin, ifosfamide, and high-dose methotrexate with leucovorin rescue.
These agents are typically used in combination to improve response,
although the optimal combination and duration of therapy remain
controversial.
Histologic response to preoperative therapy is recognized as a significant
prognostic factor. Various systems have been developed for grading
histologic response to chemotherapy, but >90% necrosis of tumor cells
is associated with the best prognosis. If the tumor has been resected to
negative margins and had a good histologic response to chemotherapy,
the patient continues on chemotherapy for an additional 2 to 12 cycles.
If the tumor was fully resected but has <90% necrosis, salvage
chemotherapy with agents not used in induction is attempted, but the
effect of this change in chemo-therapy on outcomes is unclear. If the
tumor margins are positive, additional local surgery should be
attempted.

Radiation therapy. Radiation is not routinely used in the therapy of
osteosarcoma, but it may prove helpful in patients who refuse definitive
resection or in palliation of patients with metastatic disease.
424

Management of metastatic disease. Approximately 10% to 20% of
patients with osteosarcoma have evidence of metastatic disease at
presentation. Some of these patients may be candidates for the surgical
resection of pulmonary metastases. For patients with more extensive
metastatic disease, chemotherapy is used to provide control of disease
and palliation of symptoms.
Ewing sarcoma
Therapy for Ewing sarcoma and the related primitive peripheral
neuroectodermal tumors uses a combined-modality approach.26
Treatment of the primary tumor. The optimal treatment for local
tumor control is not well defined. Historically, radiation therapy has been
the mainstay of local therapy, but there has been a recent trend toward
surgery. No prospective randomized trials have been performed to
compare the two modalities, but retrospective data suggest
improvements in local control and survival when surgery is done with a
complete resection of the tumor. Patients with unresectable disease or
positive margins require radiation therapy to improve local control.
Chemotherapy. Before the availability of effective chemotherapeutic
agents, <10% of patients with Ewing sarcoma survived beyond 5 years,
despite the fact that only 15% to 35% of patients with Ewing
sarcoma/primitive peripheral neuroectodermal tumors had evidence of
metastatic disease at presentation. This suggests that many patients
with Ewing sarcoma have occult microscopic dissemination of the disease
at the time of diagnosis. The current standard regimen is to use
vincristine, actinomycin D, and cyclophosphamide (VAC) alternating with
ifosfamide and etoposide (IE).
Recurrent metastatic Ewing sarcoma. In this setting, cure is not a
realistic goal. Palliation and prolongation of survival are more realistic
expectations. Fortunately, aggressive combination chemotherapy (VAC
or IE) and radiation therapy can still lead to prolonged progression-free
survival.

GENERAL PRINCIPLES
In 1954, a family was described with hyperparathyroidism and tumors of the
pituitary and pancreatic islet cells. Now known as multiple endocrine neoplasia type
I (MEN I), it is one of the most well-known hereditary endocrine neoplastic
syndromes. Since then, our knowledge about the genetics and pathology of endocrine
tumors has grown tremendously and has led to various new diagnostic and
therapeutic measures. Endocrine neoplasms are a heterogenous group of tumors.
This chapter will cover the most common types, including pituitary, thyroid,
parathyroid, adrenal cortex, gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine, and
pheochromocytoma, as well as the MEN syndromes.

THYROID CARCINOMA

GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Multiple histologic subtypes of thyroid cancer exist (Table 25-1), and together
they account for >90% of all endocrine malignancies. The normal thyroid is
composed of two main cell types. One is the follicular cell type that concentrates
iodine and produces thyroid hormone. The other cell type is the parafollicular cell
that produces calcitonin. Follicular cells give rise to well-differentiated cancers
(papillary, follicular, and Hürthle) and anaplastic tumors. Parafollicular cells give
rise to medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC).
Epidemiology

428

According to American Cancer Society, 44,670 patients were diagnosed with
thyroid cancer in 2010 and 1,690 died from it. Thyroid cancer is nearly twice as
common in women as in men.
Risk Factors

Previous radiation exposure is the main risk factor with an average lag time of
25 years to cancer presentation. Other risk factors include female sex and family
history. MTCs are different in that radiation exposure is not a risk factor and can
occur sporadically (two-thirds) or in individuals who have either MEN II syndrome
or familial MTC(one-third).
DIAGNOSIS

Clinical Presentation

Initial presentation is typically a solitary thyroid nodule. The majority of
thyroid nodules are benign, and the history and physical exam assist in directing
further investigation. The probability of malignancy is higher if the nodule is found
in men, individuals younger than 15 or older than 60 years, those with a positive
family history, those with other diseases associated with MEN II
(hyperparathyroidism, pheochromocytoma, or mucosal neuromas), and those with
previous radiation exposure. A solitary, firm, immobile nodule or a rapid change in
size is also of greater concern, as are symptoms of hoarseness, dyspnea, dysphagia,
or new Horner syndrome. Symptoms of diarrhea and flushing are occasionally seen
in advanced MTC due to hormone secretion.

429

Physical Examination

Exam should evaluate nodule size, firmness, mobility, and local
lymphadenopathy. Nodules <1 cm in a patient without other risk factors may be
followed with a repeat exam in 6 to 12 months. However, nodules >1 cm or a nodule
of any size in a patient with one of the previously listed risk factors warrants further
evaluation.
Diagnostic Testing

430

Ultrasound of the thyroid is recommended; central hypervascularity,
irregular borders, and/or microcalcifications suggest malignancy. Fineneedle aspiration (FNA) is combined with ultrasound as the initial
approach to establish diagnosis. If malignancy cannot be excluded by
FNA, a lobectomy is usually performed to obtain adequate tissue for
determining the correct diagnosis.
Radioactive isotope scans and serologic testing with thyroid-stimulating
hormone (TSH) and serum thyroglobulin assays are only useful in
postoperative follow-up; they are not useful in making the diagnosis of
thyroid malignancy, as most nodules are hypoactive regardless of
presence or absence of malignancy. Calcitonin levels, however, should
be checked at presentation and at follow-up exams for patients with
MTC, as calcitonin serves as a sensitive tumor marker. In addition, those
with MTC need to be evaluated for the RET proto-oncogene mutation,
and a 24-hour urine for vanillylmandelic acid, catecholamines, and
metanephrines is needed to evaluate for possible pheochromocytoma as
part of MEN II syndrome.
Imaging

Once a diagnosis of malignancy is made, all individuals should have a chest xray to evaluate for metastases to the lung. An extensive staging workup is necessary
only in anaplastic thyroid cancers, as they are often metastatic at presentation.
Patients with anaplastic tumors should receive complete imaging of the neck with
ultrasound or MRI and have a contrast-enhanced CT scan of the chest. Consideration
should also be given to abdominal imaging with CT or MRI.
Staging

The staging of thyroid cancer is different from other malignancies. In addition to
tumor size, it also depends on tumor histology and the patient’s age at presentation.
For example, in patients <45 years old, well-differentiated papillary or follicular
cell carcinomas are never classified higher than stage II. On the other hand, all
anaplastic tumors are classified as stage IV regardless of anatomic extent due to
their aggressive nature and high potential for metastasizing. In MTC, staging
information comes from evaluation of the total thyroidectomy and cervical lymph
node dissection.
TREATMENT

431

Treatment of the three main types of thyroid cancer varies significantly.
Radioactive iodine, external-beam radiation, surgery, and systemic chemotherapy
each have their role in comprehensive therapeutic regimens.
Well-differentiated thyroid carcinoma (i.e., papillary, follicular,
and Hürthle) is mainly treated by surgical resection in all stages.
Patients younger than 40 years have an excellent prognosis with
thyroidectomy alone. Factors increasing the chance of recurrence include
advanced age and tumor size >1 cm. For these patients, a total
thyroidectomy is recommended; otherwise, unilateral lobectomy can be
considered for smaller tumors. Recurrent laryngeal nerve damage
resulting in hoarseness is an uncommon complication of thyroid
lobectomy. A total thyroidectomy carries the additional risk of
hypocalcemia from hypoparathyroidism. In more advanced disease,
dissection of the central and lateral cervical lymph nodes should be
considered.
Radioiodine therapy with 131I induces cytotoxicity and is the key
adjuvant therapeutic agent. External-beam radiation therapy, on the
other hand, rarely has a role in differentiated thyroid carcinomas. There
are two main indications for use of 131I. The first is to ablate residual
normal thyroid tissue post–total thyroidectomy to improve the sensitivity
of subsequent diagnostic 131I scans in detecting recurrence. The second
is to treat metastatic disease and destroy microscopic malignant foci.
Follow-up imaging with 131I determines treatment efficacy by revealing
residual normal tissue as well as carcinoma. Treatment ends when there
is no further radioactive iodine uptake present.
Adjuvant hormonal therapy with exogenous thyroid hormone is also
routinely used in well-differentiated thyroid carcinomas to suppress TSH,
since both normal and neoplastic thyroid tissue depend on TSH for
growth. In addition, thyroid hormone is also necessary to prevent
symptoms of hypothyroidism. One should keep in mind, however, the
potential side effects of higher rates of bone loss and an increased
incidence of atrial fibrillation. Suppression of TSH to undetectable levels
for the initial 5 to 10 years is reasonable. After this time, if there is no
evidence of recurrent disease, exogenous thyroid hormone
supplementation may be decreased, such that the TSH levels rise to the
lower limits of normal.
432

Chemotherapeutic agents are rarely administered because they are
typically less effective and have a worse side-effect profile than
radioactive iodine.
MTC is sporadic in most cases, but ~20% of cases are part of inherited
tumor syndromes (MEN IIA and IIB and familial MTC). This possibility
makes ruling out a RET proto-oncogene mutation, hyperparathyroidism,
and pheochromocytoma essential to the initial preoperative
management, along with calcitonin measurement. Total thyroidectomy
with bilateral central neck dissection is the mainstay of therapy for MTC
because of the high frequency of bilateral disease. Although MTC is
somewhat indolent in its progression, no effective systemic
chemotherapy regimens exist, and MTC cells take up radioactive iodine
poorly. For this reason, patients with genetic predisposition to the
disease (i.e., RET mutations) should be highly encouraged to undergo
prophylactic total thyroidectomy with central lymph node dissection.
Complications of local MTC invasion mirror those of anaplastic tumors,
yet progression is less rapid. Doxorubicin is the most effective cytotoxic
chemotherapeutic agent, but an objective response is <40%, with no
patients having a complete response.
Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma is poorly responsive to therapy and is
often locally invasive, if not metastatic, at the time of presentation.
These poor prognostic features mean that this histology is always
classified as stage IV at diagnosis regardless of size, grade, node
involvement, or metastasis. The invasive nature makes tumor resection
difficult or even impossible. At initial presentation, the tumor may
encompass the carotid arteries, esophagus, and/or trachea. Recurrent or
superior laryngeal nerve damage may also occur. The complications of
local invasion account for the major morbidity of this cancer, often
leading patients to require gastrostomy tubes or a tracheostomy.
Resection. If imaging reveals limited disease, resection should be
pursued for improved local control and delay of complications, although
survival is not altered.
Radiation/Chemotherapy. Radioactive iodine is rarely taken up by
anaplastic carcinoma cells, so external-beam radiation therapy is a
necessary component of treatment. Administration should be undertaken
concurrently with systemic radiosensitizing chemotherapy. Doxorubicin is
the most commonly used agent.
433

End-stage care typically includes managing local complications, with
~50% of patients dying from airway obstruction.
FOLLOW-UP
For routine follow-up of well-differentiated thyroid carcinoma, physical exam,
TSH, thyroglobulin level measurement, and chest x-ray are recommended twice
yearly for 4 years, then once yearly for 10 years. Thyroglobulin levels are expected
to be <5 ng/mL if complete thyroid ablation has been successful. For MTC, serum
calcitonin and carcinoembryonic antigen levels should initially be followed at 2 to 3
months postoperatively, and then yearly. Abnormal serum markers should trigger
diagnostic imaging evaluation.
PROGNOSIS
Well-differentiated thyroid carcinomas have an excellent prognosis. Cure rates
reach nearly 100% at 10 years, even with capsular invasion, as long as there is no
vascular involvement. The two most important predictors of mortality are age (>45)
and tumor stage at the time of initial therapy. Relative survival at 10 years for
papillary, follicular, and Hürthle cell carcinomas is 93%, 85%, and 76%,
respectively. Anaplastic tumors carry a grim prognosis, often leading rapidly to
death within the first few years after diagnosis regardless of treatment. MTCs have
5-year survival rates >80% in stage I and II disease but <40% in stage III or IV
disease.
Thirty percent of patients will have a recurrence, the majority locally, with
distant recurrence mainly involving the lungs.

PARATHYROID CARCINOMA

GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Although adenomas of the parathyroid glands are a common endocrine
abnormality, parathyroid carcinoma is quite rare. Primary hyperparathyroidism is
categorized pathologically into three groups: single parathyroid adenoma (83% to
434

85%), multi-glandular hyperplasia (15%), and parathyroid carcinoma (0.5% to 3%).
Unlike benign hyperparathyroidism, which is found primarily in the postmenopausal
female population, parathyroid carcinoma is found equally in both genders at
younger ages. With an incidence of only 0.015 in 100,000, parathyroid cancer is
classified as one of the rarest human cancers. Although no etiologic causes are
known, parathyroid cancer is seen in the autosomal dominant disease of MEN I.
DIAGNOSIS
Patients with parathyroid carcinoma often present with either hypercalcemia or
a neck mass. On physical exam, 30% to 50% of patients with parathyroid carcinoma
have palpable masses in the central neck region. A hyperfunctional parathyroid
tumor leads to excessive production of parathyroid hormone and, ultimately, the
clinical syndrome of primary hyperparathyroidism. Clinical signs and symptoms
include fatigue, renal stones, bone disease, and neuromuscular/neuropsychiatric
disturbances related to hypercalcemia. Grossly elevated calcium levels lead to
nausea, vomiting, polyuria, and dehydration. Cytologic examination of a needle
aspirate is considered an unreliable criterion for diagnosis of malignancy. Definitive
diagnosis of parathyroid carcinoma is made in the operating room, where local
invasion and metastasis can be assessed.
TREATMENT

The mainstay of treatment is surgical exploration of the neck and
complete en bloc resection of the tumor along with the
ipsilateral thyroid lobe and central cervical lymph nodes.1 There
is no proven role for adjuvant chemotherapy or radiation therapy.
Likewise, the only effective therapy for recurrent or meta-static disease
is complete resection.
The management of severe hypercalcemia includes saline hydration,
furosemide diuresis, and bisphosphonates. Octreotide and calcimimetic
agents are occasionally used to lower calcium in patients refractory to
other therapeutic interventions.
PROGNOSIS

435

Hypercalcemia is the major cause of morbidity and mortality. The prognosis for
parathyroid carcinoma depends on the adequacy of the initial en bloc resection. The
most common site of recurrence is local followed by lung, liver, and bone, in order
of decreasing incidence. Early recurrence correlates with death from the disease.
The overall survival is ~85% at 5 years and 50% to 70% at 10 years.2

PITUITARY NEOPLASMS

GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Pituitary neoplasms are rare endocrine malignancies that arise from epithelial
origin in the adenohypophysis. Pituitary adenomas account for 10% to 15% of
intracranial tumors. Previously classified by histopathology (acidophilic,
basophilic, chromophobic), pituitary adenomas are now classified by the hormones
they secrete, that is, prolactin, growth hormone, adrenal corticotropin hormone
(ACTH), gonadotropins, and TSH. Tumors that do not secrete hormones above
physiologic levels are termed nonfunctional adenomas.
Epidemiology

Incidence peaks in the third and fourth decades of life. In general, males and
females are affected equally, with the exception of some subtypes, such as ACTH
and prolactin-secreting adenomas, which are more common in females.
DIAGNOSIS

Clinical Presentation

Initial symptoms include headache, visual disturbance, and increased
intracranial pressure, as well as syndromes related to the type of hormone secreted
(Cushing’s syndrome, acromegaly, hirsutism, hyperprolactinemia, or
hyperthyroidism).
Diagnostic Testing

Initial evaluation involves a dedicated gadolinium-enhanced MRI of the
436

pituitary and laboratory evaluation for active adenomas with a panel consisting of
growth hormone (GH), insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), prolactin (PRL), TSH,
free T4, T3, ACTH, cortisol, luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone
(FSH), and testosterone. Diagnosis is made on imaging, substantiated by hormone
levels in active adenomas, and, when appropriate, confirmed pathologically by
transsphenoidal biopsy or resection. No TNM staging classification exists for these
rare tumors, and prognostic markers include levels of hormone secreted, size of
tumor, and extent of suprasellar extension.
TREATMENT
Management of pituitary adenomas depends on the type, but in general,
transsphenoidal surgical resection is the favored curative approach. The exceptions
are prolactin-secreting microadenomas, which are managed by dopamine agonists,
or inactive adenomas, which remain stable in size on serial imaging. The goals of
surgery are to alleviate mass effect while preserving pituitary function and abating
endocrine hyperactivity. Postoperative management depends on the type of pituitary
adenoma.
Prolactin-Secreting Adenomas

Prolactin-secreting adenomas are the most commonly diagnosed
pituitary tumor, representing ~30% of cases. Symptoms of
hyperprolactinemia include galactorrhea and hypogonadism
(oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea, dry vaginal mucosa, sterility, decreased
libido, and impotence).3 Prolactinomas are usually slow-growing
microadenomas in premenopausal women, but can grow to a larger size
(macroadenomas) in men and postmenopausal females. Macroadenomas
can cause mass effect, classically manifested by visual disturbances
(bitemporal hemianopsia) and headaches.
The differential diagnosis of hyperprolactinemia includes pregnancy,
prolactin-stimulating drugs, hypothyroidism, and renal failure. The
definitive diagnosis requires radiographic evidence of an adenoma and a
persistently elevated prolactin level (>200 ng/mL in females and >100
ng/mL in males), with the other etiologies of hyperprolactinemia having
been ruled out.
Treatment of prolactinomas is dependent on size. Microadenomas are
treated medically, since most do not increase in size and surgery is
437

rarely curative. Medical treatment is achieved with dopamine agonists
(e.g., bromocriptine), where the response rates are 70% to 80% for
tumor shrinkage and 80% to 90% for restoration of ovulation. In cases
where dopamine agonist therapy is not tolerated (~30% of cases) or
fertility is not a concern, oral contraceptives containing estrogen and
progesterone can be used to treat the symptoms of hypogonadism. In
cases of macroadenomas with significant suprasellar involvement or in
pregnancy (which stimulates growth of adenomas), surgery or radiation
therapy can be used, often in combination with dopamine agonists.
Follow-up should include yearly prolactin levels. If prolactin increases to
>250 ng/mL or neurological symptoms develop, repeat MRI is indicated.
For patients with macroadenomas, visual field testing and MRI at 6
months after commencement of therapy should be performed. When
prolactin levels are normalized for 2 years and at least 50% tumor
reduction is observed, a trial of tapering the dopamine agonist may be
considered.
Growth Hormone–Secreting Adenomas

Growth hormone–secreting adenomas account for 30% of pituitary
adenomas. Growth hormone excess results in acromegaly (coarse facial
features, macro-glossia, and acral growth). Growth hormone leads to an
increase in IGF-1, which affects bone and tissue growth and can
ultimately lead to organomegaly, hypertension, cardiomyopathy,
arthropathies, and restrictive lung diseases. Symptoms include
arthralgias, oily skin, hyperhidrosis, headaches, and fatigue.
The diagnosis is suggested by a physical exam showing acromegaly,
elevated IGF-1 levels (preferred over fasting GH because the levels are
more stable), oral glucose suppression test failing to suppress IGF-1,
elevated GH, and a pituitary adenoma evident on MRI.
The treatment of choice is a transsphenoidal resection. In patients not
eligible for surgery, external-beam radiation may be used. Medical
treatment with dopamine agonists or somatostatin analogs such as
octreotide are not curative, but may be used for symptomatic control of
acromegaly.
Follow-up should include monitoring GH and IGF-1 levels. Monitoring for
hypopituitarism after radiation is also essential.
Adrenal Corticotropin Hormone–Secreting Adenomas

438

These less common pituitary adenomas result in Cushing’s disease.
Cushing’s disease is more common in women. The clinical presentation is
most often a result of an endocrinopathy and less commonly secondary
to a mass effect. Increased ACTH results in adrenal hyperplasia and
hypercortisolism. Hypercortisolism results in centripetal obesity, moon
facies, buffalo hump, hirsutism, abdominal striae, and acne (i.e.,
Cushing’s syndrome). Clinical signs include hypertension, bone loss,
myopathies, diabetes, and psychiatric disorders.
Diagnosis is made by confirming hypercortisolism with 24-hour urinary
cortisol. The pituitary origin of cortisol is demonstrated by failure of the
low-dose dexamethasone suppression test to suppress serum cortisol to
<10 μg/dL. Finally, serum ACTH should be elevated to rule out an
adrenal adenoma. Ectopic ACTH syndrome is excluded if the high-dose
dexamethasone suppression test results in reduction of cortisol levels to
<50% of baseline. If the above laboratory testing is inconclusive, inferior
petrosal sinus sampling for ACTH can be performed to confirm the
pituitary etiology. Imaging studies are less reliable, as 50% of ACTHsecreting adenomas may not be detectable by MRI; nonetheless, MRI
remains essential to guiding therapy and is performed in all cases.
Treatment of choice is transsphenoidal resection, with cure rates
ranging from 76% to 94%. External-beam radiation can be used for poor
surgical candidates or as adjuvant therapy to surgery. Medical therapy
with ketoconazole or mitotane can be used for symptom control in those
unable to tolerate surgery or in relapsed cases.
Follow-up requires replacement hormonal therapy for up to 1 year after
surgery and monitoring for hypopituitarism after radiation.
Gonadotropin-Secreting Adenomas and Nonsecreting Pituitary Adenomas

These adenomas account for 30% of pituitary tumors. They are
associated with an older population. Most are nonsecretory, but
demonstrate secretory granules containing FSH and LH. Clinical
presentation typically presents secondary to a mass effect, with
symptoms of headaches, visual changes, and hypopituitarism.
Diagnosis is suggested by increased LH and FSH and by MRI findings of
a macroadenoma. Postmenopausal women may have naturally elevated
FSH and LH, and diagnosis relies on final surgical pathology.
The treatment is primarily transsphenoidal resection. Adjuvant
439

external-beam radiation therapy may be considered in patients with
residual tumor on imaging postoperatively. Follow-up several months
postoperatively with repeat MRI is essential since most tumors are
nonsecretory.
TSH-Secreting Adenomas

TSH-secreting adenomas are the least common pituitary tumor,
comprising ~1% of pituitary adenomas. Clinical presentation is typically
with symptoms of hyperthyroidism (heat intolerance, diarrhea, weight
loss, or exophthalmos) or mass effect.
Diagnosis is made by demonstrating increased TSH despite elevated T4
and T3. MRI may confirm the presence of an adenoma.
Treatment is primarily transsphenoidal resection. Adjuvant externalbeam radiation is used in refractory cases. Palliative medical therapy
with octreotide has been used in refractory cases, with response rates of
90%. Follow-up requires monitoring of TSH, T4, and T3 levels.

ADRENAL CORTICAL TUMORS

GENERAL PRINCIPLES
The majority are benign, nonfunctioning adenomas found incidentally on imaging.
Others are benign hormone-secreting adenomas causing diseases such as Cushing’s.
Only 50% of adrenal tumors are endocrinologically active. The third type of adrenal
tumor is an adrenal cortical carcinoma that is a very rare and extremely aggressive
tumor type.
DIAGNOSIS

Clinical Presentation

Adrenal “incidentalomas” can be found on 1% to 3% of CT scans of the
abdomen. The differential diagnosis includes benign adenomas and
metastases. The chance of malignancy is directly related to the size of
440

the mass (<3cm, benign; >6 cm, malignant), with most carcinomas
presenting as large masses.
Adrenal adenomas can secrete cortisol, sex hormones, or aldosterone, or
can be inactive. The clinical presentation is dependent on the
predominant hormone secreted. The most common clinical presentation
is Cushing’s syndrome, which results from a cortisol excess. Sex hormone
excess can lead to acne, oligomenor-rhea, and virilization/hirsutism in
women and feminization in men. Rarely, these carcinomas may produce
aldosterone, resulting in hypertension and hypokalemia.
Diagnostic Testing

Initial evaluation involves staging with imaging with a CT of the
abdomen and pelvis, and determination of hormone levels, which are
used to monitor for recurrence and progression.
The definitive diagnosis is obtained by surgical pathology. High urinary
free cortisol and serum cortisol, low ACTH, and lack of suppression in a
high-dose dexamethasone suppression test occur in the instance of
cortisol-secreting carcinoma. Virilizing sex hormone–secreting
carcinomas demonstrate high levels of testosterone, androstenedione,
and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S) while feminizing tumors
demonstrate high estradiol levels. Some tumors are nonsecretory, and
definitive diagnosis relies on pathologic diagnosis.
The staging of adrenal carcinoma depends on tumor size, nodal
involvement, and presence of distant metastasis. Tumors <5 cm with no
nodal involvement are stage I; those >5 cm without nodal involvement,
stage II; those with nodal involvement, stage III; and those with distant
metastasis, stage IV.
TREATMENT

Surgical resection is the treatment of choice, even in advanced
disease. Debulking of the tumor and metastectomy are often considered.
Adjuvant chemotherapy can be considered in advanced disease, but it is
thought to be minimally effective, as there is not enough evidence to
support any single regimen.
In patients ineligible for surgery, most chemotherapeutic regimens will
441

include mitotane, which selectively targets the adrenal cortex and
results in selective chemical ablation.4 Overall response rate to mitotane
is ~33%, but its effect on overall and disease-free survival has not been
conclusively determined. Other medical therapies aimed at palliating
symptoms include ketoconazole and aminoglutethimide.
Finally, adjuvant external-beam radiation therapy may also be effective
for local control after resection or for symptomatic metastasis.
PROGNOSIS
The prognosis of adrenal carcinoma depends on initial stage and resectability.
For surgically resectable tumors, the median overall survival is almost 6 years, but
with medical therapy alone <10% of patients live to 6 years. Follow-up with repeat
CT scans and hormone levels at 6 month intervals is recommended.

DIFFUSE ENDOCRINE SYSTEM TUMORS
Some endocrinologically active tumors are not localized to any one organ, but
share the common embryonic origin of the neural crest and neuroectoderm. These
include gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, pheochromocytomas, and the
MEN syndromes.

GASTROENTEROPANCREATIC NEUROENDOCRINE
TUMORS

GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Tumors of the gastroenteropancreatic axis are classified according to their
secretory products: insulinoma, gastrinoma, somatostatinoma, glucagonoma,
vasoactive intestinal peptide-oma (VIPoma), and carcinoid. Some are nonsecretory
and classified as extrapulmonary small-cell carcinomas. Half of neuroendocrine
tumors are of the carcinoid variant, followed by gastrinomas, insulinomas, VIPomas,
and glucagonomas, in order of decreasing incidence.

442

DIAGNOSIS
Most neuroendocrine tumors are malignant and are commonly identified at the
time of metastatic disease, with the exception of insulinomas, which are slow
growing. Clinical presentation depends on the hormones secreted and the site of
disease. The initial laboratory analysis should focus on specific hormones
associated with those clinical symptoms as outlined in Table 25-2.

443

TREATMENT
Tumor localization is essential for successful management of limited disease. CT
and MRI may detect larger tumors, but often scintigraphy or angiography with
venous hormone sampling may be required to localize tumors. Therapy varies from
surgical resection for localized tumors, to medical therapies and dietary changes to
palliate symptoms, to chemotherapy and arterial embolization. Chemotherapy has
variable activity depending on the type of gastroenteropancreatic tumor. Typical
agents used include 5-FU, streptozotocin, doxorubicin, and dacarbazine. Octreotide
is commonly used in the treatment of gastroenteropancreatic malignancies for
symptom relief (e.g., flushing, wheezing, and diarrhea); it also has a direct inhibitory
effect on tumor growth and is used in the perioperative setting as suppressive
therapy.

CARCINOID TUMORS

GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Carcinoid tumors are the most common neuroendocrine tumors, with a yearly
incidence of 1.5 in 100,000 in the United States. Benign and malignant tumors occur
at approximately equal frequency, and either type may be symptomatic. They can
secrete various vasoactive substances, including histamine, serotonin,
catecholamines, and prostaglandins. The small bowel is the most common location
for these tumors, but they may occur in the appendix, colon, rectum, lung, stomach, or
ovary as well.5 Symptomatic carcinoid tumors usually result from small bowel
tumors with metastases to the liver and do not occur with rectal carcinoid. Carcinoid
syndrome is due to excessive production of serotonin and other bioactive
compounds that then have direct access to the systemic circulation.
DIAGNOSIS

Clinical Presentation

Appendiceal and small(<1 cm) rectal tumors rarely metastasize, cause
444

symptoms, or affect survival. Small bowel tumors are more likely to be
problematic. One-third of small intestine tumors are multicentric, and the
chance of metastases increases with increased tumor size (tumors >2
cm have a high rate of metastasis). In general, the progression of small
intestinal carcinoid tumors is indolent. However, once metastasis of
tumor cells occurs, prognosis is considerably worse. Five-year survival
with localized disease, with only nodal involvement, and, finally, with
liver metastases is ~95%, 65%, and 20%, respectively. Urinary 5hydroxyindoleacetic acid levels inversely correlate with survival.
Approximately 40% of carcinoid tumors found in living patients are
hormonally active, leading to carcinoid syndrome in 10% of cases.
This syndrome rarely occurs without liver metastasis. Symptoms may
include facial flushing and edema, abdominal cramping and diarrhea,
bronchospasm, hypotension, and cardiac valvular lesions (typically on
the tricuspid and/or pulmonic valve if the tumor secretions originate in
the bowel). Alcohol, stress, or exercise may precipitate symptoms.
Tumors that are not endocrinologically active can also cause devastating
effects such as bowel obstruction, appendicitis, or painful
livermetastases.
Diagnostic Testing

Anelevated 24-hour urinary 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid level is
often used for diagnosis, but it is not useful for detecting carcinoid at the
early stages when it is curable. Levels >25 mg/d are the typical finding
(normal value of excretion is <9 mg/d). Patients should avoid excessive
intake of nuts, bananas, avocados, and pineapples for ~2 days before
testing, as these may result in erroneously high levels.
Plasma chromogranin A level may also be a useful test with a high
sensitivity and without significant variability or need for a 24-hour urine
collection.
Routine blood tests, with attention to liver function tests, hepatic and
upper gastrointestinal system imaging, a chest x-ray, and eventual tissue
acquisition should all be part of the workup. If available, somatostatin
receptor scintigraphy is a useful imaging test. There is no accepted
staging system for carcinoid.
Finally, pathologic diagnosis is confirmed with positive stains for
chromogranin, synaptophysin, and neuron-specificenolase.
445

TREATMENT

For localized disease, surgical resection is the standard curative
modality, with a 5-year overall survival of 70% to 90%. In metastatic
disease, overall survival is ~2 years, with the focus of therapy on
palliating symptoms both surgically and medically. As survival with
untreated carcinoid tumors can exceed 10 years, therapy is usually
focused on controlling symptoms. Dietary tryptophan restriction, along
with serotonin antagonists and other symptom-controlling drugs, is the
initial mainstay of therapy.
The somatostatin analog octreotide, used at doses of 100 to 600 mcg
SC/d in two to four divided doses, is effective at symptom alleviation in
nearly 90% of patients. A depot formulation of octreotide available as
monthly dosing has become standardized. Histamine blockers,
prochlorperazine, and cyprohepta-dine may decrease flushing. Atropine,
diphenoxylate, and cyproheptadine can be used for diarrhea. Monoamine
oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) are contraindicated.
Surgery can be risky, as anesthesia often precipitates attacks.
However, resection is indicated and highly successful in localized
carcinoid tumors. Preoperative administration of octreotide is necessary
to prevent carcinoid crisis.
Radiation and various chemotherapy regimens are typically reserved
for symptomatic control of metastases in advanced disease.

PHEOCHROMOCYTOMA

GENERAL PRINCIPLES

Pheochromocytomas arise from chromaffin cells primarily in the adrenal
medulla (90%), although they can also arise along the aorta, within the
carotid body, intracardiac, and even within the urinary bladder. The “rule
of 10” is also useful in recognizing general features of
pheochromocytomas: 10% are malignant, 10% are extra-adrenal, and
10% are bilateral. This widespread distribution reflects the location of
446

chromaffin cells associated with the sympathetic ganglia.
Pheochromocytoma is present in only 0.1% of hypertensive patients who
undergo urinary catecholamine quantification.
The incidence of malignancy in pheochromocytomas ranges from 5% to
45% in several series. Extra-adrenal tumors are more commonly
malignant. Pheochromocytomas are associated with several inherited
disorders. Bilateral adrenal medullary pheochromocytomas are elements
of the inherited MEN IIA and MEN IIB neuroendocrine syndromes.
Although ~25% of patients with von Hippel–Lindau disease develop
pheochromocytomas, <1% of patients with neurofibromatosis and Von
Recklinghausen disease are found to have the tumor.
DIAGNOSIS

Clinical Presentation

The most common presenting complaint is severe hypertension unrelated to
physical or emotional stress. The production of catecholamines results in the clinical
symptoms of episodic or sustained hypertension and anxiety attacks.
Pheochromocytomas have been known to produce other hormones, including ACTH,
somatostatin, calcitonin, oxytocin, and vasopressin. Classically, patients describe
spells of hypertension, palpitations, headaches, and diaphoresis. Other presenting
findings include lactic acidosis, hypovolemia, and unexplained fever. Clinically, the
cluster of symptoms can be recalled by remembering the five Ps: pain, pressure,
palpitation, perspiration, and pallor. However, it should be appreciated that many
patients do not exhibit these “classic” episodes and may have persistent
hypertension, rather than episodic.
Diagnostic Testing

Traditionally, diagnosis has been based on a 24-hour measurement
of catecholamines and metabolites in the urine, including
vanillylmandelic acid and metanephrines. New data suggest that a
random plasma metanephrine level is extremely sensitive (~99%)
in diagnosing pheochromocytoma and is an excellent choice for initial
screening. Although rarely used in clinical practice today, the clonidine
suppression test has been used in the past. Normally, clonidine
447

suppresses plasma levels of epinephrine and norepinephrine. In the
presence of pheochromocytomas, no such suppression is observed.
Localization of a pheochromocytoma is accomplished by chest and
abdominal imaging with CT or MRI. Nuclear scanning after the
administration of labeled metaiodobenzylguanidine can be done if the
tumor is not localized by CT or MRI. Metaiodobenzylguanidine is
structurally similar to norepinephrine and is selectively taken up by
adrenergic tissue.
TREATMENT

After diagnosis, tumor localization and operative preparation are
indicated, as surgical resection represents the mainstay of curative
therapy.
Preoperative alpha-adrenergic blockade is necessary for patients
with pheochromocytomas. Traditionally, phenoxybenzamine has been
used to control hypertension. Propranolol may be used to control
tachycardia, but must always follow alpha-adrenergic blockade to avoid
hypertensive exacerbation due to unopposed vasoconstriction.
Intraoperative hypertensive episodes are controlled with alphaadrenergic blockers or sodium nitroprusside.
Malignant pheochromocytomas are difficult to distinguish from
benign pheochromocytomas by pathology alone. Natural history,
secondary tumor sites, and recurrence help determine the nature of the
pheochromocytoma. Aggressive disease may require combination
chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and dacarbazine.
Routine follow-up consists of blood pressure measurements and urinary
catecholamines in addition to regularly scheduled CT, MRI, or
metaiodobenzylguanidine scanning to monitor for recurrence.

MULTIPLE ENDOCRINE NEOPLASIA SYNDROMES
MEN syndromes are a group of rare genetic disorders that confer an increased
risk of malignancy of endocrine tissues. These disorders are grouped by the major
cell type of malignancy that the affected patients are at risk for developing (Table
25-3). They share a common cell of origin (amine precursor uptake and
448

decarboxylation [APUD] neuroendocrine cells) and are inherited in an autosomal
dominant pattern.
Multiple endocrine neoplasia I (Werner syndrome)
This syndrome has high penetrance, with parathyroid glands most
frequently involved. One-third of gastrinomas are associated with MEN I,
and pituitary adenomas can also be discovered. The MEN I gene locus
has been mapped to 11q13 and codes for a tumor suppressor gene.
Inheritance of the mutation is autosomal dominant. Morbidity and
mortality are predominately related to duodenopancreatic malignancies.
Treatment is directed by sites of tumor involvement. Patients require
close follow-up for evidence of additional sites of involvement in the
pituitary, parathyroid, pancreas, duodenum, adrenals, thymus, and
lungs.

Multiple endocrine neoplasia IIA (Sipple syndrome) and IIB
MEN II syndromes demonstrate an autosomal dominant inheritance of an
activating mutation of the RET proto-oncogene, located on chromosome
10. Nearly all patients develop medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC),
which is typically multifocal and bilateral and occurs at a young age.
449

Other features of these syndromes are expressed variably and are
reported in Table 25-3. Treatment is directed by sites of tumor
involvement. All patients presenting with MTC should be considered for
genetic screening for RET proto-oncogene mutations. Furthermore, all
patients with MTC should be evaluated for possible
pheochromocytoma before undergoing thyroidectomy to avoid a lifethreatening hypertensive crisis.
Familial non-multiple endocrine neoplasia medullary thyroid carcinoma
(FMTC)
This disease is also associated with an autosomal dominant inheritance
of the RET proto-oncogene; however, these patients develop MTC
without other abnormalities associated with MEN II syndromes. Patients
with MEN IIA and FMTC almost invariably develop MTC at an
early age, and therefore, prophylactic thyroidectomy should be
considered in patients with a known mutation.

Prostate cancer is the most common non-cutaneous cancer among men in the
United States and is the second leading cause of cancer death in men after lung
cancer. The American Cancer Society estimated that there would be 217,730 new
cases and 32,050 deaths from prostate cancer in 2010. One man in 6 would get
prostate cancer during his lifetime and one in 36 die of this disease. The course is
often indolent and the average age at presentation is late in life. As a result of
widespread screening, most patients today are diagnosed with asymptomatic,
prostate-confined disease.
Risk Factors

Age is the most significant risk factor, and 2 out of every 3 prostate cancers are
found in men older than 65 years, as per the American Cancer Society. Increased
risk is also conferred to patients with a positive family history and those of African
American descent. High-fat and red meat diets appear to correlate positively
with prostate cancer development. Benign prostatic hypertrophy is not a risk
factor.
Prevention

No method of prevention has been found to be effective in clinical trials. 5Alpha-reductase enzyme inhibitors, finasteride1 and dutasteride2, have been found to
451

temporarily shrink tumors that probably would not have been fatal, without being
able to prevent cancer from development. Furthermore, they suppress levels of
prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and may provide a false sense of security that may
have contributed to finding of higher grade tumors found in patients treated with
finasteride compared with placebo.
DIAGNOSIS

Screening for prostate cancer in asymptomatic patients remains
controversial. US death rates from prostate cancer have been falling
since introduction of PSA testing. However, it’s unclear whether the
harms of testing outweigh the benefits for the general asymptomatic
population. Preliminary results from the US Prostate, Lung, Colorectal,
and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial showed no mortality benefit
from combined screening with PSA testing and digital rectal exam during
a medical follow-up of 11 years.3 Meanwhile, preliminary results from the
European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC)
Trial noted that 1410 men needed to be screened and 48 needed to be
treated to prevent one prostate cancer– related death in a 10-year
period.4 These trials as well as several others, such as Prostate Cancer
Intervention Versus Observation Trial (PIVOT) in the United States, are
ongoing and the final results are pending.
The American Cancer Society does not currently recommend routine PSA
testing and recommends individualized discussion between the patient
and his physician. US Preventive Services Task Force most recent
recommendations from 2008 recommend against screening for men
older than 75 years and conclude there is insufficient data to recommend
for or against routine testing for younger men. As of November 2009, the
American Urological Association continues to recommend PSA testing
starting at age 40 years.
Clinical Presentation

Often patients with prostate cancer are asymptomatic. However, obstructive
symptoms as well as dysuria, back pain, and hematuria can be initial presenting
symptoms. In some cases, disease may become evident only after investigation of
metastatic symptoms such as spinal cord compression or bone pain, which is the
favored site of metastasis.
452

Physical Exam

Carcinoma of the prostate can develop within the posterior surfaces of the lateral
lobes, which are palpable during the digital rectal exam (DRE). Sensation of hard
irregular nodules on the DRE is characteristic. Deeper or more anterior lesions,
however, are not detectable on routine DRE. One should also recognize that
detection sensitivity also varies significantly between examiners owing to
differences in experience and technique. Trials for detecting early disease suggest
that the physical exam, or even an ultrasonography (U/S) exam, is less sensitive than
measurement of PSA.5 On occasion, disease disseminates to the lymph nodes,
causing evidence of scrotal or lower-extremity lymphedema on physical exam.
Diagnostic Testing
Laboratories

Because signs and symptoms are often nonspecific or nonexistent, diagnosis is
often suggested by use of serum markers. The relatively high sensitivity (70% to
80%) and noninvasive nature of the total serum PSA assay have made it the most
often used test. Although PSA levels fall on a continuum, a normal level is
considered to be <4 ng/mL. Of note, levels typically elevate with age and following
prostatic massage, and they can also be elevated in patients with benign prostatic
hypertrophy and prostatitis. On the other hand, men with high Gleason score tumors
may have tumors so undifferentiated that they do not synthesize large amounts of
PSA. In the general population, sensitivity of PSA >4 has been estimated at 70% to
80%, while the specificity is estimated to be about 60% to 70%.6 Perhaps the most
important feature of PSA testing is the ability to follow its change over time (PSA
velocity).
Imaging

Although transrectal ultrasound has been used for screening and staging in
some situations, its greatest use is to guide prostatic biopsies. Bone scan is useful in
identifying bone metastasis and is recommended for men with PSA >20. CT can
supplement clinical evaluation and should also be used with PSA >20 or T3/T4
stage tumors to evaluate for lymph node involvement. Role of PET and MRI is not
yet clear.
Diagnostic Procedures

Biopsy is essential for diagnosis. The sensitivity can also be increased when
453

more needle cores are obtained. A minimum of 6 cores is standard, although many
patients routinely have 8 to 12 cores/biopsy sessions. Histologic grade is an
important determinant of disease course and patient survival. Adenocarcinomas
represent >95% of prostate cancers and are graded histologically using the Gleason
scoring system. This system takes the two most predominant histologic patterns in
the area of the tumor and assigns each a number from 1 to 5. These numbers are then
added together to give the total score. Higher scores correlate with more poorly
differentiated tumors and worse prognosis. Squamous and transitional cell tumors
make up the majority of the remaining prostate tumors, with another important subset
being the high-grade neuroendocrine or small-cell tumors.
TREATMENT
The key determinants in considering the optimal treatment of prostate cancer are
estimates of life expectancy and risk of cancer progression. The risk of cancer
progression can be estimated using the pathologic stage, which is determined by the
clinical stage (based on DRE), preoperative PSA, and biopsy Gleason score. The
National Comprehensive Cancer Network publishes a staging monogram based on
these three features in their Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology. It is freely
accessible at http://www.nccn.org/. Patients with prostate cancer can be divided for
the purposes of treatment into three groups to guide treatment: localized prostate
cancer, locally advanced prostate cancer, or advanced prostate cancer.
Localized prostate cancer. By definition, cancer is confined to the
prostate. These patients are further subdivided into three risk
categories:
Low risk (T1-T2a, Gleason score ≤6, PSA <10): Expectant
management, radical prostatectomy (RP), external beam radiation
therapy (EBRT), or brachytherapy are all reasonable options for
treatment. If expectant management is chosen, PSA should be checked
at least every 6 months and DRE at least once a year. Curative therapy
is initiated at onset of disease progression. No clinical trials have
compared expectant management with immediate treatment. Choice of
therapy otherwise is based on patient preferences, as no clinical trials
have found any treatment modality to be superior.
Intermediate risk (T2b-T2c or GS 7 or PSA 10 to 20): Unless expected
survival is less than 10 years, expectant management is not acceptable
in this category. Otherwise, RP, EBRT, or brachytherapy are equivalent
454

management options.
High risk (T3a or GS 8 to 10 or PSA >20): These patients are treated
with either RP with pelvic lymph node dissection or EBRT combined with
at least 2 to 3 years of androgen deprivation therapy7 (ADT; see below).
Locally advanced prostate cancer (T3b-T4). Similar to patients with
high-risk localized disease, these patients are treated with either RP with
pelvic lymph node dissection or EBRT combined with 2 to 3 years of ADT.
It is also acceptable to treat this group with only ADT.
Metastatic prostate cancer. Surgery is not usually used for these
patients. Radiation or TURP can be used to palliate obstructive
symptoms. Otherwise, initial choice is ADT followed by chemotherapy in
castrate-resistant prostate cancer.
PSA only recurrence. These patients have a “biochemical recurrence”
that occurs after either radiation therapy or surgical resection, and no
source of recurrence other than elevated PSA can be found clinically or
through imaging. Treatment options include watchful waiting, radiation
therapy if they had previously had RP, or in selected patients salvage RP
if they were originally treated with radiation therapy.
Watchful waiting. This refers to complete deferment of therapy and
instead proceeding with palliative therapy. Prostate cancer is often
indolent in nature, which allows for watchful waiting as a reasonable
approach in selected patients. In general, this option is reserved for
patients whose life expectancy is <10 years and/or who have other
comorbidities limiting treatment options.
Androgen deprivation therapy. Prostate cancer is testosterone
dependent, and androgen deprivation often aids in controlling the
disease. ADT can be achieved either surgically through orchiectomy or
through hormonal suppression. Most men opt for hormonal therapy
instead of orchiectomy for psychological reasons. GnRH agonists are
first-line therapy for ADT and are as efficacious as bilateral orchiectomy.
Continuous treatment with GnRH agonists induces suppression of LH
synthesis and, therefore, testosterone production. Due to being agonists,
however, they cause a temporary flare in symptoms on initiation.
Therefore, GnRH agonists should be coupled with androgen receptor
antagonists when first initiated and continued for at least 7 days. There
are several GnRH agonists available, such as leuprolide and goserelin. If
patients progress through GnRH agonists, an androgen receptor
455

antagonist (e.g., flutamide, bicalutamide, nilutamide) can be added to
the regimen to achieve complete androgen blockade.
Another option for androgen deprivation is suppression of adrenal
androgen synthesis with high dose Ketoconazole. Corticosteroids are
also effective for suppressing the adrenal androgen synthesis by reducing
the production of pituitary ACTH.
Themain adverse effects of ADT include hot flashes, decreases in
libido, and loss of muscle mass. Osteoporosis also occurs at a higher rate
with long-term androgen deprivation. A baseline bone density screen is
therefore recommended prior to initiation of ADT. Patients should be
supplemented with calcium and vitamin D and bisphosphonate therapy
should also be offered to men who are found to be osteopenic or
osteoporotic.
Chemotherapy. Many men receiving ADT will eventually develop
increasing PSA values despite continued therapy. This progression of
disease is termed androgen-independent or castrate-resistant prostate
cancer. This resistance is due to adaptations at the cellular level that
allows the prostate cancer cell to grow despite a low-androgen
environment. A docetaxel-based regimen with prednisone is the current
standard-of-care therapy for patients with androgen-independent
prostate cancer, based on a demonstrated survival benefit of 2 to 3
months over mitoxantrone- and corticosteroid-based regimens in two
phase III trials (Southwest Oncology Group [SWOG] 99168 and TAX
3279).

RENAL CELL CARCINOMA

GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Primary cancers of the kidney can be divided into cancers of the renal
parenchyma and cancers of the renal pelvis that are generally transitional cell
tumors. This section focuses on cancers of the renal parenchyma, which are
generally adenocarcinomas (renal cell carcinoma [RCC]). Histologically RCC
comprises of four main subtypes. Clear cell is the most common and accounts for
~80% of the cases. Papillary or chromophilic RCC accounts for 10%, followed by
456

chromophobic RCC and collecting duct RCC.
Epidemiology

The American Cancer Society estimates 58,240 new cases of RCC and 13,040
cancer deaths in 2010. The overall incidence of RCC is rising for unclear reasons. It
is more common in men currently and slightly more common in blacks. The higher
incidence in males may change as smoking rates equalize between men and women.
Risk Factors

As with prostate cancer, age is the major risk factor for RCC. Accordingly,
disease predominantly presents in the sixth to eighth decades of life. Other risk
factors include cigarette smoking, obesity, hypertension, acquired cystic kidney
disease associated with dialysis, polycystic kidney disease, and occupational
exposure to heavy metal, asbestos, or petroleum products. Although not common,
there are several hereditary forms of renal cancer as well. A well-known example is
von Hipple–Lindau syndrome in which approximately two-thirds of patients develop
RCC.
DIAGNOSIS

Clinical Presentation

Unfortunately many patients are asymptomatic until advanced stages of
disease. Hematuria, abdominal pain, and a palpable flank or abdominal
mass are the classic triad of RCC diagnosis, but occur in combination only
10% of the time.10
Hematuria is the most common finding in RCC. Other symptoms include
fever, night sweats, malaise, and weight loss. One interesting potential
presenting symptom in men is a left-sided varicocele, secondary to
obstruction of the left testicular vein. Paraneoplastic syndromes are rare,
but include erythrocytosis and hypercalcemia from overproduction of
erythropoietin or parathyroid hormone-related protein, respectively.
Stauffer’s syndrome is another RCC paraneoplastic syndrome to keep in
mind, which consists of hepatic dysfunction in absence of liver
metastasis. This dysfunction may be due to production oftumorcytokines.
Diagnostic Testing

457

Imaging

The best initial imaging modality for a suspected RCC is an ultrasound. It is
inexpensive, is without radiation, and has a high sensitivity. It is also very useful for
distinguishing simple cysts from complex and malignant masses. If a suspicious mass
is found, ultrasound is typically followed by abdominal CT or MR to further
characterize lymph node and regional involvement. Role of PET in initial diagnosis
is unclear. Bone scan is indicated if patients have bone pain or unexplained elevated
alkaline phosphatase that could be due to Stauffer’s syndrome (see “Clinical
presentation”).
Diagnostic Procedures

Despite the sensitivity of imaging studies, biopsy of suspected metastatic lesions
or nephrectomy is needed to definitely establish RCC diagnosis, as well as to
delineate histologic subtype. Needle biopsy of the renal mass is not recommended
due to concern for seeding of the peritoneum, as well as sampling errors that result
in a negative biopsy.
TREATMENT
Table 26-1 lists a simplified staging of RCCs and their associated prognosis
based on contemporary studies.11 RCC is one of the most resistant tumors to therapy,
so surgery remains the gold standard. Treatment decision and prognosis is based
mostly on feasibility of surgical resection, and it is controversial whether
histological subtype affects management.
Resectable disease. Surgical resection can be curative and is the
treatment of choice in patients with stage I, II, and III disease. This
includes even patients with tumor thrombus involving the inferior vena
cava (IVC). Patients with a solitary metastasis should also be considered
for resection of primary renal mass and site of metastasis. Either radical
nephrectomy or partial nephrectomy are performed depending on the
size of mass and the patient’s reliance on the affected kidney for total
renal function.
Adjuvant therapy. There is no role for either chemotherapy or
radiation in the adjuvant setting currently, even though a portion of
these patients will have recurrence of disease.
458

After surgical resection, patients should be followed with repeat imaging
for evidence of recurrence. A repeat surgical resection can be considered
in suitable patients with recurrence.

Unresectable disease. Until 2005, only high dose interleukin-2 had
been approved by the FDA for treatment of advanced RCC. Although
toxic, this treatment was effective in a very small minority of patients.
Studies on patho-physiology of RCC have now revealed reliance of a
majority of the tumors on von Hipple–Lindau protein inactivation and
subsequent activation of hypoxia-induced vascular endothelial growth
factor (VEGF) overexpression for tumor angiogenesis. Two oral, smallmolecule kinase inhibitors, sunitinib and sorafenib, which inhibit VEGF,
are now approved on two phase III trials.12,13 Both drugs were found to
improve progression-free survival in patients with metastatic clear-cell
renal carcinoma. Other treatments based on the same rationale include
bevacizumab (anti-VEGF antibody)14 and temsirolimus (an inhibitor of
the mammalian target of rapamycin [mTOR])15 can be used. Both drugs
improved survival in patients with metastatic RCC and are currently
approved by the FDA for metastatic RCC.

TESTICULAR CANCER

459

GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Due to remarkable advances in treatment, testicular cancer is now one of more
curable solid organ cancers. This is especially important since it affects a much
younger population than most neoplasms. Five-year survival rate is now over 95%.
Classification

Testicular tumors are divided into seminoma and nonseminoma tumors.
Thenonseminoma tumors include embryonal carcinomas, teratomas,
choriocarcinomas, and mixed germ cell types. Leydig, granulosa, and Sertoli cell
tumors occur rarely. Nonseminomas are clinically more aggressive tumors. If
elements of both seminoma and nonseminoma are found on biopsy, management
follows that of nonseminoma, which is the more aggressive tumor type.
Epidemiology

As per the American Cancer Society, ~8500 new cases of testicular cancer were
diagnosed in 2010 with 350 dying of the disease. It remains the most common cancer
among men aged 15 to 35 years.
Risk Factors

Although it can affect men of any age, 9 out of 10 cases are in men between 20
and 54 years. White men have five times the risk of black men and three times the
risk of Asian Americans for unclear reasons. Other risk factors include
cryptorchidism, Klinefelter syndrome, and family history.
DIAGNOSIS

Clinical Presentation

A painless testicular mass is the classic presenting symptom. Testicular pain or
swelling can be present, but typically suggests epididymitis or orchitis, and an initial
course of antibiotics may be appropriate in this situation. Gynecomastia as the first
sign of testicular cancer is seen is ~10% of patients. It is due to tumor production of
human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG).
Physical Exam

460

A thorough physical exam is essential in patients with suspected testicular
cancer. Exam should focus on the testicles, lymphadenopathy (particularly
supraclavicular), scrotal edema, and evaluation for gynecomastia. Early metastases
to bone are rare but possible, and back pain can also result from bulky
retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.
Laboratories

Three serum markers have roles in testicular cancer: alpha fetoprotein (AFP),
β-hCG, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). These tumor markers are useful for
diagnosis, prognosis, and assessment of treatment. Although nondiagnostic by
themselves, it is important to know that pure seminomas do not produce AFP, and βhCG is elevated in only 15% to 20% of these cancers. By contrast, AFP and/or βhCG are elevated in more than 80% of non-seminomas.
Imaging

Testicular ultrasound is the initial test of choice in suspected testicular cancer.
Subsequent tests include a chest x-ray to rule out pulmonary metastasis and
abdominal and pelvic CT exam with oral and intravenous contrast to assess nodal
enlargement and staging. Chest CT should be included if any retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy is present or if there is high suspicion of pulmonary metastasis. Other
imaging options, such as bone scan or brain imaging, are guided by the patient’s
symptoms.
Diagnostic Procedures

Biopsy of a testicular mass should be avoided due to a concern for seeding and
dissemination of an otherwise curable cancer. A radical inguinal orchiectomy is
therefore recommended when workup, including imaging and labs, indicates
testicular cancer. Trans-scrotal orchiectomy has an increased risk of seeding. In
addition, retroperitoneal lymph node dissection is frequently used in patients with
low-stage nonseminomas for staging and curative purposes, and to remove remaining
viable tumor tissue in the lymph nodes.
TREATMENT
Treatment is based on histology type and stage. In general, stage I disease is
localized to the testis, stage II disease has spread to retroperitoneal lymph nodes,
and stage III disease is metastatic or has spread to non-regional lymph nodes.
461

Prognosis is generally very favorable with >90% of patients being cured with
therapy, including 70% to 80% of patients with advanced tumors. Sperm banking
should be discussed before initiation of any therapy.
Seminomas are very radiation and chemo sensitive. Stage I tumors are
treated with either adjuvant radiation therapy or single-agent
carboplatin for one to two cycles. Active surveillance is also an
acceptable option in motivated patients due to low risk of spread. Stage
II seminomas are treated with radiation therapy in non-bulky disease
and cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy, such as BEP (bleomycin,
etoposide, cisplatin) in bulky disease. Stage III seminomas are treated
similarly to bulky stage II with chemotherapy.
Nonseminomas are less radiosensitive, and patients often require
additional surgical therapies following orchiectomy. Most of these
patients will undergo retroperitoneal lymph node dissection for either
diagnostic or therapeutic purposes. The major morbidity of this surgery is
retrograde ejaculation with resulting infertility, which occurs is ~10% of
cases using an open nerve dissection technique. Adjuvant chemotherapy
is often recommended if the surgical resection reveals lymph node
involvement. Etoposide and cisplatin ± bleomycin is the
chemotherapeutic regimen of choice.
MONITORING/FOLLOW-UP
Patients with testicular cancer should have close follow-up after diagnosis and
treatment. This includes serial chest x-rays, CT scanning of the abdomen and pelvis,
and blood work for relevant tumor markers, in addition to a detailed clinical exam.
The National Comprehensive Cancer Network recommends tumor markers and chest
x-ray monthly for the first year and every 2 months for the second year, and specific
guidelines for follow-up is found on its Web site (www.nccn.org). It also
recommends abdominal and pelvic CT every 3 months in the first 2 years. PET scan
may have a role in surveillance, but this has yet to be fully determined. Screening for
late effects of platinum-based chemotherapy, most commonly dyslipidemias,
cardiovascular disease, and cerebrovascular diseases, should be included in followup as well.

BLADDER CANCER

462

GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Bladder cancer is primarily a malignancy of the epithelium. Urothelial
(transitional cell) carcinomas are the most common histological subtype and account
for >97% of bladder tumors. Other histologic subtypes include squamous cell
carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, and small-cell tumor.
Epidemiology

The American Cancer Society estimates that over 70,000 new cases of bladder
cancer were diagnosed in 2010 with 14,680 deaths. Similar to prostate cancer, the
median age at presentation is late in life (65 years). Medical comorbidities and life
expectancy play key roles in management decisions.
Risk Factors

Bladder cancer affects more men than women almost threefold. The most
important risk factor is cigarette smoking, with smokers twice as likely to get
bladder cancer as nonsmokers. Other known risk factors include occupational
exposure to aromatic amines in the dye industry, and work in certain other industries
such as rubber, leather, textile, paint, printing, and hairdressing industries. Although
uncommon in the United States, squamous cell carcinoma is a prevalent subtype in
areas endemic for Schistosoma haematobium.
DIAGNOSIS

Clinical Presentation

Symptoms are not always appreciated by patients, but hematuria is present is
~90% of individuals with bladder cancer. This may be intermittent or constant, frank
or microscopic, and is occasionally associated with symptoms of urinary frequency
or urgency. Otherwise unexplained hematuria in an individual older than 40 years
denotes bladder or renal cancer unless proven otherwise.
Diagnostic Testing
Laboratories

463

Urinalysis, including microscopic and gross examination, should be performed
to detect presence and degree of hematuria. Urine cytology has low sensitivity, but
it is usually sent as noninvasive adjunctive test that may yield the diagnosis.
Imaging

Imaging studies are performed to determine extent of disease involvement
usually after bladder cancer is already confirmed by cystoscopy. Abdominal and
pelvic CT, with and without IV contrast, is the test of choice. MRI is also
efficacious but is more expensive. Ultrasound has no role in evaluation of bladder
cancer. The role of PET is being studied.
Diagnostic Procedures

Cystoscopy is the diagnostic test of choice for evaluation and initial staging of
suspected bladder cancer. If a suspicious lesion is found, cystoscopy is usually
repeated underanesthesiatoobtainbiopsy.
TREATMENT
For purposes of treatment, bladder cancer is divided into three categories:
superficial, muscle invasive, or metastatic.
Superficial bladder cancer. Up to 75% of bladder cancers are
superficial at presentation. Most can be completely resected by
transurethral resection of the bladder tumor (TURBT). Most patients with
superficial bladder cancer will have recurrence within 5 years, even with
seemingly complete initial resection. Therefore, it is recommended that
patients undergo cystoscopy every 3 months after initial resection and,
depending on level of progression, be considered for intravesical therapy.
Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) is the most common and effective
intravesicular agent used. Other agents, including mitomycin, inter-feron,
and anthracyclins, are also used. None has been shown to be superior to
BCG.
Muscle invasive bladder cancer. The standard treatment is radical
cystectomy with pelvic node dissection. In males this also includes
removal of prostate and seminal vesicles, and in females the uterus,
ovaries, and fallopian tubes. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy has been found
to improve outcome in patients with muscle invasive bladder cancer.
MVAC (methotrexate, vinblastin, doxorubicin, cisplatin) is one of the
464

commonly used regimens, as a trial demonstrated a doubling of median
survival with this approach.16 A cisplatin-based adjuvant chemotherapy
regimen can be used in patients who did not receive neoadjuvant
therapy.
Metastatic bladder cancer. Cisplatin-based combination therapy is the
treatment of choice. MVAC is the most commonly used regimen.
Sometimes TURBT or radiation is used palliatively for symptoms of
obstruction. Unfortunately, median survival remains in the range of 12
months.

Tumors of the female reproductive tract are often diagnosed and managed by the
combined efforts of the primary care physician, gynecologist, gynecologic
oncologist, medical oncologist and radiation oncologist. This chapter describes the
approach to common gynecologic oncology evaluations and briefly discusses
selected gynecologic tumors.

VAGINAL BLEEDING

GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Vaginal bleeding can be caused by exogenous hormones, endocrine imbalances
including hyper- or hypothyroidism and diabetes mellitus; anatomic causes such as
fibroids, polyps, or cervical lesions; hematologic causes such as coagulopathy;
infectious causes such as cervicitis from Chlamydia trachomatis; and neoplasia.
Organic causes are either related to genital tract pathology or secondary to a
systemic disease. Cervical and endometrial cancers are the most common
malignancies that result in vaginal bleeding. Dysfunctional uterine bleeding (DUB)
is considered a diagnosis of exclusion and is the term used to describe abnormal
bleeding for which no specific structural cause can be identified.
DIAGNOSIS

Clinical Presentation

467

History

A thorough medical and gynecologic history, with careful attention to last
menstrual period and amount and duration of bleeding, should be obtained.
Physical Examination

A careful gynecologic exam, including a speculum exam and pelvic exam,
should be performed. A Papanicolaou (Pap) smear should be obtained, and any
suspicious cervical or vulvar lesions should be biopsied. A rectal exam with stool
guaiac should also be performed.
Diagnostic Testing
Laboratories

Appropriate laboratory studies include a complete blood count to detect anemia
or thrombocytopenia and a pregnancy test in reproductive-age women. In certain
individuals, thyroid-stimulating hormone and screening coagulation studies may
be appropriate to rule out thyroid dysfunction and a primary coagulation problem,
respectively. Von Willebrand disease is a common cause of heavy menses,
especially in adolescent women (see Chap. 7).
Diagnostic Procedures

Women with chronic anovulation, women with obesity, and those older than 35
years of age require further evaluation. A transvaginal ultrasound can be helpful in
evaluating for anatomic abnormalities, and assessment of endometrial stripe
thickness may prove useful in postmenopausal women. Endometrial sampling,
accomplished in the office using disposable plastic cannulae, should be performed
in these women, as they are at risk for polyps, hyperplasia, or carcinoma of the
endometrium.
TREATMENT

Medications

In most cases, abnormal bleeding can be managed medically. Acute, profound
vaginal bleeding should first be managed by assessing for a primary coagulation
disorder. If anovulatory bleeding is established as the working diagnosis, hormonal
468

therapy with oral or intravenous estrogen will usually control bleeding. If hormonal
management fails, a structural cause of bleeding is more likely. Hormonal
management, including oral contraceptives, can be used to significantly reduce blood
flow. When estrogen is contraindicated, progestins can be used, including cyclic
oral medroxyprogesterone acetate, depot forms of medroxyprogesterone acetate, and
the levonorgestrel-containing intrauterine device, which has been shown to decrease
menstrual blood loss by 80% to 90%.
Surgical Management

Options range from dilatation and curettage, endometrial ablation, hysteroscopy
with resection of uterine polyps or leiomyomas, myomectomy, uterine artery
embolization, magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasonography ablation, and,
most definitively, hysterectomy.

PELVIC MASSES
A variety of entities may result in the development of a pelvic mass. These may
be gynecologic in origin or, alternatively, may arise from the urinary or
gastrointestinal (GI) tracts. Gynecologic causes of a pelvic mass may be uterine,
adnexal, or, more specifically, ovarian. Age is an important determinant of the
likelihood of malignancy.
Ovarian masses
These can be functional or neoplastic; neoplastic masses can be either
benign or malignant.
Ovarian cysts. Functional ovarian cysts include follicular cysts, corpus
luteum cysts, and theca lutein cysts. Women with endometriosis can
develop ovarian endometriomas. Follicular cysts, defined by a diameter
>3 cm, are most common, and are most often <8 cm. They usually
resolve spontaneously and only require expectant management. Corpus
luteum cysts can rupture, leading to hemoperitoneum, which may
occasionally require surgical management. Theca lutein cysts are usually
bilateral and occur with pregnancy due to ovarian stimulation by human
chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). These cysts may be prominent in certain
conditions such as multiple and molar pregnancies. Combination
monophasic oral contraceptives can reduce the incidence of these
functional cysts.
Neoplastic masses. The most common benign ovarian neoplasm is the
469

mucinous cystadenoma. Eighty percent of cystic teratomas (dermoid
cysts) occur during the reproductive years. Epithelial tumors of the ovary
increase with age, and benign tumors of this type include serous and
mucinous cystadenomas, fibromas, and Brenner tumors. Malignant
ovarian neoplasms are discussed in the following section.
Other masses. Adnexal masses arising from the fallopian tube are
primarily related to inflammatory causes in the reproductive age group.
Examples of masses in this category include ectopic pregnancy, tuboovarian abscesses, and paraovarian or paratubal cysts.
Uterine masses
Uterine leiomyomas, commonly referred to as fibroids, are the most
common benign uterine tumors. Asymptomatic fibroids are present in up
to 50% of women older than age 35 years. Degenerative changes can
occur in these tumors. Smooth muscle tumors of the uterus rather
represent a continuum that ranges from benign lesions (leiomyoma or
fibroid) to malignant neoplasms (uterine leiomyosarcoma). Smooth
muscle tumors of uncertain malignant potential have 5 to 9 mitoses per
10 high-power fields (hpf) and do not demonstrate nuclear atypia or
giant cells. Leiomyosarcomas typically have ≥10 or more mitoses/hpf
and demonstrate nuclear atypia.
DIAGNOSIS

Clinical Presentation
History

History should include any history of urinary or GI symptoms, pelvic pain, or
vaginal bleeding.
Physical Exam

A complete pelvic exam, including a rectovaginal exam and Pap test, should be
performed. Evidence of ascites or a pleural effusion heightens the suspicion for a
malignant ovarian tumor.
Diagnostic Testing
Laboratory and Diagnostic Procedures

470

Workup usually includes cervical cytology, complete blood count, testing of
stool for occult blood, and a pregnancy test in reproductive-age women. CA-125
is a nonspecific tumor marker that may be obtained, but be aware that a number of
benign conditions, including leiomyomas, pelvic inflammatory disease, pregnancy,
and endometriosis, to name a few, can cause elevations of this marker. Endometrial
sampling with an endometrial biopsy or dilatation and curettage is necessary if both
a pelvic mass and abnormal bleeding are present.
Imaging

Pelvic ultrasonography, usually done transvaginally, will help to clarify the
origin and characteristics of gynecologic masses. Additional imaging by means of
computed tomography and/or magnetic resonance can be used in selected cases to
further delineate the anatomy or evaluate concurrently other anatomic sites. A barium
enema or endoscopic study of the lower GI tract may be indicated to exclude a GI
etiology.
TREATMENT

Once a nongynecologic problem is excluded, management depends
on the location and size of the mass as well as the age of the
patient. Premenopausal women with an adnexal mass <8 cm, with
predominantly cystic features, can be followed with close observation
and/or hormonal suppression. Women with a mass >8 cm, those with
complex, solid, or suspicious features on ultrasound, and those whose
masses persist or progress with close follow-up should be managed
surgically by a gynecologist or a gynecologic oncologist.
Recently, the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecologists, along
with the Society of Gynecologic Oncologists, released guidelines for
referral to a gynecologic oncologist for a pelvic mass. In these
guidelines, they state that premenopausal women with any of the
following should be referred: CA-125 >200 U/mL, ascites, evidence of
abdominal or distant metastasis (by imaging or exam), or family history
of breast or ovarian cancer in a first-degree relative. The criteria for
referral for postmenopausal women are slightly different: CA-125 >35
U/mL, ascites, evidence of abdominal or distant metastasis (by imaging
or exam), and family history of breast or ovarian cancer in a first-degree
relative. Surgery can be done laparoscopically or by laparotomy
471

depending on the size of the mass and concern for malignancy.
Most postmenopausal women with an adnexal mass should undergo
surgery to rule out an ovarian malignancy.

CERVICAL CANCER

GENERAL PRINCIPLES

Classification

The most common histologic types identified in cases of invasive cervical
cancer are squamous cell carcinoma (85%) and adenocarcinoma (5%). Less
common histologies include neuroendocrine carcinoma, melanoma, and sarcomas
(embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma in children and young adults).
Epidemiology

It was estimated that in 2010, there would be 12,200 new cases of invasive
cervical cancer in the United States, resulting in more than 4210 deaths. Worldwide,
~370,000 cases are identified each year. Despite the fact that screening programs
are becoming more established, cervical cancer is still the leading cause of death
from cancer among women in developing countries and second only to breast cancer
worldwide.
Risk Factors

Invasive cancer of the cervix is considered a preventable disease. There is a
long preinvasive state (cervical dysplasia), and cytologic screening programs as
well as effective treatments are readily available. Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia
is a precancerous lesion of the cervix.
Several risk factors for cervical cancer have been identified. These include
young age at first intercourse (<16 years), multiple sexual partners, cigarette
smoking, immunosuppression, African American or Hispanic ethnicity, high parity,
and lower socioeconomic status. Human papilloma virus (HPV) infection is
considered to play a causal role and can be detected in up to 99% of women with
cervical cancer.
472

Prevention

Cervical cancer can be prevented by detecting and treating cervical
dysplasia, thus avoiding progression from the preinvasive into the
invasive state. The Pap smear is the standard screening test for cervical
cancer.
Annual cervical cytology screening should begin ~3 years after the
initiation of sexual intercourse but probably not earlier than age 21
years. Women younger than 30 years should undergo annual cervical
cytology screening. Women aged 30 years and older who have had three
consecutive negative cervical cytology screening test results, with no
history of high-grade dysplasia, are not immunocompromised, and were
not exposed to diethylstilbestrol in utero may extend the interval
between cytology examinations to 2 to 3 years. The combination of
cytology and screening for high-risk subtypes of human papilloma virus
can be appropriate for women older than age 30 years. If such combined
screening results are negative, they should be screened no more often
than every 3 years.
Aquadrivalent vaccine against human papilloma virus types 6, 11, 16,
and 18 (Gardasil®), is now approved for girls aged 9 to 26 years. A
bivalent vaccine (types 16 and 18) has also been recently approved
(Cervarix®) for girls 10 to 25 years of age. Cytologic screening is still
recommended for those receiving the vaccine.
DIAGNOSIS

Clinical Presentation

The most common symptom in women with cancer of the cervix is vaginal
bleeding, which can often be postcoital. Asymptomatic women are usually
diagnosed on the basis of abnormal cytology. Advanced disease may present with
symptoms of mal-odorous discharge, weight loss, or obstructive uropathy. Physical
exam may reveal a palpable cervical mass, and palpation of the inguinal and
supraclavicular nodes may reveal lymphadenopathy.
Diagnostic Testing

473

If a gross lesion is present, cervical biopsy should be performed. Abnormal
cytologic screening should be evaluated as indicated with colposcopy and directed
biopsies, along with endocervical curettage. Cervical cancer is a clinically staged
disease, often via an exam under anesthesia to yield the most accurate assessment.
Cystoscopy, proctoscopy, chest radiographs, and intravenous pyelograms may be
used for staging purposes. CT, MRI, and PET scan are commonly used in the
evaluation of disease extension and for treatment planning. However, such imaging
modalities should not alter the clinical stage.
TREATMENT

The treatment of cervical cancer is determined by the clinical stage of disease,
with the underlying principle that therapy should ideally consist of either radiation
or surgery alone in order to prevent increased morbidity that results when the two
are combined. Stage by stage, these modalities are equivalent in terms of survival
outcomes.
Radiation Therapy

Radiation therapy can be classified as either primary or adjuvant therapy.
Primary therapy combines external radiotherapy to treat parametria and regional
lymph nodes and to lessen tumor volume with brachytherapy to target the central
tumor. Brachytherapy is delivered by intracavitary or interstitial implants. Intensitymodulated radiotherapy utilizes computer algorithms to distinguish between normal
and diseased tissues in order to optimize the delivery of radiation to the affected
area while minimizing radiation complications. Adjuvant radiotherapy is often
used postoperatively for patients with metastases to pelvic lymph nodes or channels,
invasion of paracervical tissue, deep cervical invasion, or positive surgical margins.
Adjuvant radiotherapy has been shown to decrease pelvic recurrence, but not
necessarily to improve 5-year survival rates. Complications of radiation therapy
include vasculitis and fibrosis of the bowel and bladder, as well as bowel and
bladder fistulas.
Chemotherapy

Randomized trials have shown that the addition of chemotherapy to radiation
therapy (known as chemoradiation) improves survival in patients with locally
advanced cervical cancer. Chemotherapy allows for systemic treatment as well as
sensitization of cancer cells to radiation therapy to improve local and regional
474

control. Cisplatin-based adjuvant chemotherapy is the treatment of choice for
patients with locally advanced cervical cancer. Single-agent platinum or multiagent
chemotherapy with platinum in combination with topotecan or paclitaxel are usually
prescribed in cases of advanced or recurrent cervical cancer. Multiagent
chemotherapy may offer improved response rates and modest survival benefits at the
expense of increased toxicity.1
Surgical Management

Surgical management is generally limited to patients with disease limited to
the cervix or with limited involvement of the upper vagina. Depending on the
clinical stage, fertility goals, and physical condition of the patient, surgical treatment
ranges from cone excision of the cervix, to simple hysterectomy, to radical
trachelectomy (where the cervix and parametria are removed with preservation of
the uterine corpus), to radical hysterectomy. The removal of the fallopian tubes and
ovaries is not part of the surgical therapy and should be considered on an individual
basis. In fact, surgery, when feasible, represents an attractive option for younger
women as it has the potential to preserve ovarian function and maximize quality of
life.
Treatment for Recurrent Disease

Pelvic recurrences in patients initially treated by surgery are usually treated with
radiation therapy. Cases of isolated central recurrences after radiation may be
salvaged by radical or ultraradical (exenterative) surgical procedures. Systemic
recurrences are most often treated with platinum-based chemotherapy.
MONITORING/FOLLOW-UP
Patients treated for cervical cancer require careful follow-up with clinical
exams, Pap smears, and various imaging modalities, as indicated. Positron emission
tomography at the completion of treatment appears to have important prognostic
potential. Similarly, this modality is also capable of identifying localized and
potentially salvageable recurrences.
OUTCOME/PROGNOSIS
The 5-year survival rate for early stage cervical cancer is ~85% with either
475

radiation therapy or radical hysterectomy. For patients with locoregional extension,
5-year survival falls to ≤40%.

OVARIAN CANCER

GENERAL PRINCIPLES

Classification

Malignant ovarian tumors can arise from the germinal epithelium, the germ cells,
or the sex-cord stroma. The World Health Organization has developed and
maintained a complex classification schema for ovarian tumors. The following
discussion concentrates in epithelial ovarian cancer. Most malignant epithelial
tumors are high-grade serous adenocarcinomas. Other histologies include the
mucinous, endometrioid, clear cell, and transitional cell types. Mixed varieties and
other rare variants also exist (squamous cell, undifferentiated, and neuroendocrine).
Epidemiology

In the United States, 1 in 70 women will develop ovarian cancer in their lifetime
(lifetime risk, ~1.4%). In 2010, it was estimated that 21,880 new cases of ovarian
cancer would be diagnosed in the United States, and 13,850 deaths were expected to
occur as a result of ovarian cancer. Epithelial ovarian cancer, which accounts for
~90% of all ovarian cancers, is the leading cause of death from gynecologic cancer
in the United States. This type of cancer is often diagnosed at an advanced stage, as
patients usually remain asymptomatic until metastasis occurs. The peak incidence of
invasive epithelial ovarian cancer is 56 to 60 years of age. Germ cell and sex-cord
stromal tumors are less common and typically occur in adolescents and younger
women.
Risk Factors

Ovarian cancer has been associated with low parity and infertility; risk factors
include early menarche and late menopause. Oral contraceptive use for ≥5 years has
been shown to reduce the likelihood of ovarian cancer by 50%. Mutations in
BRCA1 and BRCA2, along with Lynch or hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer
syndrome (HNPCC), are important genetic susceptibility factors for developing
476

ovarian cancer. In some patients, prophylactic oophorectomy may be a reasonable
approach, but this decision must be highly individualized.
Prevention

There is considerable public controversy regarding ovarian cancer screening,
but unfortunately, the value of tumor markers and ultrasonography to screen for
epithelial ovarian cancer has not been clearly established by prospective studies.
The tumor marker CA-125 has played an important role in the diagnosis,
management, and follow-up of patients with ovarian cancer. Particularly in
premenopausal women, CA-125 testing and transvaginal ultrasonography have
not been shown to be cost effective and should not be used routinely to screen
for ovarian cancer in the general population. Different screening strategies are an
active area of study in ovarian cancer research.
DIAGNOSIS

Clinical Presentation

Symptoms from ovarian cancer can be vague and nonspecific, and many
women remain asymptomatic for long periods of time. Abdominal
distention, nausea, vomiting, early satiety, and increased abdominal
girth may be reported.
In premenopausal women, irregular or heavy menses may be noted. The
Society of Gynecologic Oncologists has presented the Ovarian Cancer
Symptoms Consensus Statement in an attempt to educate the general
public about the signs and symptoms of ovarian cancer. The document
states that women who have certain symptoms (bloating, pelvic and
abdominal pain, difficulty eating, and early satiety as well as urinary
urgency or frequency) on a daily basis for more than a few weeks should
be specifically evaluated to rule out the possibility of ovarian cancer by
means of a skillful pelvic exam, ultra-sound examination, and CA-125
determination, as indicated. However, the value of screening for
symptoms to diagnose ovarian cancer remains highly controversial.
The most important sign on physical exam is the presence of a pelvic
mass, abdominal mass, or ascites. Pleural effusions are not uncommon.
Diagnostic Testing

477

The diagnosis of ovarian cancer is most often made by surgical exploration and
pathologic confirmation. Prior to exploratory laparotomy, a CA-125 level should be
drawn, and other primary cancers metastatic to the ovaries should be excluded,
specifically colon, gastric, or breast (via barium enema or colonoscopy, upper GI,
and mammo-gram, respectively). Preoperative evaluation may also include a CT of
the chest, abdomen, and pelvis to assess for extra-abdominal disease and
parenchymal liver lesions. In certain circumstances, a preoperative pathologic
diagnosis can be obtained by cytologic study of pleural/ascitic fluid or
percutaneous biopsy.
TREATMENT

Surgical Management

Treatment of ovarian cancer has historically begun with surgical staging and
cytoreduction. Thorough surgical staging is essential, as subsequent treatment will
be based directly on the surgical stage. Cytoreduction, or debulking, refers to
removing as much gross tumor as technically feasible. “Optimal cytoreduction”
(now defined as <0.5 cm largest residual tumor, or even better no gross visible
residual disease) confers a significant survival advantage.
Chemotherapy and Biologics

After cytoreductive surgery, adjuvant chemotherapy with a taxane- and platinumcontaining compound is used unless precluded by toxicity. Multiple studies have
evaluated the role of intraperitoneal chemotherapy in patients with ovarian cancer. A
randomized prospective Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG172) study has shown
that intraperitoneal cisplatin with intravenous paclitaxel improves disease-free and
overall survival compared to intravenous cisplatin and paclitaxel in patients with
optimally cytoreduced ovarian cancer. In general, the administration of
intraperitoneal chemotherapy involves significant toxicity. However, quality of life
1 year after treatment is comparable in patients treated intravenously versus
intraperitoneally. Multiple modifications to this intraperitoneal regimen are currently
being evaluated.2
A recent Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG218) study suggested that the
addition of bevacizumab to intravenous carboplatinum and paclitaxel followed by
bevacizumab maintenance might be associated with an improvement in progressionfree survival.3
478

Neoadjuvant and Maintenance Chemotherapy

A multinational Phase III study recently demonstrated non-inferiority of
neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by interval cytoreduction compared
to up-front surgery followed by intravenous chemotherapy. Neoadjuvant
chemotherapy must be considered in patients with obvious unresectable
disease and medical comorbidities precluding up-front surgical
cytoreduction.4
There is some evidence that single-agent taxane maintenance may delay
recurrences in patients who demonstrate complete response to up-front
treatment. However, a survival benefit has not yet been documented.
This modality should be reserved for patients participating in clinical
trials.
Treatment for Recurrent Disease

Treatment in the recurrent setting usually consists of chemotherapy. Selected
patients will undergo secondary cytoreductive surgery. In general, patients who
present with recurrence or progression more than 6 months after platinum-based
chemotherapy are “platinum sensitive” and therefore treated with combination
chemotherapy including platinum compounds. Those who have recurrences within 6
months of platinum-based therapy are considered platinum resistant. These patients
are treated with second-line chemotherapy agents such as pegylated liposomal
doxorubicin, topotecan, and gemcitabine, among others. Biologic and/or hormonal
agents are used in selected cases, alone or in combination with cytotoxic
chemotherapy.
MONITORING/FOLLOW-UP
After completion of adjuvant therapy, patients are typically followed with
clinical exams, Ca-125 levels, and imaging studies if clinically or biochemically
indicated. Recent randomized data have called into question the benefits derived
from routine surveillance using Ca-125. There appears to be no survival benefit
derived from biochemical screening followed by “earlier” therapeutic intervention
when compared to clinical follow-up.
OUTCOME/PROGNOSIS

479

Surgical staging is the most important prognostic variable for patients with
ovarian cancer. Five-year survival rates are estimated to be 75% to 95% for patients
with disease limited to the ovaries and 10% to 25% for those with extensive
peritoneal disease or extraperitoneal metastases at diagnosis. Other independent
prognostic variables include extent of residual disease after primary surgery,
histologic grade, volume of ascites, patient age, performance status, and platinumfree interval before recurrence. Interestingly, surgical management by a gynecologic
oncologist experienced in the management of this disease has consistently been
associated with better outcomes.

ENDOMETRIAL CANCER

GENERAL PRINCIPLES

Classification and Risk Factors

Patients with endometrial carcinomas can be generally classified into two
groups. The largest group is represented by estrogen-dependent or type I tumors.
Thesepatients tend to be younger at diagnosis. Unopposed estrogenic stimulation of
the endometrium in these cases is thought to cause endometrial hyperplasia and wellto moderately differentiated endometrioid carcinomas. Tumors of this type usually
carry an overall better prognosis. Risk factors for type I endometrial cancer include
iatrogenic unopposed stimulation of estrogenic receptors in the uterus (estrogens or
selective estrogen receptor modulators such as tamoxifen), chronic anovulation,
truncal obesity, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, nulliparity, and late menopause.
Type II patients are on average older at diagnosis and lack evidence of sustained
unopposed estrogenic endometrial exposure as their main risk factor. Tumors in this
group tend to be poorly differentiated and include more uncommon and aggressive
histologic subtypes such as clear cell, papillary serous carcinoma, and
carcinosarcoma (malignant mixed mullerian tumor).
Epidemiology

Endometrial cancer is the most common gynecologic malignancy diagnosed in
developed countries and accounts for more than 90% of malignancies affecting the
480

uterine corpus. It was estimated that in 2010, 43,470 new cases of uterine cancer
would be diagnosed and 7950 women would die of this disease in the United States.
The median age at diagnosis is 63 years.
Prevention

Since <50% of cases of endometrial cancer will have abnormalities on a
Pap smear, evaluation of the endometrial cavity to rule out malignancy
requires histologic evaluation. Several biopsy devices are currently
available and allow for endometrial sampling to be performed in the
office setting with a sensitivity >90%. However, screening for
endometrial cancer at the general population level is currently not
recommended.
Biopsy of the endometrium for screening purposes should be reserved for
women at high risk. This includes postmenopausal women who have
been treated with unopposed estrogen replacement therapy,
premenopausal women with prolonged untreated chronic anovulation,
and patients with estrogen-producing tumors. Tamoxifen use does not
represent an indication for endometrial surveillance with ultrasound or
biopsy in asymptomatic patients. Endometrial cancer is associated with
Lynch syndrome (HNPCC) as well as other familial cancer syndromes.
Women diagnosed with Lynch syndrome have a 40% lifetime risk of
developing endometrial cancer. Prophylactic hysterectomy with bilateral
salpingooophorectomy is an effective strategy for preventing endometrial
and ovarian cancerinthesewomen.
DIAGNOSIS

Clinical Presentation

More than 90% of cases will initially present with abnormal uterine
bleeding. Therefore, the presence of abnormal peri- or postmenopausal
bleeding should prompt immediate and thorough evaluation to rule out
the presence of a gynecologic malignancy. If cervical stenosis is present,
pyometra or hematometra may develop. Physical exam is usually
unremarkable. Slight uterine enlargement may occasionally be present.
A detailed history and physical examination should be performed.
481

Physical examination may offer evidence of chronic anovulation. Pelvic
and rectal exams will allow complete evaluation of the genital tract and
pelvic structures. This will assist in ruling out other diagnoses and
assessing the presence of extrauterine extension.
Diagnostic Testing

Office endometrial biopsy is very accurate (>90% sensitive) in detecting
endome-trial carcinoma. Patients with a nondiagnostic office biopsy or negative
biopsies in the context of high clinical suspicion should be further evaluated with
hysteroscopy and dilatation and curettage (D&C).
Initial evaluation usually includes investigation of blood counts, liver and renal
function, and radiologic imaging as needed to evaluate for suspected advanced
disease. This should include, at a minimum, a chest radiograph. When elevated, CA125 may suggest extrauterine disease and assist in evaluating response to treatment.
TREATMENT

Surgical Management

All patients who are medically fit should undergo surgical exploration with
complete staging. The surgical staging procedure includes pelvic washings for
cytologic evaluation, evaluation of peritoneal surfaces with directed biopsies as
indicated, extrafascial hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, and
pelvic and para-aortic lymph node dissection. Nodal dissection can be omitted in
cases of well-differentiated adenocarcinoma without myometrial invasion.
Minimally invasive procedures are becoming increasingly common for the initial
surgical staging and treatment of endometrial cancer.
Radiation Therapy

Adjuvant treatment with radiation and/or cytotoxic chemotherapy is
indicated for extrauterine disease or those with high-risk
clinicopathologic features (high grade, deep myometrial invasion, and/or
lymph-vascular space invasion).
The use of adjuvant radiotherapy in patients with early-stage
endometrial cancer has not been proven to improve survival, but may
play a role in preventing local recurrences that can have an important
482

impact on the quality of life for these patients. Radiation modalities
include the use of vaginal brachytherapy, external radiotherapy, and
intensity-modulated radiotherapy.
Chemotherapy and Biologics

Many cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents have been evaluated in
patients with endometrial cancer.5 The objective response rates to
several cytotoxic agents have varied widely. Platinum compounds
(cisplatin and carboplatin), taxanes (paclitaxel), and doxorubicin are
among the most active agents and are commonly used alone or in
combination for the treatment of advanced cases, with response rates
ranging from 20% to >40%. Other cytotoxic agents such as topotecan,
pegylated liposomal doxorubicin, and gemcitabine are also used in the
advanced and recurrent setting. More recently, there has been an
increasing interest in the use of biologic noncytotoxic agents such as
bevacizumab and tyrosine kinase inhibitors in this disease.
Hormonal manipulation with high-dose progestins approaches
response rates of 20% in the presence of estrogen and progesterone
receptors. This approach is often used for patients with advanced or
recurrent disease whose tumors tested positive for these receptors (most
commonly well- or moderately differentiated tumors) or in those with
contraindication for cytotoxic chemotherapy orradiation.
Treatment for Recurrent Disease

Vaginal recurrences can often be salvaged with radiation therapy. Single site
recurrences may be amenable of surgical resection and/or radiation. Distant failures
are typically treated with chemotherapy as previously discussed.
MONITORING/FOLLOW-UP
Patients are followed with periodic clinical exams, Pap smears, and imaging
studies if clinically indicated.
OUTCOME/PROGNOSIS

483

Early diagnosis in patients presenting with early symptoms accounts for high
cure rates in patients with endometrial cancer. In general, long-term survivorship
exceeds 75%. Patients with localized disease and well-differentiated tumors are
usually cured by hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy alone.
Several factors are associated with prognosis in patients with endometrial
cancer. These include histologic type, age at diagnosis, tumor grade and stage, depth
of myometrial invasion, and presence of lymph-vascular invasion. Overall, the
survival by Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage in endometrial
cancer approaches 85% for stage I, 75% for stage II, 45% for stage III, and 25% for
stage IV disease. However, these figures can vary considerably depending on tumor
grade, histologic type, and other clinicopathologic variables.

GESTATIONAL TROPHOBLASTIC DISEASE
This entity encompasses a spectrum of pathologic conditions derived from
placental tissues.

HYDATIDIFORM MOLE

GENERAL PRINCIPLES

Classification

Complete moles are tumors characterized by edematous chorionic villi
with variable degrees of trophoblastic proliferation. No fetal tissue is
identified. Most commonly, they have a 46,XX karyotype resulting from
duplication of the paternal haploid chromosomal complement.
Approximately 5% of cases have a Y chromosome (46,XY) derived from
double sperm fertilization. The uterine size is typically greater than
expected for gestational age. It is often possible to identify ovarian theca
lutein cysts as a result of ovarian stimulation by large amounts of hCG.
The risk of postmolar gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN) in cases
of complete moles is ~15% to 20%.
Partial or incomplete moles have variable and usually just focal
484

villous edema. Trophoblastic proliferation is mild and usually coexists
with a fetus or fetal tissues. Most commonly they have a triploid (69,XXX
or XXY) chromosomal complement derived from one maternal and two
paternal haploid sets of chromosomes. Most cases present as a missed
abortion, with uterine size less than that expected for gestational age.
The risk of postmolar GTN in cases of partial moles is generally <5%.
Epidemiology

In the United States, these conditions are rare and diagnosed is ~1 in 1500
pregnancies.
DIAGNOSIS

Clinical Presentation

Patients with complete moles usually present in early pregnancy with
an abnormally elevated hCG. Clinical presentation also includes firsttrimester bleeding (95%), excessive uterine enlargement (50%), and
medical complications (10% to 25%) such as hyperemesis gravidarum,
early-onset preeclampsia, and hyperthyroidism. These systemic
manifestations are mainly seen in cases with uterine enlargement >14to 16-week size.
Incomplete moles often present as missed or incomplete
abortions, and incidental diagnosis is made upon histologic evaluation
of products of conception. With the increased use of ultrasound and
measurement of hCG levels in early pregnancy, this condition is usually
diagnosed in the firsttrimester.
Diagnostic Testing

Once the diagnosis of molar pregnancy is suspected, pelvic ultrasound is the
imaging test of choice. The classic “snow storm pattern” sonographic
appearance is highly suggestive of molar pregnancy. Patients should be thoroughly
evaluated with complete blood counts, coagulation studies, renal and liver function
tests, blood type and antibody screen, determination of serum hCG level, and chest
radiograph.

485

TREATMENT
Treatment consists of evacuation of the uterine cavity in the operating room by
means of dilatation and suction curettage. High dose uterotonics are usually
administered after evacuation to prevent post-evacuation hemorrhage.
MONITORING/FOLLOW-UP

After evacuation, patients should be monitored with periodic
determinations of serum quantitative hCG levels. These should be
obtained weekly while hCG is elevated and then monthly for 6 months.
The objective of this surveillance program is to identify patients who will
develop postmolar GTNs. The hCG curve in these patients will usually
demonstrate rising or plateaued levels.
A normal pregnancy during the surveillance period would make
identification of GTN by means of hCG follow-up virtually impossible.
Therefore, effective contraception should be prescribed to these patients
during this surveillance period. Oral contraceptives represent a highly
desirable method for the motivated patient. This method does not
increase the incidence of post-molar GTN and is usually associated with
a cyclic and predictable uterine bleeding pattern.
OUTCOME/PROGNOSIS

In general, the prognosis associated with this disease is excellent.
However, ~20% of patients with complete moles and 5% of those with
incomplete moles will go on to develop the more complicated GTN.
After a mole, the vast majority of patients will have subsequent normal
pregnancies. However, there is a 10-fold increased risk of a second
hydatidiform mole (1% to 2%). Therefore, early obstetric ultrasound
should be recommended in all subsequent pregnancies.

GESTATIONAL TROPHOBLASTIC NEOPLASIA

486

GENERAL PRINCIPLES

Classification

The term gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN) or gestational trophoblastic
tumor (GTT) refers to various histologic entities that have the ability to invade
locally and/or metastasize. These conditions include persistent or invasive
hydatidiform moles, placental site trophoblastic tumors, and choriocarcinomas.6
GTN may develop after a normal pregnancy, after a molar pregnancy, or after an
abortion or, alternatively, may present primarily.
DIAGNOSIS

Clinical Presentation

Most cases will be diagnosed as a result of routine hCG level surveillance
after uterine evacuation following a molar pregnancy or a missed/incomplete
abortion (plateau or rise in hCG levels). Patients with locally invasive persistent or
recurrent disease often report vaginal bleeding. Diagnosis in these cases is usually
clinical. D&C is generally avoided to prevent potential uterine perforations. Most
patients with metastatic disease will have pulmonary involvement (80%). Other
relatively common metastatic sites include the vagina (30%), liver, brain, spleen,
and/or kidneys (≤10%). Biopsy of metastatic lesions should be avoided to avoid
risk of uncontrollable hemorrhage.
Diagnostic Testing

Evaluation should include complete blood counts, coagulation studies, renal and
liver function tests, pretreatment determination of serum hCG level, and
radiographic survey to assess for metastatic disease in the head, chest, abdomen, and
pelvis (usually CT scan and/or MRI).
TREATMENT
After radiographic studies and clinical determination of risk category (based on
487

age, type of antecedent pregnancy, time interval from index pregnancy, hCG levels,
largest tumor size, site and number of metastases, and history of previous failed
chemo-therapy), patients are assigned a stage and a risk score.
Surgical Management

Almost all patients with nonmetastatic GTN can be cured without hysterectomy.
These cases are usually treated with single-agent chemotherapy (methotrexate or,
less commonly, actinomycin D). In patients without a desire for future fertility,
pretreatment hysterectomy will reduce the amount of chemotherapy required to
induce remission.
Chemotherapy

Patients with non-metastatic or low-risk metastatic GTN can be
treated with single-agent chemotherapy (methotrexate or actinomycin
D). Approximately 40% of low-risk metastatic cases will fail single-agent
treatment and require additional multiagent treatment to achieve
remission.
Patients with high-risk metastatic disease or those who have failed
single-agent treatment will require multiagent chemotherapy. The
most effective and frequently used multiagent regimen involves weekly
administration of etoposide, methotrexate, and actinomycin D,
alternating with cyclophosphamide and vincristine (EMA/CO). Therapy
with methotrexate, actinomycin D, and chlorambucil or
cyclophosphamide (MAC) was the standard of care for many years before
widespread use of EMA/CO. Salvage regimens usually include
combinations with etoposide, cisplatin, and other agents. Occasionally,
patients with high-risk metastatic disease will require multimodal
treatment, incorporating surgical excision of metastatic lesions and
radiotherapy.
Surveillance of hCG is required during treatment. Chemotherapy is
usually continued until after normalization of hCG levels.
MONITORING/FOLLOW-UP
Once complete remission is achieved, contraception is recommended and
periodic physical exams and hCG levels should be followed strictly for 12 to 24
488

months. Imaging tests are used as necessary.
OUTCOME/PROGNOSIS
GTN is exquisitely sensitive to chemotherapy, and even patients with
widespread disease can be cured. Cure rates exceed 95% in patients with
nonmetastatic disease. Even in high-risk metastatic cases, multimodal treatment
results in cure rates up to 75%.

GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Brain tumors are neoplasms that originate in different cells of the brain (primary
brain tumors) or originate elsewhere in the body and metastasize to intracranial
compartment (secondary brain tumor). Metastatic tumors are the most common type
of brain tumors. 1
Classification

Primary brain tumors are classified according to cell type. The majority of
primary brain tumors in adults are gliomas (oligodendrogliomas and astrocytomas),
ependymomas, meningiomas, and primary CNS lymphomas. The most common
parenchymal metastases are from lung cancer, renal cell cancer, melanoma, breast
cancer, and lymphoma. Dural metastases are seen most commonly with breast or
prostate cancer.
Epidemiology

Brain tumors are rare malignancies—the 16th most common in frequency among
tumors in adult patients. Primary intracranial tumors have an incidence of 7.1 per
100,000, wit ~22,000 people diagnosed and 13,000 deaths in the United States each
year.2 Metastases to the brain are more common, with one estimate that >100,000
patients per year die from a systemic cancer that has metastasized to the brain.
Risk Factors

Ionizing radiation and genetic predisposition in identified syndromes are
currently the only known unequivocal risk factors for developing brain neoplasms.
490

Irradiation of the cranium, even at low doses, can increase the incidence of
meningiomas by a factor of 10 and the incidence of glial tumors by a factor of 3 to 7.
Other potential risks, such as use of cellular phones, exposure to high-tension power
wires, head trauma, and exposure to nitrosourea compounds have provided
conflicting and unconvincing data and, currently, are not considered to be risk
factors.
Management

Management of these tumors often involves a multidisciplinary approach
involving the neurosurgeon, neuro-oncologist, radiation oncologist, and neurologist,
among others. Rehabilitation efforts may be multidisciplinary and involve
rehabilitation specialists, physical and occupational therapists, and nurses.

ASTROCYTOMA

GENERAL PRINCIPLES
The epidemiology of astrocytic tumors depends on their histological grade. Lowgrade (grades I and II) astrocytomas are typically found in children and young adults.
The peak incidence in adults occurs in the third to fourth decade of life. High-grade
astrocytomas (grade III and IV) typically present in the fourth or fifth decade, and
glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) usually presents in the sixth or seventh decade.
High-grade glial tumors are most common, with an annual incidence of 3 or 4 per
100,000 populations. Of these, 80% are GBMs. GBMs may be either primary or
secondary (meaning the GBM has arisen from a tumor that was initially a low-grade
astrocytoma). These secondary GBMs tend to occur in younger adults, typically ≤45
years. The male-to-female ratio of malignant astrocytic tumors is 3:2.1
Classification/Grading

These tumors are graded by the World Health Organization’s four-tiered grading
system.3 The criteria used to grade these tumors include the following features:
nuclear atypia, mitotic activity, endothelial proliferation, and necrosis.
Grade I: absence of all features
Grade II: any one feature
Grade III: any two features (anaplastic astrocytoma)
491

Grade IV: any three features (GBM)
Pathophysiology

Astrocytomas are composed of cells with elongated or irregular, hyperchromatic
nuclei and eosinophilic, expressing glial fibrillary acidic protein in the cytoplasma.
GMBs may arise de novo from neural progenitor cells or transition from low-grade
astrocytomas. Molecular genetic abnormalities include inactivation of tumor
suppressor genes P53, PTEN, CDKNA, CDKN2B, and RB, overexpression of growth
factors PDGF and EGFR, and isocitrate dehydrogenase mutation.4
DIAGNOSIS

Clinical Presentation

Presentation of these tumors depends on their grade. Low-grade astrocytomas
present with seizure in ~90% of cases. Typically, the seizures are focal, but they
may become generalized and cause loss of consciousness. Headache is found in 40%
of patients. In general, the headache is worse in the morning and improves in a few
hours, usually without treatment. On occasion, headache can be unilateral and
throbbing, mimicking a migraine or even a cluster headache. Symptoms such as
hemiparesis and mental status changes are found in 15% and 10% of patients,
respectively. These symptoms reflect the location of the tumor. Malignant astrocytic
tumors, on the other hand, present with seizure 15% to 25% of the time and present
with headache 50% of the time. These tumors are much more likely to present with
focal neurologic deficits such as hemiparesis, seen in 30% to 50% of patients, and
mental status abnormalities, seen in 40% to 60% of patients.
Diagnostic Testing

The diagnosis of the tumors is usually suggested by MRI. Low-grade
astrocytoma is usually seen as a diffuse, nonenhancing mass that typically has a local
mass effect and evidence of cortical infiltration with abnormal signal, reaching the
surface of the brain. The radiologic borders of these tumors are usually distinct, with
no surrounding edema. High-grade astrocytomas have an irregular contrast
enhancement, which is often ringlike. These lesions are usually associated with
edema, and the mass effect can be severe enough to cause herniation. Pathologic
diagnosis of these tumors can be done by stereotactic biopsy or surgical excision of
492

the lesion. A stereotactic biopsy can (and often does) provide adequate tissue for
grading. However, in some instances it can underestimate the grade, especially in
large tumors.
TREATMENT

Therapy of low-grade tumors involves surgical debulking of the
tumor and perhaps excision of the entire tumor if the tumor does not
involve critical structures such as the language areas. With low-grade
lesions, the next step in treatment is typically radiation if the tumor is
not completely resected, has high MIB-1 index, or the patient is over 40
years of age. In younger patients with low-grade tumors that are
completely resected, observation is also appropriate. Radiation may be
done immediately after surgery or may be deferred until there is
radiographic evidence of tumor progression. Studies at this time have
not shown a difference in survival benefit between immediate and
delayed irradiation. Many physicians will wait to start radiation to
provide another treatment option at the time of progression.
Chemotherapy is also a treatment option in the recurrent setting.
Surveillance for recurrence with an MRI is performed every 3 to 6 months
for 5 years and then at least annually.
Therapy of anaplastic astrocytoma and GBM is identical. The initial
step is to surgically excise the tumor. Every effort should be made to
remove as much tumor as possible, as this is associated with longer
survival and improved neurologic function. Subtotal resection is done if
maximal safe resection is not feasible. During surgery, carmustine
(BCNU) wafers may be placed for local chemotherapy. This is followed by
60 Gy in 30 fractions of high-dose irradiation of the involved field with
concurrent daily oral temozolomide (75 mg/m 2).5 Bactrim should be
used for PCP prophylaxis during radiation. After completion of
radiation, the temozolomide is continued with monthly treatments of 5day duration for 6 cycles. MRI is performed 2 to 6 weeks after radiation
therapy, and then 2 to 4 months for 2 to 3 years. At the time of
recurrence, if the disease is localized, a second resection and BCNU
wafer insertion should be done if possible. Bevacizumab, a vascular
endothelial growth factor inhibitor, is FDA approved as a single agent for
recurrent or relapsed anaplastic astrocytoma and GBM.6 Nitrosourea,
493

cyclophosphamide, procarbazine, lomustine, and vincristine (PCV
regimen) or platinum-based regimens are also treatment options for
recurrence.7
Brainstem gliomas are inoperable. These tumors are treated with
irradiation. If there is increased intracranial pressure, a shunt may be
placed.
PROGNOSIS
Prognosis associated with astrocytomas is determined by their grade. The
median survival for adult low-grade astrocytomas is 5 years. Most of these patients
die from the progression of their disease to a higher grade. The median survival for
malignant astrocytomas is typicall ~3 years. The median survival for GBM is
typically 1 year.

OLIGODENDROGLIOMAS

GENERAL PRINCIPES

Epidemiology

Oligodendrogliomas are usually low-grade neoplasms and account for <5% of
intracranial tumors and ~20% of glial neoplasms. Mean age at presentation is 38 to
45 years, with a slight male predominance.
Pathophysiology

Oligodendrogliomas arise from oligodendroglial cells, which are responsible
for axonal myelination. More than one-third of these tumors have intermixed
astrocytic or ependymal elements and are therefore considered “mixed gliomas.”
They are classified as low-grade and anaplastic oligodendrogliomas (high-grade).
Classical oligodendrogliomas are highly associated with the 1p/19q codeletion.
DIAGNOSIS

494

Clinical Presentation

Patients may present with seizure, progressive hemiparesis, or cognitive
impairment, depending on tumor location. These tumors are known to have delicate
vasculature and hemorrhage easily, and the patient may present with an acute onset
of hemiparesis, headache, and/or lethargy.
Diagnostic Testing

Diagnostic evaluation usually begins with an MRI. The radiologic hallmarks
differentiating this tumor from an astrocytoma are lack of contrast enhancement and
calcification of the tumor. Biopsy, as in astrocytoma, is necessary for definitive
diagnosis, and excisional biopsy is preferred to stereotactic biopsy. Exam by light
microscopy shows oligodendroglioma cells that may have regular and rounded
nuclei, with some nuclei having a halolike appearance (sometimes termed fried egg
appearance). There are currently no immunohistochemical stains or markers that
definitively establish the diagnosis.
TREATMENT
As is seen with low-grade astrocytomas, therapy may not be necessary at initial
presentation if the patient is asymptomatic and seizures are adequately controlled.
Therapy of low-grade tumors usually begins with the excisional biopsy performed to
diagnose these tumors. After surgery, observation or focal irradiation and
chemotherapy are performed. Adjuvant chemotherapy includes temozolomide,
PCV regimen, nitrosourea, or platinum-based regimen. Studies have shown that 66%
of these tumors respond to therapy. 7 Chemotherapy is not curative, but it can induce
sustained remissions. Management should be individualized, and there is some
evidence that 1p and 19q loss in the tumor is associated with increased survival.
PROGNOSIS
The median survival for patients with low-grade oligodendroglioma is currently
10 years and that for anaplastic oligodendroglioma is 3 to 5 years. This long
survival is attributed to earlier diagnosis of these tumors with MRI and to their
chemosensitivity. Most oligodendrogliomas progress by becoming malignant.
495

EPENDYMOMAS

GENERAL PRINCIPLES

Definition

Histologically, ependymomas arise from the ependymal cells, which are
normally lining the ventricular chambers and the central canal of the spinal cord.
Most are histologically benign. Usually they are classified as either high or low
grade. These tumors may metastasize via cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pathways.
Spinal cord metastases that arise from a brain lesion are known as drop metastases.
The overall risk of seeding is ~10%, and the greatest risk occurs with high-grade
infratentorial lesions.
Epidemiology

Ependymomas have a bimodal incidence, with an early major peak at 5 years
and a late minor peak at the median age of 34 years. They account for 5% of
intracranial tumors in the adult population. There is a 3:2 male predominance.
Pathophysiology/Molecular Genetics

Ependymomas are generally slow-growing tumors. Genetic changes include
losses of chromosome areas 6q and 22q and the X chromosome, or gains of either 1q
or 9q, with monosomy 22 being the most frequent change in sporadic ependymomas.
DIAGNOSIS

Clinical Presentation

Clinical presentation depends on the location of the tumor. Most adult tumors
occur in supra- and infratentorial regions. They are also frequently seen in the spinal
canal, especially the lumbosacral region. The supra- and infratentorial lesions may
lead to symptoms of increased intracranial pressure or focal neurologic deficits and
seizures. Ataxia, vertigo, and neck stiffness are common presenting symptoms with
496

infratentorial lesions.
Diagnostic Testing

Extent of disease is assessed with an MRI of the brain and spinal cord. More
than 50% of these tumors will have calcification. Histological confirmation is
required for diagnosis, and open surgery is favored to stereotactic biopsy. CSF
cytology is important for staging.
TREATMENT

Therapy is surgical excision followed by observation if completely
resected or irradiation if not completely resected. Gross total
resection is the best determinant of outcome. Steroids may be given
both before and after surgery to help decrease edema and other
complications. Targeting only the local site with methods such as highfractionation radiotherapy and stereotactic radiosurgery has shown
promise in treating the tumor and limiting some of the complications
seen. There is no definitive role for chemotherapy at this time.7
Evidence of dissemination, as determined by MRI, positive CSF cytology,
or myelographic findings, warrants additional radiation of the spinal axis.
The dose and the extent of irradiation are also determined by the
histological grade, with anaplastic lesions generally receiving more
intensive regimens.
PROGNOSIS
Prognosis for these patients is excellent after treatment if the tumor is completely
resected. The 5-year disease-free survival is >80%. Ten-year survival rates range
from 40% to 60%. Age is the most important prognostic factor, with younger patients
having a worse outcome. Poor prognosis includes high histological grade,
incomplete surgical resection, and a poor performance status. Patients should be
followed by MRI, as the recurrence rate is significant.

MENINGIOMA

497

GENERAL PRNCIPLES
Meningiomas are extra-axial primary brain tumors. They are of leptomeningeal
origin, arising from arachnoid cap cells. They account for 33.8% of all primary
brain and CNS tumors.
Classification

Meningiomas typically are classified as one of four histological patterns:
meningothelial, transitional, fibrous, and angioblastic. The first three subtypes
account for the majority of the meningiomas and have benign behavior. The
angioblastic subtype is the least common but most aggressive form. Malignancy is
determined by the amount of brain invasion, increased and atypical mitotic figures,
increased cellularity, a papillary histological pattern, and distant metastases.
Malignant meningiomas account for between 1% and 10% of cases. Metastatic
disease is seen in <0.1% of cases. Radiation-induced meningiomas are more
commonly atypical or malignant.
Epidemiology

The annual incidence of meningiomas is ~7.8 per 100,000, although most are
asymptomatic and discovered incidentally at autopsy. The incidence of symptomatic
tumors is ~2 in 100,000, and they occur more frequently in women than men. They
are primarily adult tumors, with a peak occurrence at age 45 years. There is an
association with breast cancer, neurofibromatosis, and a history of cranial
irradiation.
Pathophysiology/Molecular Genetics

Deletion and inactivation of NF2 on chromosome 22 is a predominant feature in
sporadic meningiomas. Additional genes on chromosome 22 are likely involved as
well. 14q, 1p, 6q, and 18q are also lost in meningiomas. Meningiomas are reported
in families of several cancer predisposition syndromes involving the genes NF1,
PTCH, CREBBP, VHL, PTEN, and CDKNA.8
DIAGNOSIS

Clinical Presentation

498

Meningiomas can arise virtually anywhere along the leptomeninges. Ninety
percent are intracranial, and 90% of these are supratentorial. The three most
common sites are adjacent to the superior sagittal sinus, over the cerebral
convexities, and along the sphenoid ridge. These three sites account for 60% of
intracranial meningiomas. Clinical presentation of meningiomas varies greatly
depending on where they arise. Focal neurologic deficits are common, as are
symptoms of increased intracranial pressure. Seizures are particularly common,
occurring in >50% of patients. Many are found incidentally on CT or MRI.
Diagnostic Testing

Diagnosis of these tumors is suggested by MRI. They have a characteristic
appearance of marginal dural thickening that tapers peripherally (the “tail” sign), as
well as circumscribed, extra-axial, homogeneously enhancing, dural-based masses.
Peritumoral edema and mass effect are common. Twenty percent of the tumors have
calcification.
TREATMENT

Observation is preferred for tumor <3 cm and asymptomatic patients.
Surgical resection is recommended for tumor >3 cm or symptomatic patients.7
Total resection is curative for low-grade meningiomas. High-grade meningiomas
require radiation therapy followed by surgical resection. Stereotactic radiosurgery
is frequently used for tumors at the base of the skull, which are usually unresectable,
because they are intertwined with vital structures. At the time of recurrence, a
second resection should be performed, followed by external-beam irradiation.
PROGNOSIS
Meningiomas have an excellent prognosis. Disease-free survival at 10 years is
80% to 90% for all meningiomas. If the tumor is partially resected, the 10-year
progression-free survival is 50% to 70%. Nearly 65% of malignant meningiomas
will recur in 5 years, and nearly 80% will recur in 10 years. Patients who are
younger, do not have CNS invasion, and are able to have more extensive resection
do better overall. All patients should be followed closely for recurrence.

PRIMARY CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM LYMPHOMA
499

GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCL) is an uncommon variant of
extrandal non-Hodgkin lymphoma that can affect the brain, leptomeninges, eyes, or
spinal cord without evidence of systemic disease.
Classification

Ninety percent of non-HIV-associated PCLs are diffuse large B-cell type, with
the remaining 10% being poorly characterized low-grade lymphomas, Burkitt
lymphomas, or T-cell lymphomas.
Epidemiology

PCL accounts for approximately 3% of primary brain tumors. Patients with
congenital or acquired immunosuppression have a markedly increased risk of PCL.
The incidence of non-HIV-related PCL peaks in the sixth to seventh decades, with a
male-to-female ratio of 2:1. There are no environmental or behavioral risk factors
that are associated with the development of this disease. In immunocompromised
patients, the risk increases 100- to 1000-fold. This increase is believed to most
likely be secondary to infection with Epstein–Barr or other lymphatic viruses, which
have been speculated to be possible transforming events.9
DIAGNOSIS

Clinical Presentation

PCLs are solitary in ~50% of patients on presentation, and patients most
commonly present with behavioral or cognitive changes, seen in approximately twothirds of patients. Hemiparesis, aphasia, and visual field deficits are seen in ~50%
of patients and seizures in 15% to 20%. Approximately 15% will develop uveitis,
sometimes preceding cerebral symptoms by months.
Diagnostic Testing

These tumors are typically diagnosed with the use of MRI. They usually are
500

periventricular in location and have a homogeneous pattern of enhancement.
Approximately 25% to 50% of patients will also have cells identified in the CSF.
Stereotactic biopsy is necessary for tissue diagnosis. Further workup should also
include a slit-lamp eye exam, CSF cytology with cell count and protein assessment,
spinal MRI, chest x-ray, HIV test, blood cell count, and complete metabolic panel to
assess for other sites of disease.
TREATMENT

Unlike other intracranial tumors, there is no role for surgery other
than a stereotactic biopsy in primary CNS lymphoma treatment.
Corticosteroids can work rapidly to cause tumor regression and
decrease peritumoral edema, but should be held prior to diagnostic
biopsy in clinically stable patients. They have a direct lymphocytolytic
effect that may disrupt cellular morphology and lead to diagnostic
inaccuracy.
High-dose methotrexate as a single agent is now the standard care.
Whole-brain radiation therapy is used as salvage treatment of
recurrence. The radiation ports should include the orbits if retinal or
vitreous disease is present and also the spinal axis if CSF cytology
findings suggest meningeal disease.
Intrathecal chemotherapy is needed if CSF cytology or spinal MRI is
positive.
PROGNOSIS
Prognosis is dependent on treatment regimen. Radiation alone usually results in a
median survival of 12 to 18 months, but is not recommended for patients older than
60 years. When chemotherapy is used before radiation, the median survival
improves to 42 months, with 25% of patients alive at 5 years. Important indicators of
poor prognosis include age >60 years, ECOG performance status >1, elevated serum
LDH, elevated CSF protein, and involvement of deep regions of the brain.10

METASTATIC TUMORS OF THE
CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM

501

GENERAL PRINCIPLES

Metastatic lesions to the brain typically occur via hematogenous spread
and are 10 times as common as primary CNS tumors. There typically is a
predilection for the gray matter–white matter junction in which cerebral
blood flow is greatest. Spinal involvement may be secondary to spread
from the primary site to the vertebral body, with subsequent
compression of the spinal cord, retrograde spread via the vertebral
venous plexus, or direct invasion of the epidural space via the
intervertebral foramen. Alternatively, multifocal spread to the meninges
may occur. Twenty percent of cancer patients will develop brain
metastases, and 10% will develop spinal metastases. Refer to Chapter
35 for more information regarding spinal cord compression.
The lung is the most common origin of brain metastases. Other sources
include breast (especially ductal carcinoma), melanoma, renal cell
cancer, lymphoma, GI malignancies, germ cell tumors, and thyroid
cancer.
DIAGNOSIS

Clinical Presentation

Metastatic tumors present with the same clinical features common to any
intracranial mass but occur with a much more rapid rate of progression. Focal
deficits, seizures, and symptoms of increased intracranial pressure are the usual
presenting symptoms. The rapid progression is believed to be secondary to the
development of cerebral edema, which is usually associated with metastatic lesions.
Diagnostic Testing

Diagnosis of these lesions is suggested by their appearance on MRI or CT using
contrast. Ring-enhancing or diffusely enhancing lesions, typically surrounded by a
zone of edema disproportionate to the size of the lesion, are most commonly seen.
MRI is also useful and is more sensitive in identifying multiple lesions. Meningeal
involvement requires both brain and spinal imaging, where hydrocephalus or more
502

diffuse enhancement may be seen. CSF with positive cytology is diagnostic, and an
elevated CSF protein level is suggestive of meningeal disease. These cancers are
typically considered incurable with few exceptions.
TREATMENT
Therapy is palliative in nature. High-dose glucocorticosteroids will frequently
provide a rapid improvement in symptoms as the surrounding edema decreases.
Improvement occurs within 6 to 24 hours and is sustained with continuous therapy.
There is no role for prophylactic anticonvulsants in patients with brain metastases.
Whole-brain radiation therapy is the primary treatment mode for focal brain
metastases. For those patients who have a single lesion in the brain, surgical
excision or gamma-knife radiation may be used as a palliative measure. Surgical
excision is typically followed by whole-brain irradiation. For leptomeningeal
disease, radiation is limited to symptomatic sites and intrathecal chemotherapy is
initially administered weekly, and then monthly after four treatments. Methotrexate is
the most often used regimen, but cytarabine and thiotepa are other options. In
primary cancers that are chemotherapy responsive, systemic chemotherapy may
provide some improvement, although there is typically less of a response than seen
in the primary tumor.
PROGNOSIS
Survival in untreated brain metastases is typically 1 month. Survival improves to
a median of 3 to 6 months with the use of steroids and radiation. If the tumor is
amenable to surgical excision, the survival may improve to a median of 40 weeks.

GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Leukemia is the result of somatically acquired genetic mutations leading to the
dys-regulation and clonal expansion of myeloid and/or lymphoid progenitor cells.
The accumulation of neoplastic cells, both in the bone marrow and in the peripheral
tissues, manifests as cytopenias with associated complications, elevation of the total
WBC count, and dysfunction of the various involved organs. The diagnosis is
typically suspected based on an abnormal CBC and peripheral smear and then
confirmed on bone marrow biopsy. The prognosis and treatment depend on the age
of the patient, accurate determination of the type of the leukemia, and cytogenetics
and molecular markers.

ACUTE MYELOGENOUS LEUKEMIA

GENERAL PRINCIPLES

Definition

The acute leukemias are the result of abnormal clonal proliferation of mutated
progenitor cells. The mutations cause a block in the maturation process, leading to
an accumulation of immature cells. The expansion of the abnormal clone leads to
suppression of the other elements in the marrow, often producing clinical bone
marrow failure and making the patient gravely ill. The clinical course of untreated
505

acute leukemia is very brief, with patients succumbing in days to weeks from the
complications of marrow failure. Therapy involves intensive chemotherapy
regimens, prolonged hospitalizations, and, potentially, stem cell transplantation.
Classification

The French–American–British (FAB) group identifies nine subtypes of AML that
are based on morphology and staining (Table 29-1). They indicate the myeloid
lineage and the degree of differentiation. Cytogenetic evaluation is crucial, as it
helps to determine treatment and prognosis (Table 29-2). For example, the M3
subtype (acute promyelocytic leukemia; APL) is associated with the translocation
15;17, a distinct clinical phenotype (DIC), a good prognosis, and tailored therapy.
M7 is associated with a poor clinical outcome in the absence of transplantation. The
World Health Organization (WHO) has developed a classification system of AML
based not only on morphologic findings but also on genetic and clinical findings
(Table 29-3).1 In the WHO system, AML is defined by >20% myeloblasts in the
bone marrow aspirate. Patients with clonal cytogenetic abnormalities such as
t(8;21), inv(16), and t(15;17) have AML regardless of the blast percentage. Gene
mutations are increasingly being recognized as important diagnostic and prognostic
markers in myeloid neoplasms. These include, among others, NPM1, CEBPA, FLT3,
RUNX1, KIT, WT1, DNMT3A, and MLL in AML; and GATA1 in myeloid
proliferations associated with Down syndrome. Although over- and underexpression
of genes has proved to affect the prognosis in some myeloid neoplasms, at the
present time analysis of gene dosage by quantitative RT-PCR is not practical on a
daily basis, nor have gene expression arrays been introduced into routine use.2 There
are four main groups of AML recognized in this classification system:
1. AML with recurrent genetic abnormalities
2. AML with myelodysplasia-related features
3. Therapy-related AML and MDS
4. AML, not otherwise specified

506

507

AML with recurrent genetic abnormalities. This WHO category contains
AML variants that contain genetic abnormalities of prognostic significance:
AML with t(8;21)(q22;q22); RUNX1-RUNX1T1. This leukemia is
associated with a more favorable prognosis. The presence of c-KIT
508

mutations is an adverse prognostic features in patients with t(8;21).
AML with inv(16)(p13.1q22) or t(16;16)(p13.1;q22); CEFB-MYH11
(previously acute myelomonocytic leukemia, AMML, FAB M4Eo). This
leukemia occurs in younger patients and can present as an extramedullary
myeloid sarcoma. It is associated with a more favorable prognosis
although cases with an additional c-KIT mutation may do more poorly.
APL with t(15;17)(q22;q12); PML-RARA. It is notable that the
malignant cells in APL are promyelocytes, making this another AML
where the presence of 20% blasts is not required. Outcomes in this variant
of AML are generally favorable. It can present with disseminated
intravascular coagulation (DIC).
AML with t(9;11)(p22;q23); MLLT3-MLL. This type of leukemia is
usually monocytic and more common in children. It can present with DIC,
and high white cell counts with gingival or skin infiltration. It has an
intermediate prognosis.
AML with t(6;9)(p23;q34); DEK-NUP214. This is a rare type of
leukemia that is associated with basophilia, pancytopenia, and dysplasia.
It has a generally poor prognosis.
AML with inv(3)(q21q26.2) or t(3;3)(q21;q26.2); RPN1-EVI1. This
leukemia is also rare, accounting for only 1% or 2% of cases. Patients are
anemic but may have normal or elevated platelet counts. It is frequently
associated with dysplasia and is associated with aggressive disease and a
short survival time.
AML (megakaryoblastic) with t(1;22)(p13;q13); RBM15-MKL1. This
type of leukemia is also rare, but is typically a megakaryoblastic process
occurring in infants, although it is not seen in patients with Down
Syndrome. Sometimes it can present as a mass and mimic sarcoma.
Two provisional entities identified at the molecular level are
AML with mutated NPM1. The mutation is seen in about one-third of all
cases of AML making it overlap other types. In almost all cases, the
mutation is seen in AML with normal cytogenetics. The presence of the
NPM1 mutation confers a better prognosis, but only if it is seen alone.
When seen in conjunction with mutations in FLT3, it is associated with a
poor prognosis.
AML with mutated CEBPA. Mutation in CEBPA is seen in ~6% to 15%
of AML, commonly in cases with a normal karyotype. Cases with this
mutation are associated with a good prognosis.
Mutation in FLT3 occurs in 30% to 40% of patients with AML and normal
cytogenetics. Patients with this mutation often present with high WBC counts.
509

Two variants exist: FLT3 mutation with internal tandem duplication and a less
prevalent mutation affecting the tyrosine kinase domain of the enzyme. The
presence of a FLT3 mutation can overcome the favorable effects of NPM1 and
CEBPA mutations when they occur concurrently.
Epidemiology

AML is the most common acute leukemia in adults and accounts for ~80% of
cases in this group. In the United States, the incidence has been stable at 3 to 5 cases
per 100,000 population. In contrast, AML accounts for less than 10% of acute
leukemias in children less than 10 years of age. In adults, the median age at
diagnosis is ~65 years. The incidence increases with age with ~1.3 and 12.2 cases
per 100,000 population for those under or over 65 years, respectively. The male-tofemale ratio in ~5:3.
Risk Factors

Radiation, previous chemotherapy with alkylating agents or topoisomerase
inhibitors, myelodysplasia, myeloproliferative disorders, aplastic anemia, and
exposure to benzene are known risk factors for the development of AML. Higher risk
for AML is seen in people with Down syndrome (particularly AML-M7), Turner,
and Klinefelter syndromes. In most cases, no risk factors are clearly defined.
DIAGNOSIS

Clinical Presentation

Marked cytopenias from leukemic infiltration of the marrow result in diverse
presentations, including fatigue, pallor, and dyspnea on exertion from anemia;
hemorrhage from thrombocytopenia; and fevers and infection from neutropenia.
Extramedullary tissue invasion by leukemic cells (most commonly with AML-M5)
may result in hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, rashes (leukemia
cutis), gingival hypertrophy, CNS dysfunction and cranial neuropathies, intestinal
involvement, lytic bony lesions, or even establishment of infiltrative masses
(granulocytic sarcomas or chloromas). With myeloblast counts >50,000, leukostasis
may occur, resulting in dyspnea from pulmonary infiltrates or CNS dysfunction
(ranging from somnolence to cerebral ischemia). Spontaneous tumor lysis
syndrome may cause hyperuricemia, hyperphosphatemia, hypocalcemia, or
510

hyperkalemia and renal failure. Patients may also present with disseminated
intravascular coagulation (DIC; with excessive bleeding), which is more commonly
seen in the M3 and M5 subtypes.
Diagnostic Testing

Workup should include the following.
CBC. Pancytopenia or leukocytosis may be present
Coagulation profile. INR, prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, Ddimer, and fibrinogen to look for DIC.
Electrolytes. Tumor lysis may cause hyperkalemia, hypocalcemia,
hyperphosphatemia, or hyperuricemia.
Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)
Peripheral smear. Leukemic myeloblasts on Wright–Giemsa stain of the
peripheral blood and bone marrow aspirate demonstrate large nuclei with scant
cytoplasm and may contain Auer rods (eosinophilic needlelike inclusions).
Lumbar puncture. This should be done if neurologic symptoms are present.
Bone marrow aspirate and biopsy, evaluated for the following:
Morphology and histochemical staining
Flow cytometry, to distinguish AMLs from lymphoid and to determine the
subtype of AML
Cytogenetics, which is critical in the initial workup for AML since it
provides a wealth of prognostic information and helps to guide therapy
Molecular studies, abnormalities in certain genes, such as mutations in
FLT3, nucleophosmin (NPM1), KIT, or CEBPA, to confer prognostic
significance in adult patients with AML
TREATMENT
Treatment is divided into two phases: induction and consolidation. The goal is
to achieve remission, defined as <5% blasts in the bone marrow and recovery of
peripheral blood counts.
Induction chemotherapy consists of 7 days of cytarabine (Ara-C) and 3 days of
an anthracycline (daunorubicin or idarubicin; “7 + 3” regimen). Complete
remission can be obtained in ~70% to 80% of patients <60 years and in ~50%
of older patients. In patients with AML who are older than 60 years of age,
escalation of the dose of daunorubicin to twice the conventional dose effects a
511

more rapid response and a higher response rate than does the conventional
dose, without additional toxic effects.3 Patients are generally admitted to the
hospital during induction for nearly a month, require frequent blood and platelet
transfusions, and often have febrile neutropenia.
Consolidation therapy is essential to prevent relapse and is guided by
cytogenetics, age, and patient comorbidities. Therapeutic options include
allogeneic bone marrow transplantation or further chemotherapy with high-dose
cytarabine (HiDAC) or other regimens. HiDAC is efficacious in younger
patients and those with core binding factor leukemia. It is considered too toxic
for general use in patients over 60 years with AML due to a higher incidence of
cerebellar ataxia (>30% in patients ≥60 years), which is irreversible in some
patients. Autologous transplants offer little to no benefit over chemotherapy.
For promyelocytic (M3) leukemia, all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) is given
with induction chemotherapy. ATRA ameliorates the coagulopathy associated
with M3 but is also associated with the potentially dangerous APL
differentiation syndrome. Maintenance therapy with lower-dose ATRA is
commonly used. Recent data show that consolidation with arsenic trioxide
(ATO) decreases risk of relapse and improves overall survival. Relapse
occurs in 5% to 10% of patients with APL and in ~20% to 30% of those with
high-risk APL as defined as those who present with a white blood cell count
above 10,000 and a platelet count less than 40,000. ATO is the treatment of
choice for most patients with relapsed APL. Second complete remission can
be obtained in 85% to 88% of patients. It is unclear whether adding ATRA to
ATO is better than ATO alone. ATO is able to penetrate the blood-brain
barrier and so can be used in patients with CNS involvement. If a second
remission is obtained and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RTPCR) testing is negative for the PML/RAR-alpha transcript, consolidation with
either autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), allogeneic HCT, or
further ATO is recommended. If PCR negativity is not obtained, allogeneic
HCT becomes the favored treatment.
In the case of relapse, patients should be salvaged with intensive chemotherapy
and then considered for allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. Patients who
are not transplant candidates, due to age or comorbidities, should be
considered for treatment on clinical trials.
COMPLICATIONS
Leukostasis may cause symptoms that require emergent cytoreduction with
512

hydroxyurea and/or leukapheresis. Tumor lysis syndrome, fever, and neutropenia are
all concerns as well (see Chap. 35). Cytopenias should be supported with
transfusions, and coagulopathy should be corrected. Prospective trials have
identified 10,000/μL as a relatively safe transfusion threshold for platelets during
inpatient induction chemotherapy. If the patient has received a bone marrow
transplant, he or she should be followed closely for symptoms of opportunistic
infections and graft-versus-host disease (see Chap. 31).
PROGNOSIS
Leukemia can typically be divided into good, poor, and intermediate prognostic
groups.
Good-prognosis leukemias are those with favorable cytogenetics: translocation
(15;17) (associated with M3 AML), translocation (8;21) (associated with M2
AML), and inversion 16 (associated with M4 AML with eosinophilia). These
patients are typically offered induction therapy followed by chemotherapybased consolidation, as they have a relatively high rate of cure by this strategy
(~60% to 70%).
Poor prognostic indicators include age >60 years; AML secondary to
myelodysplastic syndrome or antecedent hematologic disorder; deletion of 5q,
7q, or trisomy 8; and lack of the favorable cytogenetics noted earlier. Patients
with poor-prognosis leukemia have a high rate of relapse and should be
considered for allogeneic bone marrow transplant in first remission.
Patients with normal cytogenetics fall into an intermediate risk group, and
management should be individualized after remission. New molecular
prognostic markers such as mutations in the FLT-3, NPM, DNMT3A, and MLL
genes may help guide therapy in this group. Clinical trials are always ongoing,
a nd whenever appropriate, patients in all groups should be considered for
participation. Since 1970, the 5-year survival rate has increased from 15% to
40% with advances in antileukemic and supportive therapies (i.e., antibiotics,
antifungals, improvement in transfusion medicine).

ACUTE LYMPHOBLASTIC LEUKEMIA

GENERAL PRINCIPLES
513

Definition

Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) results from the abnormal proliferation of a
lymphoid hematopoietic progenitor cell. It accounts for 80% of childhood leukemias
and 20% of adult acute leukemias. The median age at diagnosis is 13 years old, with
39% of cases diagnosed in patients older than 20 years. People with Down
syndrome are at a higher risk for developing ALL. This section deals only with adult
ALL, which has a worse prognosis than childhood ALL.
Classification

Classification is based on morphologic (FAB system) and immunophenotypic
information (Table 29-3). Many different translocations have been reported in B
ALL, three of which predict response to intensive chemotherapy.
The Philadelphia chromosome: t(9;22)(a34;q11); BCR/ABL is the most
frequent rearrangement in adult ALL and is associated with a poor prognosis. It
is present in 25% of adult and 3% of childhood cases. The incidence of t(9;22)
increases with age and is present in 40% to 50% of patients older than 60
years.
t(v;11q23); MLL rearranged: associated with a poor prognosis, seen in
infants <1 year and adults.
t(12;21)(p12;q22) TEL/AML1: associated with a good prognosis and hyperdiploidy, this is the most common rearrangement seen in children.
The t(9;22) and t(v;11q23) are often associated with a pro-B immunophenotype
and a poor prognosis, while the t(12;21) is associated with common pre-B ALL.
DIAGNOSIS

Clinical Presentation

The clinical phenotype of ALL is very similar to that of AML. Patients present
with malaise, fatigue, dyspnea, and bone pain. Patients also typically have signs of
marrow failure such as bleeding, bruising, fever, and infection. More commonly than
in AML, in up to 10% of patients, the CNS may be involved at presentation,
manifesting as headache and/or cranial nerve palsies. Leukostasis may also be
514

present. Hepatosplenomegaly and lymphadenopathy can be seen. ALL can be
associated with an anterior mediastinal mass (in T-cell subtypes) or large abdominal
lymph nodes (in B-cell subtypes).
Diagnostic Testing

Basic workup is similar to that for AML. A peripheral smear will usually
demonstrate the presence of circulating blasts. Bone marrow will be hypercellular,
with >30% blasts. Cytoplasmic granules and Auer rods should be absent. However,
it can be extremely difficult to diagnose ALL on clinical and morphologic grounds
alone. Immunophenotyping is often necessary to distinguish ALL from AML. Thirty
percent of adult ALL patients exhibit the Philadelphia chromosome t(9;22), as seen
in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML).
TREATMENT
Therapy for ALL consists of multiple phases.
Induction chemotherapy typically consists of vincristine, a steroid, and an
anthracycline. Most protocols include l-asparaginase as well. One regimen is
hyper-CVAD (cyclophosphamide, vincristine, dexamethasone, and doxorubicin
alternating with high-dose methotrexate and cytarabine with incorporated
intrathecal therapy).4 These multiagent protocols carry the burden of profound
myelosuppression, and patients must be followed for infectious and cytopenic
complications. Induction mortality rates range from 3% to 20% but these
regimens boast complete remission rates of 65% to 90%. The BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib has been incorporated into induction regimens in
patients who harbor the Philadelphia chromosome (t(9;22)).
CNS prophylaxis is an important component of therapy for ALL, as it has a
high incidence of recurrence in the CNS. Regimens typically consist of
intrathecal methotrexate and cytarabine.
Maintenance therapy is typically continued for 2 years, often with
mercaptopurine, prednisone, vincristine, and methotrexate (the so-called POMP
regimen).
Relapse, unfortunately, is common in adult ALL. Salvage chemotherapy
regimens are able to induce a second complete remission in ~30% to 70% of
persons, and when consolidated with allogeneic stem cell transplantation ~40%
of patients will be alive at 4 years.
515

PROGNOSIS
Although 60% to 90% of patients can expect to undergo a complete remission
with induction chemotherapy, the majority of patients will relapse. Patients who are
younger and have good prognostic indicators have a cure rate of 50% to 70%. Those
who are older and have poor prognostic indicators have a cure rate of only 10% to
30%. Adverse risk factors are summarized in Table 29-4.

CHRONIC MYELOGENOUS LEUKEMIA

GENERAL PRINCIPLES

Epidemiology

CML accounts for 14% of all leukemias and 20% of adult leukemias, with an
annual incidence of 1.6 cases per 100,000 adults. Since the advent of imatinib, the
annual mortality has decreased to 1% to 2%. The median age at presentation is 65,
and incidence increases with age.
Etiology

516

The etiology is unclear; no correlation with monozygotic twins, geography,
ethnicity, or economic status has been observed. However, a significantly higher
incidence of CML has been noted in survivors of the atomic disasters at Nagasaki
and Hiroshima, in radiologists, and in patients treated with radiation to the spine for
ankylosing spondylitis.
Pathophysiology

CML is associated with the fusion of two genes: BCR (on chromosome 22) and
ABL1 (on chromosome 9) resulting in the BCR-ABL1 fusion gene. This
abnormal fusion typically results from a reciprocal translocation between
chromosomes 9 and 22, t(9;22)(q34;q11), that gives rise to an abnormal
chromosome 22 called the Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome. It is this derivative
chromosome 22 which harbors the BCR-ABL1 fusion gene. The BCR-ABL1
fusion gene results in the formation of a unique gene product, the BCR-ABL1
fusion protein. This protein product includes an enzymatic domain from the
normal ABL1 with tyrosine kinase catalytic activity, but relative to ABL1,
whose kinase activity is tightly regulated, the kinase activity of BCR-ABL1 is
elevated and constitutive due to fusion with a portion of BCR. It is this
deregulated tyrosine kinase that is implicated in the pathogenesis of CML.5
Blast-phase CML is characterized by cytogenetic evolution in ~70% of
patients. The most common chromosomal abnormalities are trisomy 8, in 30%
to 40% of patients, additional Ph chromosome, in 20% to 30%, and
isochromosome 17, in 15% to 20%. Corresponding mutations in p53 are also
seen in 20% to 30% of patients, amplification of c-myc in 20%, and, less
commonly, mutations and deletions of ras, Rb, or p16. As with de novo AML,
complex cytogenetics are associated with decreased response rates and
survival.
The natural history of CML is a triphasic process.
Most patients present in chronic phase, characterized by an asymptomatic
accumulation of differentiated myeloid cells in the bone marrow, spleen,
and peripheral blood. CML usually progresses through a transient
accelerated phase, lasting 4 to 6 months, and then inevitably to blast
phase, an incurable acute leukemia that is fatal within 3 to 6 months. In the
2 years after initial diagnosis of CML, 5% to 15% of untreated patients
will enter blast crisis. In subsequent years, the annual rate of progression
increases to 20% to 25%, with progression commonly occurring between
3 and 6 years after diagnosis.
The definition of accelerated-phase CML relies on several clinical and
517

laboratory features and is characterized by increasing arrest of maturation.
Current WHO criteria include at least one of the following: 10% to 19%
blasts in peripheral blood or bone marrow, ≥20% peripheral basophils,
thrombocytopenia <100,000/μL and lack of response to therapy,
increasing spleen size and increasing WBC unresponsive to therapy, and
cytogenetic evidence of clonal evolution. Once either accelerated phase or
blast crisis occurs, the success of any therapy declines dramatically.
DIAGNOSIS

Clinical Presentation

In most patients, CML is diagnosed incidentally. Symptoms can result from
concurrent anemia and splenomegaly (fatigue, early satiety, and sensation of
abdominal fullness) but may also include weight loss, bleeding, and bruising in
advanced disease.
Diagnostic Testing

Blood smear shows leukocytosis with a myeloid shift. In contrast to cases of
acute leukemia, in which an arrest in maturation is the rule, granulocytes at all
stages of maturation are observed. Anemia and thrombocytosis are common,
while basophilia (>7%) occurs in only 10% to 15% of patients. Leukocyte
alkaline phosphatase (LAP) activity is usually reduced but can be increased
with infections, stress, on achievement of remission, or on progression to blast
phase.
The diagnosis is confirmed by the detection of the Ph chromosome t(9;22)
(q34.1;q11.21). In 5% of patients a BCR-ABL fusion can be detected without
classic Ph chromosomal cytogenetics, and rarely translocations can involve
three or more chromosomes. The bone marrow is typically hypercellular and
devoid of fat. All stages of myeloid differentiation are present and
megakaryocytes may be increased, suggesting that chronic-phase CML is a
disease of discordant maturation, where a delay in myeloid maturation results
in increased myeloid cell mass.
TREATMENT

518

Chronic-Phase Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia

The two main treatment options for patients with newly diagnosed CML in
chronic phase are
BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), such as imatinib, dasatinib, and
nilotinib
Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT)
As the only treatment option with proven ability to cure CML, allogeneic HCT
was the primary therapy for younger patients in chronic phase before the
development of TKIs. However, now that TKIs have demonstrated long-term
disease control and good tolerability, most patients are not referred for
allogeneic transplantation as initial therapy. Instead, they are treated with TKIs
and careful follow-up, with allogeneic HCT reserved for patients with
refractory or progressive disease.
Imatinib mesylate (Gleevec) is a targeted TKI, which antagonizes the activity
of the ABL tyrosine kinase, as well as c-Kit and platelet-derived growth
factors alpha and beta. At nanomolar concentrations, imatinib binds to the
inactive conformation of the BCR-ABL ATP-binding pocket, resulting in
competitive inhibition of BCR-ABL and growth inhibition of BCR-ABLpositive bone marrow progenitor cells. In a large Phase III trial, patients
randomized to imatinib 400 mg daily had complete hematologic and cytogenetic
remission rates of 95% and 74%, respectively, which was clearly superior to
the standard arm of interferon-alfa + low dose cytarabine.6 Although a few case
reports are emerging of patients with continued complete cytogenetic response
after imatinib withdrawal, relapse is common, and lifelong maintenance therapy
is recommended at this time. Side effects of imatinib mesylate are generally
mild but include hematologic suppression (neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and
anemia), constitutional symptoms (diarrhea, edema, and rash), and rare organ
damage (elevated transaminases, hypophosphatemia, and potentially
cardiotoxicity). These can usually be managed with growth factors or dose
reduction but occasionally require discontinuation, either briefly or
permanently.
Since the development of imatinib, more potent, second-generation TKIs have
been developed. The three second-generation TKIs that have been studied most
extensively are dasatinib, nilotinib, and bosutinib. Nilotinib and dasatinib are
approved for the treatment of newly diagnosed CML. Phase III trials comparing
dasatinib or nilotinib to imatinib as initial therapy for CML in chronic phase
have demonstrated faster and deeper responses with these second-generation
519

TKIs. At 12 months, the rates of major molecular response for nilotinib and
dasatinib (~45%) were nearly twice that for imatinib. The rates of complete
cytogenetic response by 12 months were significantly higher for nilotinib and
dasatinib (~80%) than for imatinib (~65%).7,8 Further follow-up is needed to
confirm whether the substantial short term improvements will result in longer
term benefits, such as improved survival.
The side effect profiles of dasatinib and nilotinib are different from each
other and compare favorably to that of imatinib. A choice among agents
should take into consideration these drug side effect profiles and the
patient’s comorbidities. For example, dasatinib might be preferred in a
patient with a history of pancreatitis, elevated bilirubin, or hyperglycemia,
while nilotinib might be chosen for a patient with a history of pleural or
pericardial disease or effusions. Patients who are currently being treated
successfully with imatinib who have achieved complete cytogenetic
response with good tolerance of the side effects, should be continued on
imatinib and should not be switched to dasatinib or nilotinib.
Increased risk of progression to accelerated and blast phase has been
demonstrated if patients do not achieve specific clinical goals. These currently
include the following, from the time a patient starts TKI therapy:
3 months: complete hematologic response with normal peripheral counts
and a >1 log reduction in BCR-ABL transcripts by quantitative PCR
(qPCR)
6 months: cytogenetic response with <35% Ph chromosome-positive
bone marrow cells
12 months: complete cytogenetic response with undetectable Ph
chromosome
18 months: major molecular remission with a 3 log reduction by qPCR of
peripheral BCR-ABL
Failure to reach any of these goals warrants close follow-up, ABL
tyro-sine kinase domain mutation analysis, dose escalation, and/or change
to second-line TKI and consideration of hematopoietic stem cell
transplant.
Resistance to imatinib has been noted in 2% to 4% of patients annually for the
first 3 years of imatinib therapy and may decrease thereafter. Point mutations in
the SH1 kinase domain are commonly associated with resistance. These
mutations either decrease the affinity for imatinib binding in the ATP-binding
pocket or shift the kinetics of BCR-ABL to prefer the active conformation, to
which imatinib will not bind. Imatinib resistance can be overcome with either
increasing doses or a second-line TKI, although the point mutation T315I
520

confers a high degree of resistance to all available TKIs.
While effective, chemotherapy is second-line to the well-tolerated TKIs.
Hydro-xyurea, busulfan, and interferon-alpha have been used with some
success.
Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant from either related or
unrelated donors remains the only known curative therapy for CML.
Transplantation from a matched sibling donor during chronic phase is
associated with a 10-year survival of 50% to 70%, but this decreases to 20%
to 40% and <20% in accelerated and blast phase, respectively.
Accelerated and Blast-Phase Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia

As advances are made in the treatment of CML, fewer patients (~7% at 5 years)
are progressing to accelerated phase or blast crisis. In addition, 10% to 15 %
of patients will initially present in accelerated phase or blast crisis. In general,
an attempt is made to return the patient to a chronic phase with plans to proceed
to allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation after an initial response.
Imatinib has been shown to improve survival in accelerated phase at higher
doses (600 to 800 mg), but responses are often short lived.
Treatment of BP-CML remains a challenge, with survival of only 2 to 4 months
in nonresponders. Treatment is dictated by hematologic features. Myeloid
features are seen in 50% of patients, lymphoid in 25%, and undifferentiated in
25%. Typical AML induction chemotherapy is used for BP-CML with myeloid
features and ALL induction chemotherapy for lymphoid features. Each has a
response rate of only 30%. Transplant during BP-CML remains the only
curative options, but it is associated with a ~80% risk of relapse and a 5-year
survival of only ~5%.
MONITORING/FOLLOW-UP
Follow-up during initial treatment requires CBC monthly, peripheral BCR-ABL
qPCR every 3 months, and bone marrow biopsy every 6 months until major
molecular remission is achieved. Once molecular remission is documented, BCRABL transcripts should still be followed every 3 months, with an annual bone
marrow exam for cytogenetics. Rising BCR-ABL transcripts should be quickly
reevaluated and treatment altered accordingly.

CHRONIC LYMPHOCYTIC LEUKEMIA
521

GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is characterized by the progressive
accumulation of monoclonal, functionally incompetent lymphocytes. Patients with
CLL commonly develop complications associated with the intrinsic immune
dysfunction that results in immunodeficiency and the development of autoimmune
disorders. CLL is considered to be identical to the mature (peripheral) B-cell
neoplasm small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL).

Classification

Classification of CLL is based on the extent of systemic infiltration of
522

lymphocytes. This helps to determine the prognosis and initiation of treatment (Table
29-5). Molecular and cytogenetic markers have become increasingly useful for
prognostication.
Epidemiology

CLL is the most common form of leukemia in adults, accounting for ~30% of
adult leukemia in Western countries. According to the SEER cancer database, from
2000 to 2003 the median age at presentation was 72 years, and only 13% of patients
were <55 years old at the time of diagnosis. Nearly 4% of elderly individuals have a
monoclonal lymphocytosis, although most of these do not progress to CLL. The ageadjusted incidence rate for CLL was 3.8 per 100,000 per year, with a ~2:1
male:female ratio.
Pathophysiology

CLL is an accumulation of malignant, immunologically incompetent, but mature
B-cell lymphocytes. The malignant cells of CLL express high levels of the
antiapoptotic protein, bcl-2, and express common B-cell antigens CD19, CD20, and
CD23. Of note, CD5 antigen, a T-cell antigen, is found in all cases of CLL. A
Coombs-positive, warm antibody, hemolytic anemia occurs in 10% of patients, and
an immune thrombocytopenia occurs in ~5% of patients. In 5% of patients, Richter
syndrome develops, which is a malignant transformation to diffuse large B-cell
lymphoma.
Risk Factors

Patients with a history of immunodeficiency syndromes have an increased risk
of CLL. There are no clear environmental or occupational risk factors that
predispose to CLL, and patients who are exposed to radiation do not appear to have
an increased frequency of CLL.
DIAGNOSIS

Clinical Presentation

Many patients are discovered by routine CBC and are asymptomatic. However,
chronic fatigue is a common initial complaints. With bone marrow involvement,
patients may develop severe fatigue, anemia, bruising, weight loss, and fever. On
523

physical exam, splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, and lymphadenopathy can be present.
With advancing immunodeficiency, herpes zoster infections, Pneumocystis jiroveci
pneumonia, and bacterial infections become more frequent.
Diagnostic Criteria

The essential diagnostic criteria for CLL identified by the CLL international
working group include an absolute lymphocytosis of >5000/μL with a typical
morphology, a bone marrow infiltrated with small lymphocytes accounting for >30%
of nucleated cells, and a typical immunophenotype (CD5+, CD23+, CD10−, CD19+,
CD20+dim, CyclinD1−, CD43±) (Table 29-6).
Differential Diagnosis

It is important to consider benign causes of lymphocytosis, including Epstein–
Barr virus mononucleosis, chronic infections, autoimmune diseases, drug and
allergic reactions, thyrotoxicosis, adrenal insufficiency, and postsplenectomy. The
other possible malignancies to consider are hairy cell leukemia (HCL), cutaneous Tcell lymphoma, other indolent non-Hodgkin lymphomas (mantle cell, follicular,
lymphoplasmacytic), and large granular lymphocytic leukemia.

Diagnostic Testing

524

A CBC with differential reveals an absolute lymphocytosis, with >95% small
lymphocytes. A blood smear should show mature lymphocytes. The classic smudge
cell is nonspecific, but more than 30% smudging has been suggested as a poor
prognostic marker. Anemia and/or thrombocytopenia may be present from bone
marrow infiltration or from an autoimmune phenomenon. It is important to assess
renal and hepatic function, LDH, uric acid, beta-2-microglobulin, Coombs antiglobulin, serum protein electrophoresis, quantitative immunoglobulins, chest
radiograph, and CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis. Patients with CLL
typically have at least 30% lymphocytes in the bone marrow. A bone marrow
biopsy should be obtained for cytogenetics. Cytogenetic markers have been noted to
predict overall progression of disease and response to therapy. Important molecular
markers include ZAP70 and IgVH (immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region)
gene rearrangements.
TREATMENT

It is not necessary to initiate therapy early in the course of CLL. However, CLL
patients may be immunocompromised, and fever or any other signs of infection
need to be evaluated promptly. Indications for therapy include eligibility for a
clinical trial, symptoms (fevers, sweats, weight loss), obstructive or advancing
lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, stage III or IV disease, rapid elevation
in lymphocyte count with a doubling time <6 months, and complications
including immune hemolysis, thrombocytopenia, recurrent infections, threatened
organ function, and transformation.
There is no agreed upon standard treatment regimen for symptomatic CLL.9
Treatment options include purine analogs (e.g., fludarabine, pentostatin),
alkylating agents (e.g., chlorambucil, bendamustine), monoclonal antibodies
(e.g., rituximab, alemtuzumab), or combinations of these agents. These
treatment options have not been directly compared with each other. When
prospective randomized trials have been performed, most of these regimens
have been compared with chlorambucil, an alkylating agent that had been a
standard of care for decades. While overall survival rates with these different
regimens are similar, they differ in their rates of complete remission (CR), time
to progression, and associated toxicities. For example, randomized clinical
trials have established higher CR rates and progression-free survival intervals
for fludarabine over alkylating agents, and for combination therapies such as
FC (fludarabine, cyclophosphamide) over fludarabine alone; however, no
525

difference in overall survival has been demonstrated. With elevated leukocyte
counts, consideration of tumor lysis risk and prevention is important prior to
therapeutic intervention. In addition, patients treated with purine analogs should
be considered for prophylaxis against Pneumocystis and varicella zoster.
Patients with del(17p) or del(11q) are at high risk of either not responding to
initial treatment, or relapsing soon after achieving remission.10 The appropriate
treatment for these patients remains undefined at this time. Options include
Initial treatment with fludarabine combinations, followed by alemtuzumab,
either after a number of cycles of initial debulking chemotherapy, or at the
time of relapse.
Consideration of non-myeloablative allogeneic hematopoietic cell
transplantation for younger patients with a matched related or matched
unrelated donor.
Alemtuzumab is the only FDA-approved agent that has demonstrated activity in
cells lacking p53 function, as seen in patients with CLL and chromosome 17p
deletion.
Refractory and relapsed disease may be treated with retreatment of prior
agents, if relapse is >12 months, or with further combination therapy. 11 FCR
(fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, rituximab) and PCR (pentostatin,
cyclophosphamide, rituximab) have both shown response rates of 30% to 60%
in fludarabine-pretreated populations. Alemtuzumab is showing increasing
promise as a single or combined agent in refractory disease.
Autologous and allogeneic bone marrow transplantations are being explored as
treatment options. Improved results have been noted with nonmyeloablative
therapies. Young patients with high-risk disease should be considered for this
therapy.
COMPLICATIONS

Autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) and autoimmune thrombocytopenia
occur more frequently in advanced-stage patients and those with unmutated
IgVH. These complications should be evaluated with reticulocyte count,
haptoglobin, LDH, and Coombs assay. The results should be interpreted in
context of other features, as the reticulocyte count may be low due to bone
marrow suppression or infiltration, the LDH may be elevated due to the
disease, not hemolysis, and treatments such as fludarabine may induce AIHA by
themselves. Treatment is typical of other AIHA and autoimmune
526

thrombocytopenia processes with prednisone or equivalent glucocorticoid at a
dose of 1 mg/kg/d, tapered after control of blood counts. Splenectomy may be
needed if the blood counts do not improve on steroids. Local irradiation or
splenectomy can control the effects of hypersplenism.
Infection can result from hypogammaglobulinemia, T-cell dysfunction, and
decreased phagocytic function. Hypogammaglobulinemic patients with
recurrent infections should be treated with intravenous immunoglobulin, 400
mg/kg IV, every 3 to 4 weeks (goal IgG trough, ~500 mg/dL), which reduces
serious bacterial infection rates without altering overall survival. Patients
treated with fludarabine or alemtuzumab develop therapy-related T-cell
immune defects and are at a significantly increased risk of cytomegalovirus
(CMV) reactivation, Pneumocystis, varicella zoster, herpes viruses, Listeria,
and other opportunistic infections. Prophylaxis against Pneumocystis, herpes
simplex virus, and varicella zoster virus, as well as monitoring for CMV
reactivation should be considered when treating CLL patients with these agents.
PROGNOSIS
Diffuse marrow involvement, rapidly increasing lymphocyte counts, and initial
lymphocytosis of >50,000/μL indicate a poor prognosis for an individual patient
with early-stage disease. Anemia and thrombocytopenia correspond with decreased
median survival time. Overall, CLL is an indolent disease, and median survivals of
>10 years are reported in stages 0, I, and II. Thus, patients may die of other
conditions rather than from CLL. However, if a patient presents with advanced
disease, the course may be rapid, with a median survival of months to years. It is
unclear whether cytotoxic therapy improves survival, although it can effectively
palliate disease-related symptoms. Advances in supportive care and infection
therapy have improved survival and quality of life.

HAIRY CELL LEUKEMIA

GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Hairy cell leukemia (HCL) is an uncommon chronic B-cell lymphoproliferative
disorder originally termed “leukemic reticuloendotheliosis” in the 1920s. It was
527

described as a distinct clinical entity by Bouroncle and colleagues in 1958, and
named HCL in the 1960s because of the prominent irregular cytoplasmic projections
of the malignant cells. It accounts for 2% to 3% of all leukemias, usually affecting
men >55 years old.
DIAGNOSIS

Clinical Presentation

Most patients present with malaise and fatigue. On physical exam, splenomegaly
and hepatomegaly are evident in 95% and 40%, respectively. With more advanced
disease, pancytopenia develops, and patients may present with bleeding or recurrent
infections (bacterial, viral, fungal, or atypical mycobacterial).
Diagnostic Testing

A peripheral smear and bone marrow reveal the pathognomonic mononuclear
cells. These cells have characteristic irregular hairlike projections around the
border of the cytoplasm. CBC frequently shows anemia and thrombocytopenia and,
less frequently, granulocytopenia. Although bone marrow aspiration is frequently
unsuccessful, the biopsy may show the characteristic hairy cells. Hairy cells exhibit
a mature B cell phenotype and typically express one or more heavy chains and
monotypic light chains. Hairy cells strongly express pan-B cell antigens including
CD19, CD20, CD22, and CD25, and usually lack expression of CD5, CD10, CD21,
and CD23, and characteristically express CD11c, CD103, CD123, cyclin D1, and
annexin A1. Also, hairy cells are TRAP (tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase)
positive. Hairy cell leukemia is differentiated from CLL, lymphomas, and monocytic
leukemia based on the characteristic cell morphology, TRAP test, and immune
phenotype. There is no formal staging system.
TREATMENT
As with other chronic leukemias and lymphomas, early treatment does not
improve overall outcome. The decision to treat is based on the development of
cytopenias (hemoglobin, <10 g/dL, absolute neutrophil count, <1000/μL; platelets,
<100,000/μL) and recurrent infections. Several treatment options are available
(Table 29-7). Typically, cladribine or pentostatin is used. However, both of these
528

agents induce significant and prolonged immunosuppression. Prophylaxis for herpes
simplex virus and Pneumocystis, especially if concurrent steroids are used, is
advised.

OUTCOME/PROGNOSIS
Before treatment, median survival was between 5 and 10 years. Survival has
markedly improved with current therapies, as most untreated and pretreated patients
have excellent response rates to cladribine or pentostatin (85% to 97%), with 4-year
survival rates of up to 96%.

INTRODUCTION
Lymphoma refers to a clonal tumor arising from the malignant transformation of
mature or immature lymphocytes (B cells, T cells, or natural-killer (NK) cells). It
represents the most common hematologic malignancy, and is a heterogeneous
disease, comprised of over 30 subtypes as classified by the World Health
Organization (WHO).1 This diversity derives from the varied pathways leading to
lymphoma, including the transformation of different lymphocyte types, at different
developmental or differentiation stages, and through multiple molecular pathways.
Lymphoma can be subdivided into two clinically distinct classes: Hodgkin
lymphoma (HL) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL).

HODGKIN LYMPHOMA

GENERAL PRINCIPLES
HL is a clonal neoplasm derived from B lymphocytes. It accounts for 30% of
lymphomas in the United States. It is defined by the presence of characteristic
Hodgkin Reed–Sternberg (HRS) cells located in the appropriate cellular
background.
Classification

The WHO classification groups nodular sclerosis, mixed cellularity,
531

lymphocyte-deplete, and lymphocyte-rich subtypes together as classical HL (cHL),
based on pathologic and clinical similarities. Nodular lymphocyte-predominant
HL (NLPHL) represents a distinct clinical entity with unique pathologic
characteristics and a more indolent clinical course1 (Table 30-1).
Epidemiology

There are 160,000 patients living with HL in the United States, with an annual
incidence rate of 2.8 per 100,000. cHL accounts for 95% of HL cases, and has a
bimodal age distribution with a peak at 15 to 35 years and a second peak later in
life. NLPHL accounts for 5% of HL, has a male predominance, and occurs most
frequently in adults age 30 to 50.1
Pathophysiology

The malignant B cell in HL is the HRS cell, which is large, bi- or
multinucleated, and expresses CD30 and CD15 cell surface antigens. NLPHL is
characterized by a clonal B-cell population composed of lymphocytic and histiocytic
cells (LHC) that express CD45, CD20, and CD79a.

Risk Factors

Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) is a clear risk factor for HL. Patients with a history
of infectious mononucleosis have a higher incidence of HL, although the frequency of
EBV positivity varies with geographic region. Human immunodeficiency virus
(HIV) predisposes to the development of EBV-associated HL, likely through
alterations in immune surveillance.
DIAGNOSIS

532

Clinical Presentation

HL typically presents as asymptomatic enlarged lymph nodes, with the disease
originating in one lymph node group and spreading in a contiguous pattern. In older
patients (>50 years), there may be a “skipped” lymph node segment. Sixty percent of
patients present with localized (stage I-II) disease based on the modified Ann Arbor
staging system. The most commonly involved lymph node groups are cervical (75%)
and mediastinal (60%). Extranodal sites of involvement include the spleen (20%),
bone marrow (5%), lung, and liver, and patients may present with symptoms specific
to site of involvement. Systemic B symptoms of fever (>38.5°C), night sweats, and
weight loss (>10% of body weight over 6 months) occur in up to 40% of patients.
Patients with HIV associated HL usually present with advanced stage disease, extranodal site involvement, and B symptoms.
History

Painless lymphadenopathy is the hallmark of HL. Intense pruritus is reported in
up to 25% of patients. Patients with mediastinal disease may report cough, chest
pain, or shortness of breath. Other rare symptoms which may be elucidated from the
history include pain in enlarged lymph nodes after alcohol ingestion and periodic
fever. Performance status should be determined from the history.
Physical Examination

The physical examination should focus on the number, size, location, and
character of palpable lymph nodes. The cervical nodes are most commonly
involved, and the disease tends to spread in a contiguous pattern. The abdominal
examination may reveal hepatosplenomegaly.
Differential Diagnosis

The differential diagnosis of suspected lymphoma typically includes other causes
of lymphadenopathy. Infections, systemic rheumatologic disorders, or metastatic
malignancies can also cause peripheral lymph node enlargement. For patients
presenting with isolated splenomegaly, other etiologies include infection, portal
hypertension, storage diseases, metastatic tumors, autoimmune disorders and
myeloproliferative disorders.

533

Diagnostic Testing

A large excisional lymph node biopsy is preferred for the diagnosis of HL. In
addition to morphologic evaluation, immunohistochemistry may be helpful in
differentiating the CD15 +, CD30 + HRS of cHL from the CD45 +, CD20 + LHC
cells of NLPHL. Bone marrow biopsy should be performed in advanced stage
disease or in the presence of cytopenias or B symptoms.
Laboratories

Complete blood cell count (CBC) with differential, erythrocyte
sedimentation rate (ESR), and a complete metabolic panel (CMP) should be
obtained at diagnosis. ESR, white blood cell and lymphocyte counts, hemoglobin,
and albumin are important for calculation of a patient’s international prognostic
score (IPS), which can be used to estimate survival in cHL (Table 30-2).2
Pregnancy testing in women of child-bearing age and HIV testing in at risk patients is
indicated.
534

Imaging

Positive emission tomography (PET) is preferred over computed tomography
(CT) scan for initial imaging in HL. PET is more sensitive for detecting additional
sites of disease and may improve the accuracy of the stage of disease as determined
by the modified Ann Arbor staging system (Table 30-3). In some cases, serial PET
imaging during therapy can be used to assess early response and prognosis, which
can help guide clinicians in determining need for dose escalation and duration of
therapy.3 Pulmonary function testing should also be performed in patients who will
receive chemotherapy containing bleomycin (see treatment, below).

TREATMENT

Early stage cHL (stages I/II, no B symptoms, no bulky disease). Early stage
cHL has a good prognosis when treated with standard therapy, with high rates
of complete remission (CR) and 5 year overall survival (OS) greater than
535

90%.4 The focus of current clinical investigation is on maintaining excellent
disease results while minimizing long-term complications of therapy. Standard
treatment approaches (Table 30-4) include combined modality therapy with
ABVD chemotherapy × 2 to 4 cycles plus involved field radiotherapy (IFRT)
or chemotherapy alone with ABVD × 4 to 6 cycles. Recent evidence suggests
that patients with early stage disease without adverse prognostic factors may
receive reduced intensity radiotherapy with similar outcomes to full dose
therapy. Patients at the highest risk for complications of IFRT (e.g., age <30
years, smokers, CAD risk factors, family history of early breast cancer) should
be considered for treatment with chemotherapy alone.5
Advanced-stage cHL (stages III/IV, B symptoms, bulky stage II). Standard
treatment of advanced cHL includes systemic chemotherapy with ABVD × 6 to
8 cycles. Consolidative radiotherapy is typically recommended for all patients
with bulky (>10 cm) disease. This approach results in 5- and 15-year failurefree survival rates of ~60% and ~45%, respectively, and 5- and 15-year OS
rates of ~75% and ~60%. Alternative regimens include Stanford V and doseescalated BEACOPP. These regimens are more intense with slightly higher CR
rates, but increased toxicity, and may be utilized in patients with poor risk
disease.6–8
Relapsed cHL. The approach to patients with relapsed cHL takes into account
the primary therapy and duration of remission. Historically, patients with earlystage HL were treated with radiation therapy alone; these patients are excellent
candidates for standard systemic chemotherapy for cHL, which results in longterm DFS in 50% to 80%. Patients who received initial chemo-therapy and
relapse late (>1 year after remission) may be considered for standard dose
chemotherapy, resulting in 30% to 50% long-term DFS. Patients who relapse
early (<1 year after remission) or those with poor prognostic factors (e.g.,
stages III/IV at relapse, B symptoms) should be treated with aggressive salvage
chemotherapy (e.g., ICE, ESHAP) and be considered for high-dose
chemotherapy with autologous stem cell transplant (SCT). This can result in
long-term DFS in 40%. Patients who relapse after autologous SCT should be
considered for clinical and, in appropriate candidates, allogeneic SCT.9
NLPHL is a distinct HL subtype best characterized as an indolent B-cell
lymphoma with a good prognosis. Most patients present with stage I disease,
for which IFRT alone should be considered. Trials with single agent rituximab
have also shown promising results. For advanced-stage presentation, treatment
with systemic chemotherapy in combination with rituximab has favorable
results.10
536

COMPLICATIONS
Short-term adverse effects depend on the chemotherapy regimen used. The most
common short-term complication of ABVD is myelosuppression, leading to
cytopenias and an increased risk of infections. Lung injury due to bleomycin or
radiotherapy may occur acutely, and the highest risk is in patients who are older,
smokers, or have underlying lung disease. Long-term toxicities include secondary
malignancies, which occur in 25% of patients and may be delayed by decades;
patients treated with radiation therapy are at the highest risk. Hypothyroidism occurs
in 50% of neck radio-therapy patients at 1 to 20 years after treatment. The risk of
CAD is highest in patients irradiated when <30 years of age. The risk of infertility
and secondary MDS/leukemia is low with standard ABVD chemotherapy but higher
in patients who receive dose-intensive regimens.
FOLLOW-UP
During the first 2 years after obtaining a complete CR, routine follow-up
includes history and physical examination, CBC, ESR, and CMP at 3-month
intervals. Imaging is performed at 1 and 2 years post-remission and as clinically
indicated. After 2 years, office visits and laboratories may be spaced out to every 6
months for the first 5 years. Additional surveillance is required for patients who
received radiation therapy. Thyroid screening tests should be performed annually in
patients who received radiation involving the neck. Surveillance for solid tumors
(cancers of the skin, soft tissue, breast, and lung) should begin 5 to 10 years
following therapy and continue for the lifetime of the patient.

537

NON-HODGKIN LYMPHOMA

GENERAL PRINCIPLES
NHL is an umbrella diagnosis that encompasses all lymphomas which do not
meet HL criteria. It is composed of a diverse group of diseases that range from
indolent to aggressive in nature. Given this heterogeneity, a detailed discussion of
each NHL subtype is beyond the scope of this chapter. This section will review
general information about NHL, focusing on follicular lymphoma (FL) and diffuse
large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Together these two entities account for twothirds of NHL. Other specific NHL subtypes of interest are described at the end of
this section under “Special Considerations.”
Classification

The WHO classification subdivides NHL based on morphologic,
immunophenotypic, genetic, and clinical features. Subtypes are grouped into
precursor lymphoid neoplasms, mature B-cell neoplasms, or mature T- and NK-cell
neoplasms based on their resemblance to normal stages of lymphocyte differentiation
(Table 30-5). Precursor neoplasms are primarily diseases of childhood. Mature Tand NK-cell neoplasms are uncommon diseases accounting for only 12% of NHL.
Mature B-cell neoplasms (including FL and DLBCL) account for greater than 90%
of lymphoid neoplasms worldwide, and are by far the most common type of NHL in
adults.1
Epidemiology

There are an estimated 430,000 patients in the United States with NHL. The
incidence has been rising over the last 30 years, with an annual incidence of 30 per
100,000 and a death rate of 7 per 100,000 in the United States. Most mature B-cell
NHLs have median ages in the 6th to 7th decades of life, although a few subtypes
(e.g., primary mediastinal lymphoma) occur at younger ages.1
Pathophysiology

The genetic hallmark of FL is the translocation t(14;18)(q32;q21), present in
over 90% of cases. This translocation places the anti-apoptotic BCL-2 gene under in
538

the influence of the immunoglobulin (Ig) heavy chain gene enhancer, resulting in
increased expression of BCL-2. Accumulation of additional karyotypic
abnormalities is common in FL. Mutation of the BCL-6 gene on chromosome 3q27 is
the most frequent genetic aberration in DLBCL, occurring in 40% of cases. BCL-6 is
a transcription factor that regulates the genes involved in lymphocyte development
and apoptosis.
Risk Factors

HIV infection, immunosuppressant therapy, and primary immune deficiency are
associated with an increased risk of NHL. Certain autoimmune diseases (e.g.,
Hashimoto’s thyroiditis) are also risk factors. Viral pathogens that have been linked
to NHL subtypes include HIV, EBV, human herpresvirus-8, human T-cell leukemia
virus type I, and hepatitis C virus. The most notable bacterial association is of
Helicobacter pylori infection with gastric MALT lymphomas.

539

DIAGNOSIS

Clinical Presentation

Presenting symptoms in NHL vary with subtype and sites of involvement.
Painless lymphadenopathy is the most common presentation. Systemic B symptoms
are present in 33% of patients with DLBCL and 28% of patients with FL.
540

Extranodal involvement, more common in DLBCL, may include bone marrow,
skin, gastrointestinal tract, testes, salivary glands, liver, spleen, breast, adrenals,
bone, sinuses, and CNS. Patients with bulky retroperitoneal disease may present
with vague abdominal complaints.
Physical Examination

The physical examination should focus on the number, size, location, and
character of palpable lymph nodes. Lymph node chains which should be examined
include cervical, submental, supraclavicular, infraclavicular, axillary, epitrochlear,
inguinal, and femoral as well as examination of Waldeyer ring (tonsils, oropharynx).
The abdominal examination should include assessment for hepatic and splenic
enlargement. Any patient with back pain or neurologic symptoms should have a
complete neurologic examination to evaluate for cord compression or CNS
involvement with lymphoma.
Differential Diagnosis

Other causes of peripheral lymphadenopathy include infection, rheumatologic
disease, or other malignancy and may mimic NHL. See discussion in HL section.
Diagnostic Testing

When lymphoma is suspected, an incisional or excisional biopsy is preferred.
An adequate biopsy specimen is critical for morphologic review and assessment of
architecture by the pathologist. It also provides material for ancillary studies which
may aid in subclassification, such as flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry, and
genetic tests. Bilateral bone marrow biopsy and aspiration are required. If CNS
involvement is suspected, lumbar puncture should be performed.
Laboratories

CBC may reveal cytopenias suggestive of bone marrow involvement. A CMP
should be ordered to assess creatinine and calcium and to establish baseline liver
function. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) is an important prognostic indicator. If
tumor lysis syndrome is suspected, particularly in highly aggressive lymphomas
(e.g., Burkitt lymphoma), serial assessment of uric acid, potassium, calcium,
phosphorus and creatinine is important during initial treatment.
Imaging

CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis should be performed with contrast to
541

complete staging. Sites of lymph node involvement are classified by the modified
Ann Arbor staging system (Table 30-3). An initial PET is useful for aggressive,
potentially curable NHL subtypes such as DLBCL, as it may detect additional sites
of disease. PET is not routinely recommended for indolent or incurable lymphomas,
such as FL.3 If anthracycline-based chemotherapy is considered, assessment of left
ventricular function with a multiple-gated acquisition (MUGA) scan or a
transthoracic 2-D echocardiogram is warranted.
TREATMENT

Follicular lymphoma (FL) is an indolent lymphoma with a median survival of
7 to 10 years in historical reports; survival is probably improving with modern
therapy. Treatment with chemotherapy typically results in initial response
followed by repeated relapses. Transformation to high-grade (large cell) NHL
sometimes occurs. Given its indolent course, many patients with FL can be
observed safely without treatment. Up to 20% of patients may never require
therapy. The “watchful waiting” approach does not alter OS, but requires a
reliable patient and clinical follow up every 3 to 6 months. Indications for
treatment include symptomatic disease, bulky lymphadenopathy, threatened endorgan damage, cytopenias, and eligibility for clinical trials.
Early stage (I/II) FL occurs in a minority of patients. It has a good
prognosis when treated with IFRT alone, or in combination with
immunochemotherapy such as R-CHOP (Table 30-6). Ten year OS ranges
from 50% to 70%.11
Advanced stage FL (III, IV or bulky stage II). Rituximab containing
regimens improve PFS over chemotherapy alone in advanced stage FL.
CHOP, CVP, FND, fludarabine or bendamustine plus rituximab are all
effective, with three-year PFS ranging from 50% to 70%. Although there
is no clear superiority of one regimen, R-CHOP and R-CVP are common
initial choices, with high remission rates and long median PFS.12,13 Recent
data suggests that Bendamustine-R may have higher rates of PFS than RCHOP. For elderly patients or those with poor performance status, single
agent therapy with rituximab or chlorambucil may be used. Following
induction chemotherapy, consolidation with radioimmunotherapy or
maintenance rituximab may be considered.14
Relapsed FL. Treatment of relapsed disease depends on prior therapies
and the length of time since last treatment. Patients who initially receive
542

R-chemotherapy and relapse less than one year from initial therapy are
considered for aggressive salvage approaches. Alternative treatment
regimens
include
other
R-chemotherapy
combinations,
radioimmunotherapy, and autologous or allogeneic SCT.
Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is an aggressive but potentially
curable lymphoma. The majority of patients present with advanced disease, but
a small number have limited disease on presentation.
Advanced Stage (III/IV) DLBCL. Standard initial therapy for advanced
stage disease includes combination immunochemotherapy with R-CHOP,
typically administered for 6 to 8 cycles, resulting in 5-year OS rates of
58%.15 In contrast to FL, maintenance rituximab has no role in DLBCL.
Patients with an increased risk of central nervous system relapse
(involvement of testicular, paranasal sinus, epidural, bone marrow, or
greater than two extra-nodal sites) should receive CNS prophylaxis.
Limited Stage (I/II) DLBCL. Twenty-five percent of patients have
limited disease at presentation. These patients have a good prognosis,
with 5-year OS estimates of 70% to 80% with standard therapy. Treatment
options include combined modality therapy with three cycles of RCHOP
followed by IFRT, or R-CHOP for 6 to 8 cycles with or without IFRT.
Patients with bulky stage II disease (tumor size greater than 10 cm in
greatest dimension) have a worse prognosis and are often treated as
advanced stage disease.16,17
Relapsed DLBCL. Patients who relapse after CR should be considered
for high dose chemotherapy and autologous SCT. 18 Common salvage
chemotherapy regimens include DHAP, ESHAP, and ICE with or without
rituximab.

543

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS

Transformation to aggressive lymphoma. Indolent NHL patients have a 1% to
3% per year risk of transforming into aggressive NHL (most commonly
DLBCL). Transformation may manifest as rapid enlargement of a single lymph
node group, sudden rise in LDH, decline in performance status, hypercalcemia,
or new extranodal involvement. Transformed NHL can occur regardless of
treatment approach for the indolent NHL and has a poor prognosis. The optimal
therapy is unclear and these patients are encouraged to enroll in a clinical trial.
If a trial is not available, they are typically treated similarly to patients with
high-risk, relapsed DLBCL.
Marginal zone lymphomas. These commonly present with localized disease
(approximately two-thirds) involving the GI tract, thyroid, orbit/conjunctiva,
544

lung, breast, or salivary glands. Gastric MALT lymphomas are associated with
H. pylori, and complete responses are seen after antibiotic therapy aimed at
eradicating the infection. At other sites, early-stage disease has an excellent
prognosis with IFRT alone. Advanced-stage MALT lymphomas are treated
with chemotherapy, similarly to FL. Splenic marginal-zone lymphoma also has
an excellent prognosis, and first-line therapy involves splenectomy or singleagent rituximab, both of which may result in a high rate of CR and long-term
DFS. Nodal and extranodal marginal-zone lymphomas are treated in a similar
fashion to FL.
Mantle cell lymphoma. Mantle cell lymphoma is an aggressive NHL
characterized by t(11;14), a translocation that results in the overexpression of
cyclin D1, a protein involved in cell cycle regulation. Most patients present
with advanced disease. Cure rates are low with standard aggressive NHL
therapy, and in appropriate candidates, aggressive chemotherapy regimens are
warranted, preferably as part of a clinical trial. Typical off-study approaches
include rituximab plus hyper-CVAD or autologous stem cell transplant.
Burkitt lymphoma. Burkitt lymphoma/leukemia is a highly aggressive NHL
that may be endemic (e.g., equatorial Africa), associated with
immunodeficiency (HIV), or sporadic (most common in the United States). The
sporadic form is characterized by overexpression of the c-myc proto-oncogene,
usually via the t(8;14) translocation. This NHL is rapidly life-threatening
without therapy, has a poor prognosis, commonly involves the bone marrow
and CNS, and is treated with aggressive combination chemotherapy (e.g.,
hyper-CVAD regimen) with CNS prophylaxis.
Lymphoblastic lymphoma. Lymphoblastic lymphoma is another highly
aggressive NHL. This disease is treated identically to ALL, with intensive
chemotherapy, and also requires CNS prophylaxis. Prognosis is good for earlystage disease and intermediate for advanced-stage disease, with ~80% and
~50% chance of long-term DFS, respectively.
Small lymphocytic lymphoma. This is considered to be part of the same
disease process as chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and is treated as such. See
Chapter 29.
Primary CNS lymphoma. This is an aggressive NHL that presents with
isolated CNS disease and, if untreated, has a rapidly fatal natural history.
Compared to systemic DLBCL, its prognosis is worse, and treatment
approaches include radiation therapy and/or chemotherapy that penetrates into
the CNS (e.g., high-dose methotrexate).
Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma/mycosis fungoides. Cutaneous T-cell lymphomas
typically present as erythematous plaques or exfoliation of skin but may
545

progress to involve lymph nodes. They are treated with topical medications
(steroids, retinoids, chemotherapy), local radiation, PUVA therapy, oral
methotrexate and retinoids, interferon, and, at advanced stages, combination
chemotherapy.
Anaplastic large-cell lymphoma. This aggressive NHL typically involves both
nodal and extranodal sites (e.g., skin, lung, bone, soft tissues) and is
characterized by overexpression of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-1,
usually via a t(2;5) translocation. The presence of ALK-1 confers a much more
favorable prognosis, compared with ALK-1-negative cases. Standard treatment
is anthracycline-containing combination chemotherapy similar to DLBCL (e.g.,
CHOP), with 70% long-term DFS).
FOLLOW-UP
Follow-up for DLBCL during the first 2 years after obtaining a remission
includes H&P, CBC, LDH, and complete metabolic panel at 3-month intervals, with
imaging typically repeated at 1 and 2 years and as clinically indicated. After 2 years,
follow-up intervals may be lengthened, and after 5 to 10 years without relapse,
patients may be followed by their primary care physician. For indolent NHL,
follow-up is typically every 3 to 4 months, with imaging repeated annually and as
clinically indicated.
PROGNOSIS
The prognosis of NHL is determined by multiple factors but starts with defining
the subtype of NHL. In general, indolent NHLs are not considered curable, while
aggressive NHL patients have a significant chance for long-term DFS after initial
therapy. The international prognostic index (IPI) was developed to help predict
CR and long-term survival in aggressive NHL such as DLBCL at a time when
CHOP-like chemotherapy was standard treatment. The IPI factors were used to
develop a revised IPI to provide prognostic information with current front-line
treatment approaches that combine rituximab with CHOP chemotherapy (Table 307).19 The follicular lymphoma IPI (FLIPI) was developed to define overall
prognosis in FL (Table 30-8), and results have shown that this index is useful in
patients treated with current chemotherapy.11

INTRODUCTION
Adult hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) have two main characteristics: they are
able to make identical copies of themselves for long periods of time (known as longterm self-renewal), and they can give rise to mature cells with specialized functions.
Primitive stem cells create intermediate cells called precursor cells. Under specific
signals these cells divide and become differentiated cells that finally mature to
specialized blood cells.
More than 30,000 autologous transplantations and more than 25,000 allogeneic
transplantations are performed annually worldwide.1
Sources of Hematopoietic Stem Cells

HSC transplant (HSCT) is a general term referring to the reconstitution of a
patient’s hematopoietic system by the administration of stored HSCs. The most
common source of HSCs in adults is peripheral blood, accounting for ~70% of
transplants. Cells are collected from peripheral blood through a process known as
apheresis after mobilization of stem cells from the bone marrow into the peripheral
circulation. Bone marrow is a source of HSCs in 20% of adult transplants. Cells are
harvested directly from the bone marrow, usually from the iliac crests, under general
anesthesia. Umbilical cord blood HSCs are currently used in 10% of transplants in
adults, and the results are comparable to those achieved with adult unrelated donors
(Fig. 31-1).2
Types of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplants

HSC transplants are divided into allogeneic and autologous transplants,
depending on the relationship between the recipient and the donor.
551

Allogeneic transplant, where the donor is different from the recipient,
can be classified as sibling-derived or matched unrelated donor.
The two main sources of matched unrelated donor transplants are adult
unrelated donors and umbilical cord blood. In addition to the effect
of the preparative high-dose chemo-therapy, the antitumoral effect of
allogeneic transplants is mediated by the graft-versus-tumor effect
(GvT), which consists in the immune destruction of residual tumor cells
by the donor’s immune system. Syngeneic transplant is a sibling
donor transplant from patient’s identical twin. Because of absence of
GvHD, transplant related mortality associated with syngeneic
transplantation is significantly lower than matched unrelated donor
transplant. However because of lower GVT effect, relapse rate is
substantially higher than similar patients who receive HLA-identical
sibling donor transplantation; as a result overall survival is similar in
syngeneic and HLA identical sibling donor transplants. In general, sibling
transplants suffer fewer problems with rejection and graft-versus-host
disease (GvHD) than matched unrelated donor transplants, and thus,
recipients of the latter usually need more intensive immunosuppressive
therapy in the posttransplant period (see Complications Related to
Transplant, below).

552

FIGURE 31-1. Number and source of adult transplants facilitated by national
marrow donor program. (Ballen KK, King RJ, Chitphakdithai P, et al. The national
marrow donor program 20 years of unrelated donor hematopoietic cell
transplantation. Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2008;14:2–7.)
Autologous transplant refers to the infusion of a patient’s own HSCs to
reconstitute all of the hematopoietic lineages. This approach is used to
allow very high doses of chemotherapy to be administered. Infusion of
autologous HSCs rescues a patient’s bone marrow function from the
effects of the myeloablative doses of chemotherapy.
Indications

Indications for autologous stem cell transplantation include malignancies
(multiple myeloma, non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, Hodgkin lymphoma, acute myeloid
leukemia, neuroblastoma, germ-cell tumors) and nonmalignant disorders
(autoimmune disorders and amyloidosis). Indications for allogeneic stem cell
transplantation include malignancies (leukemia, non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma,
myelodysplastic syndromes) and nonmalignant disorders (aplastic anemia,
553

paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, fanconi’s anemia, Blackfan–Diamond anemia,
thalassemia major, sickle cell anemia, severe combined immunodeficiency,
Wiskott–Aldrich syndrome, and inborn errors of metabolism).3 More than 50% of
allogeneic transplantations are performed for treatment of acute leukemias, followed
by NHL (14%), and MDS (14%).
Transplant Immunology

The major determinants of histocompatibility between donor and
recipient, and thus risk for GvHD, are encoded by the human leukocyte
antigen (HLA) system on chromosome 6. These proteins normally
function in antigen presentation in adaptive immunity. The HLA class I
antigens are called A, B, and C and are found on all nucleated cells.
Class II proteins, called DR, DQ, and DP, are found only on dendritic
cells, B lymphocytes, and macrophages. Mismatches at HLA-DP are not
associated with increased mortality. The perfect match is 10/10 HLA-A,
HLA-B, HLA-C, HLA-DR, and HLA-DQ match. With high resolution DNA
based HLA typing overall survival of patients undergoing 10/10 fully
matched transplantations is similar to patients receiving 8/8 HLA-A, HLAB, HLA-C, and HLA-DR matched transplantations.4 According to NMDP
guidelines, the minimal acceptable level of matching is 5 of 6 matches
for HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-DRB.5 Cord blood transplantations have a
lower risk of GvHD. Optimal cord blood transplant is 6/6 matches for
HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-DR.6 The HLA locus can be considered a
haplotype, so that all of the genes on one chromosome are inherited
together (HLA A, B, and DR). Thus, for any given patient, the probability
is one in four that a sibling will share the same two haplotypes and make
a complete match.
Other antigens called minor histocompatibility antigens (MHCs) are
peptides also presented by HLA proteins but that elicit weaker responses
compared to major antigens. These antigens are related to both GvHD
and GvT effect. MHCs expressed only on the recipient HSCs will cause a
GvT effect. MHCs expressed on both epithelial cells and HSCs will cause
both GvHD and GvT.
THE TRANSPLANT PROCEDURE

554

Mobilization and Collection of Hematopoietic Stem Cells

In order to collect the necessary number of HSCs from the donor and to ensure
rapid engraftment in the recipient’s bone marrow, autologous and allogeneic HSCs
are most commonly collected by leukapheresis from the peripheral blood after
pretreatment with drugs that mobilize the HSCs from the bone marrow endosteal and
vascular niches (mobilization). The most extensively studied mobilizing agent is
granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF). For G-CSF, the peak mobilization
occurs after 4 to 6 days of daily treatment. Plerixafor, a small-molecule reversible
CXC chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) inhibitor, can be added to G-CSF to improve
stem cell collection. During the harvest procedure, called apheresis, stem cells are
separated and removed from the other components of the blood by a cell-separator
machine. The cells are then processed and stored for infusion into the patient.
Preparative Regimens

In allogeneic transplants, the traditional preparative regimens are
ablative regimens, consisting of very high doses of chemotherapy drug
combinations intended primarily to eliminate the tumor cells and
secondarily to suppress the donor immune system. Due to the high
toxicity associated with this approach, and in order to extend transplants
to older patients or patients with comorbidities, reduced intensity and
nonmyeloablative regimens have been developed. The basic
principle is to give drugs that are immunosuppressive to allow the GvT
effect.
In the autologous setting, the objective is to give high-dose
chemotherapy to eliminate the tumor cells and then rescue the patient
from aplasia with his or her own previously harvested and stored HSCs.
In this case there is no GvT effect, and the disease control is exclusively
due to the high-dose chemotherapy.
Among the most commonly used drugs are cyclophosphamide, busulfan,
fludarabine, melphalan, etoposide, and antithymocyte globulin. Totalbody irradiation-based regimens combine high-dose chemotherapy with
irradiation to the whole body.
After the conditioning regimen is administered, patients will become
profoundly pancytopenic (absolute neutrophil count, < 100; platelet
count, < 10,000 cells/ μ L) for a period of between 12 and 24 days,
depending on the source of HSCs (autologous or allogeneic) and
preparative regimen used (ablative or nonablative).
555

Homing and Engraftment

After infusion, HSCs migrate to specific sites in the bone marrow called
niches, where they reside and undergo self-renewal and differentiation.
The process of migration and adhesion is called homing. The interaction
between HSC and their niches will result ultimately in engraftment and
long-term durable repopulation.
Neutrophil engraftment is defined as the first day of three
consecutive days where the absolute neutrophil count is ≥500
cells/mm3. Platelet engraftment is defined as an achievement of a
platelet count of >50,000 platelets/mm3 sustained for 3 consecutive
days unsupported by a platelet transfusion. Median time to neutrophil
engraftment after peripheral blood stem cell transplantation, bone
marrow transplantation and cord blood transplantations is 14, 21, and 28
days, respectively. Median time to platelet engraftment after peripheral
blood stem cell transplantation and bone marrow transplantation is 13,
and 20 days, respectively. Median time to neutrophil engraftment after
autologous stem cell transplantation is 11 days. Factors affecting time to
recovery include the use of G-CSF during mobilization and harvest,
degree of pretreatment chemotherapy, use of peripheral blood HSCs
instead of bone marrow HSCs, and presence of infections.
By days 18 to 21, natural killer cells are expanded and will provide
antiviral responses. Within the first 30 days post transplant, natural-killer
(NK) cells reach normal level and comprise the majority of lymphoid
cells. Monocytes typically recover within a month after transplantation. B
lymphocytes and CD8 T lymphocytes will reconstitute over months. CD4
T-lymphocyte recovery is usually prolonged over years (>5 years).7
Donor Lymphocyte Infusions (DLI)

Graft versus tumor mediated by donor T cells is a major component of the
allogeneic HSCT anti tumor activity. DLI is defined as transfusion of nonmobilized
lymphocyte concentrate or transfusion of mobilized peripheral blood stem cells
without using immunosuppressant for GvHD prophylaxis. DLI can induce remissions
in patients with relapse after allogeneic HSCT.8
SUPPORTIVE CARE

556

The posttransplant period is a critical time for patients who have undergone
transplant. They become profoundly pancytopenic. During this time, there is
significant potential morbidity and mortality from infectious agents, drug toxicity,
and bleeding complications. Intensive care in a dedicated unit experienced in HSC
transplant is required to support patients and provide optimal outcome.
Blood Products

All cytomegalovirus (CMV)-seronegative patients should receive CMV-negative
blood and platelet products both prior to and during the transplant period. Blood
products should also be irradiated or leukodepleted to avoid T-cell responses
against host tissue (i.e., GvHD caused by the transfusion). Platelet products derived
from a single donor are preferred to reduce alloantigen exposure.
Growth Factors

For both allogeneic and autologous transplants, hematopoietic growth factors
have shown small reductions in the risk of documented infections, but with no effect
on infection or treatment-related mortality. Specifically, in patients undergoing
allogeneic HSC transplantation for myeloid leukemias, no long-term risk or benefit
of using G-CSF after transplantation has been demonstrated. G-CSF shortens the
post-transplantation neutropenic period by 4 to 5 days, without substantially
affecting the hospitalization period or treatment-related mortality at days +30 and
+100. Probabilities of acute and chronic GvHD, leukemia-free survival, and overall
survival are similar whether or not G-CSF is given.
COMPLICATIONS RELATED TO TRANSPLANT

Graft-versus-Host Disease

GvHD corresponds to an immune response of the donor T cells against
the recipient. It is the main cause of morbidity and mortality after
allogeneic HSC transplants. The exact cause and pathogenesis are still
not completely understood, but it is believed to be caused by a reaction
of donor T cells against the receptor HLA class I antigens. This
inflammatory response is augmented by intestinal damage caused by the
preparative regimens, which cause leakage of bacterial
557

lipopolysaccharides into the bloodstream, increasing and maintaining the
cytokine storm and tissue damage.
GvHD has been divided into two phases, according to the timing of the
symptoms. Acute GvHD occurs within 100 days after the transplant,
and chronic GvHD occurs 100 days or more after the transplant,
although the correlation between the two forms of GvHD is not very well
understood. Moreover, not all cases of chronic GvHD are preceded by
acute GvHD, although acute GvHD is the most important risk factor for
chronic GvHD.
Acute GvHD occurs in 26% to 32% of recipients of sibling donor grafts,
and 42% to 52% of recipients of unrelated donor grafts. It is graded as
stages 0 to IV (most severe) according to the intensity of the symptoms.
The usual organs compromised are the skin, mucous membranes,
gastrointestinal tract, and liver. The risk factors for acute GvHD include
HLA disparity, matched unrelated donors, older patients, gendermismatched HLA, donors previously sensitized by transfusion or
pregnancy, and CMV-positive donors.
The most effective measure to prevent GvHD is an accurate HLA matching
between donor and receptor. Other measures include posttransplant
immunosuppressive drugs (methotrexate, cyclosporine, tacrolimus) and in vivo
and ex vivo T cell depletion.
Once GvHD is established, the first-line treatment remains
corticosteroids. Topical corticosteroids and nonabsorbed steroid therapy are
commonly used for skin GvHD and GI GvHD, respectively. There are a variety
of second-line treatments, which generally have a low response rate.9
Chronic GvHD develops in >50% of long-term survivors after HSC
transplantation and affects both quality of life and survival.
Manifestations resemble autoimmune diseases, suggesting T-cell
immune deregulation, and include dermal, hepatic, ocular, oral,
pulmonary, gastrointestinal, and neuromuscular manifestations.
In contrast to acute GvHD, little is known about the causes and pathobiology of chronic GvHD. Presumably, MHCs are both responsible for and
targets of this disease. It is also believed that chronic T-cell stimulation (as
occurs in acute GvHD) could deregulate T cells, predisposing to chronic
GvHD.
The most important risk factor for chronic GvHD is previous acute GvHD.
Thirty percent of patients with grade 0 acute GvHD, versus 90% of grade
IV acute GvHD patients, will develop chronic GvHD. Among patients with
558

no or grade I acute GvHD, recipient age >20 years, use of non-T-celldepleted bone marrow, and alloimmune female donors for male
recipients predict a greater risk of chronic GvHD.
Prevention of chronic GvHD includes drugs such as cyclosporine,
methotrexate, tacrolimus, corticosteroids, in vivo and ex vivo T cell
depletion, and monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies. First line treatment
of chronic GvHD includes a combination of corticosteroids and a
calcineurin inhibitor (e.g., tacrolimus). Second-line therapies include ECP
and mycophenolate mofetil.10
Sinusoidal Obstruction Syndrome (Veno-occlusive Disease)

Sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (SOS) is a feared complication with a
high mortality rate that can occur after either allogeneic or autologous
transplant. The incidence ranges from 0% to 50%, depending on the
preparative regimen. SOS can occur in up to 50% of patients receiving
high dose cyclophosphamide plus total-body irradiation. Recently, the
frequency and severity of SOS have decreased significantly because of
lower doses of TBI and replacement of cyclophosphamide by fludarabine.
Experimental studies have shown that the main damage occurs in the
hepatic sinusoid.
The major features accepted for diagnosis are jaundice, rising
conjugated bili-rubin, tender hepatomegaly, and ascites with fluid
retention 10 to 20 days after the start of preparative regimen. There are
no other specific lab tests to confirm this complication.11
There is no satisfactory therapy for SOS. In 50% to 80% of patients,
there is a gradual spontaneous resolution of the symptoms and signs in a
3-week period after onset of disease. During this period the focus of
treatment should be management of fluid and electrolytes, and
therapeutic paracentesis. Defibrotide, which has antithrombotic and
profibrinolytic effects, is the best available treatment for sever SOS.
Pulmonary Complications

Pulmonary complications can occur in more than 60% of patients after HSCT. In
the immediate post transplant period, infections (viral, bacterial, and fungal) are
the most common causes of pulmonary complications. After engraftment, infections
(viral, bacterial, and fungal), interstitial pneumonia syndrome (IPS) secondary to
conditioning regimen and/or TBI, and diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH) are the
559

most common causes of pulmonary complications. Bronchiolitis obliterans is the
most common late complication of HSCT, occurring more than 3 months after
transplant.
IPS is defined as diffuse noninfectious lung injury after transplantation.
Corticosteroid is not beneficial in treatment of IPS. Treatment with
etanercept is associated with a significant improvement in these
patients.
DAH is usually observed within the first month after HSCT, during
periengraftment phase. High dose steroid is the treatment of choice for
DAH, although its efficacy has not been proven in prospective clinical
trials.
Bronchiolitis obliterans occurs in 6% to 26% of allogeneic stem cell
recipient. Patients with bronchiolitis obliterans present with gradually
worsening dyspnea, nonproductive cough, and wheezing. Patients are
usually afebrile. Pulmonary function test shows persistent obstructive
pattern. High resolution CT scan shows evidence of air trapping.
Immunosuppressive agents are the treatments of choice.12
Mucositis

Mucositis is extremely common during the neutropenic period and corresponds
to the painful desquamation of the gastrointestinal epithelium. Almost 100% of
patients will develop some grade of mucositis after the conditioning regimen,
usually starting 3 to 5 days after the preparative regimen and lasting for 7 to 14 days.
The only demonstrated preventive treatment currently available is Palifermin
(keratinocyte growth factor), which is able to reduce the frequency of severe
mucositis from 60% to 20%. It was also associated with significant reduction in the
duration of mucositis, from 9 to 3 days.13 Others measures after mucositis is
established include bland rinses, topical anesthetics, mucosal coating agents, and
topical and systemic analgesics.
Engraftment Syndrome

Engraftment syndrome (ES) is characterized by a combination of noninfectious
fever, erythematous rash, and noncardiogenic pulmonary edema occurring during
neutrophil recovery phase following HSCT. It occurs most frequently after
autologous HSCT. Treatment with a short course of corticosteroid is usually very
effective especially in patients with significant pulmonary involvement.
Infections

560

Patients undergoing HSCT are at very high risk of infection due to the disease
itself, previous chemotherapies, the preparative regimen, mucosal barrier
breakdown, GvHD, and immunosuppressive drugs.
There are three periods of host defense recovery after HSC transplantation, and
particular infections pose a threat in each period (Fig. 31-2).14
The phase I or preengraftment phase, <30 days post
posttransplant, is marked by severe neutropenia and mucosal barrier
damage. As such, the patient is at risk of infection with skin and
gastrointestinal organisms. Gram-negative bacilli, Escherichia coli,
Pseudomonas, Klebsiella, and other enterics may cause local infection or
sepsis. Enterococci or viridans streptococci may also cause bacteremia.
Catheter-related bloodstream infection can be caused by staphylococci,
particularly Staphylococcus epidermidis. Fungi, including Candida species
and Aspergillus, may cause disseminated disease. Viral reactivation with
herpes simplex virus (HSV) is common, as is varicella zoster virus (VZV),
causing shingles. Human herpesvirus 6 commonly reactivates and is
implicated in graft failure. BK virus is associated with encephalitis,
hepatitis, and cystitis. Adenovirus and rotavirus may cause enteritis.
Respiratory pathogens include adenovirus, influenza, parainfluenza, and
respiratory syncytial virus.

recipients. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Guidelines for preventing

Wkly Rep. 2000;49: 1–128. Available at:
http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr4910a1.htm.
Special consideration is given to nosocomial transmission of pathogens,
including drug-resistant organisms. Thus, vigilance for methicillin-resistant
Staphylococcus aureus is necessary, and broad coverage with vancomycin may
be appropriate in the setting of neutropenic fevers without a known focus.
Vancomycin-resistant enterococcus is commonly isolated from the stool but is
often nonpathogenic; however, it requires treatment if isolated from the blood.
Clostridium difficile causing colitis and diarrhea is problematic, as many
patients receive broad antibiotics at some point during transplant. Contact
isolation and strict adherence to routine hand washing are necessary to prevent
outbreaks of nosocomial pathogens.
562

The phase II or postengraftment is from day 30 to 100
posttransplant. It is characterized by intense cellular and humoral
immunodeficiency, the appearance of GvHD, and increased risk of CMV
reactivation.
The phase III or late phase is after day 100 posttransplant. It is
characterized by a T-cell-mediated immunodeficiency and the emergence
of chronic GvHD. Several studies have demonstrated that although
innate immunity recovers within several weeks, B cell and CD8 T cell
counts take several months to normalize, and CD4 T cells can take
several years or, indeed, may never recover in the presence of chronic
GvHD.
Among the most common infections in the later stages after transplantation
is recurrent encapsulated bacterial infection, CMV reactivation, which can
cause interstitial pneumonia and retinal compromise, and VZV reactivation.
Patients are also at risk of Pneumocystis jiroveci (formerly P. carinii) and
Aspergillus sp. pneumonia.14,15
Prevention of Infections

Strict adherence to hand-washing procedures and isolation precautions (visitor
screening, HEPA filtered air, no fresh flowers) is mandatory in the care of the HSC
transplant patient. Avoidance of unwashed fruits, vegetables, unroasted nuts, and
raw food is recommended but its impact on infection prevention is not known. Also,
good oral and body hygiene is recommended. Gut decontamination with antibiotics
is no longer recommended.
Routine prophylaxis includes trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, dapsone, or pentamidine against Pneumocystis; acyclovir or valacyclovir against HSV and VZV; and
fluconazole, itraconazole, or posaconazole against candidemia. Vaccination with
inactivated vaccines can be started >12 months posttransplant, and patients will
require a 23-valent pneumococcal vaccine as well as yearly influenza vaccinations
(resuming 6 months posttransplant. Complete guidelines for preventing opportunistic
infections among hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients can be found at
http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr4910a1.htm.
General Principles of Treatment of Infections

Workup should be directed at the most likely organisms based on time after HSC
transplant. Under the minimal suspicion of infection, rapid labs and imaging, such as
blood and urine cultures, CMV or aspergillus serologies, chest x-ray, and sinus or
chest CTs, should be done. Treatment often requires broad-spectrum antibiotics and
563

antifungals, which should be started as soon as possible and normally without
knowing the causative agent. Acyclovir is used for HSV and VZV at therapeutic
doses. For CMV, ganciclovir or foscarnet is required. Human herpesvirus 6 is
responsive to ganciclovir or foscarnet. Candida albicans and tropicalis are
sensitive to fluconazole but disseminated infection may require echinocandins
(caspofungin, micafungin, or anidulafungin) voriconazole, or amphotericin. Other
Candida species, such as Candida glabrata and Candida krusei, respond to
itraconazole, voriconazole, echinocandins, or amphotericin. For aspergillosis,
amphotericin is the standard; however, voriconazole and caspofungin are very
effective, with fewer side effects. If IV amphotericin is required, lipid formulations
may be used to reduce renal toxicity.
Blood Group Incompatibility

The inheritance of ABO and HLA are unrelated. ABO incompatibility occurs in
30% to 40% of allogeneic HSCT. It can be categorized into 3 subtypes. Major
mismatch is characterized by presence of ABO antibody in recipient plasma against
donor RBC antigens (recipient O, donor A, B, AB or recipient A or B, donor B, A,
or AB). Minor mismatch is defined by presence of ABO antibody in donor plasma
against recipient RBC antigens (recipient A, B, or AB, donor O or recipient AB,
donor A or B). Bidirectional mismatch is the presence of both major and minor
mismatches (donor A, recipient B or vice versa).16
Major mismatch can lead to immediate hemolysis of RBCs in stem cell
products, delayed hemolysis of donor RBCs or pure red cell aplasia
(PRCA). Removal of RBCS from stem cell products can prevent
immediate hemolysis. ABO antibodies are usually undetectable 2 months
after major mismatch HSCT. Prolonged persistence of recipient B cells
and plasma cells leading to persistence of ABO antibodies can occur for
longer than 120 days after transplant. This can lead to delayed
hemolysis or PRCA. Delayed hemolysis can be managed by transfusion of
group O RBCs until anti-donor antibody has disappeared and recipient
blood group has changed to donor blood group. PRCA can be managed
by removal of recipient memory B cell and plasma cells by tapering
immunosuppression permitting “graft versus plasma or B cell” or by using
rituximab.
Minor ABO mismatch can cause “passenger lymphocyte syndrome” that is
attributed to rapid proliferation of lymphocytes transfused with stem
cells. Hemolysis starts between days 3 and 15 posttransplant, lasts 5 to
10 days, and then gradually resolves as the patient incompatible RBCs
564

are destroyed and replaced by transfused group O RBCs and/or donor
RBC derived from engrafted stem cells. Passenger lymphocyte syndrome
can be managed by trans-fusion of group O RBCs and in extreme cases
plasma exchange.
HEMATOPOIETIC STEM CELL TRANSPLANT PROGNOSIS
Over the past decade, there have been substantial advances in the care of
patients undergoing HSCT, resulting in significant improvements in transplant
related mortality, relapse rate, and overall survival.17 Despite significant advances
in the knowledge of the biology and results of HSC transplantation, infections and
other treatment-related complications are still a limiting factor in improving
outcomes. Many complications are emergent and require admission to an ICU.
Respiratory failure due to infections is common and may require mechanical
ventilation. In addition, GvHD, infections and medication toxicities may contribute
to multiple-organ dysfunction syndrome. The mortality rate is high in these
situations, and overall prognosis should be discussed with the patient and family
members promptly. Long-term survivors are at risk of complications such as chronic
GvHD and secondary malignancies and should be closely followed. Factors such as
age, comorbidities, and indication for and type of transplantation all contribute to the
overall prognosis in each individual patient.

INTRODUCTION
Patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are at significantly
increased risk of developing a malignancy compared with the general population.
HIV contributes to the development of cancer through immunosuppression promoting
the tumorigenic effects of coinfecting oncogenic viruses. HIV infection also induces
immune dysregulation causing chronic B-cell stimulation and cytokine activation that
contributes to the initiation of malignancies. AIDS-defining malignancies include
Kaposi sarcoma (KS), primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL), nonHodgkin lymphoma (NHL), and invasive cervical cancer. In addition, patients with
HIV infection are also at increased risk of developing certain non-AIDS-defining
malignancies.1 Introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has
resulted in a significant change in the epidemiological and clinical profile of cancers
in HIV-infected patients by decreasing the mortality associated with opportunistic
infections and by improving the longevity of the patients. Although a significant
decrease has been reported in certain AIDS-defining malignancies, such as KS, in
the developed world, as patients live longer with chronic HIV infection, malignancy
is becoming an important cause of morbidity and mortality.2 Immune reconstitution
following HAART and advances in chemotherapy and supportive care has resulted
in improved outcomes of cancers in HIV infected patients compared to the preHAART era.3

KAPOSI SARCOMA

569

GENERAL PRINCIPLES

Epidemiology

KS is the most common HIV-related malignancy. The incidence of KS is
approximately 15 times greater in men than in women. It is most common in
homosexual or bisexual men. Since the introduction of HAART, the incidence of KS
has declined markedly in HIV-infected patients. The standardized incidence ratio for
KS compared to the general population fell from 22,100 to 3640. However, KS
continues to be a problem of epidemic proportion in the parts of the world where
HIV remains untreated.
Pathophysiology

KS-associated herpes virus, human herpes virus 8 (HHV-8), infection is found in
all forms of KS. HHV-8 infection is transmitted by sexual contact, but it is also
found in the saliva of infected patients. KS lesions are histologically characterized
by neoangiogenesis and proliferating spindle-shaped cells admixed with an
inflammatory infiltrate of lymphocytes, plasma cells, and macrophages. The
malignant spindle-shaped cells are thought to be derived from HHV-8 infected
circulating endothelial precursors. HHV-8 and HIV infection act synergistically to
produce cytokines, growth factors, anti-apoptotic signals, and angiogenic factors,
which stimulate KS spindle cell growth and create an environment necessary to
develop and sustain the tumor.4
DIAGNOSIS

Clinical Presentation

The clinical presentation of KS varies from minimal to fulminant disease. AIDSrelated KS is generally an aggressive cancer resulting in serious morbidity and
mortality. Although no organ is spared from involvement with KS, the most
commonly involved sites are skin, mucous membranes, lymph nodes, gastrointestinal
tract, and lungs.
The cutaneous lesions are typically multifocal, plaque like or papular,
and pinkish to violaceous in color, although they may evolve into nodules
570

and ultimately ulcerate.
Lymph node involvement can cause lymphedema. Internal disease
can present with vague symptoms and can occur in the absence of
mucocutaneous manifestations.
Gastrointestinal involvement can cause abdominal pain or bleeding.
Pulmonary involvement by KS may cause interstitial infiltrates or
hemorrhagic effusions, resulting in cough and/or dyspnea.
Diagnostic Testing

Diagnosis is established by biopsy of lesions; bronchoscopy or
esophagoduodenoscopy may be necessary for internal involvement. Serology for
anti-HHV-8 antibodies is not central to the diagnosis.
TREATMENT

It is important to note that KS is not considered a curable
malignancy. The treatment decisions are based on the presence and
extent of symptomatic and extracutaneous manifestations.
Optimization of HAART therapy is the first line of therapy.
Local therapy is used for bulky lesions or for cosmesis. Therapeutic
options for local treatment include topical alitretinoin, intralesional
chemotherapy with vinblastine, radiation therapy, laser therapy, and
cryotherapy.
Individuals with more advanced or progressive disease are treated with
systemic chemotherapy. First-line chemotherapeutic drugs are
liposomal anthracyclines such as doxorubicin and daunorubicin. Paclitaxel
is a second-line agent. High-dose interferon-alpha therapy can be used
for patients following immune reconstitution, but it is associated with
significant side effects. Targeted therapy including VEGF inhibitors, KIT
and PDGFR inhibitors, and mTOR inhibitors are being investigated in
clinical trials.
PROGNOSIS
The AIDS Clinical Trials Group classifies patients with AIDS-related KS into
good- and poor-risk groups based on tumor burden, CD4 counts, and the presence of
571

systemic illness. However, in the post-HAART era, the CD4 count is less
important.5 Advanced age and associated AIDS-defining illnesses also affect the
outcome of patients with KS.

HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS–RELATED
LYMPHOMAS

GENERAL PRINCIPLES

Epidemiology

HIV-associated lymphomas constitute the second most common type of
malignancy encountered in patients with HIV infection. Systemic NHL is the most
common type, although the greatest increase in risk over the general population
seems to be with primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL).
Approximately 10% HIV patients develop NHL. It appears to be more common in
males than in females. Introduction of HAART significantly decreases the incidence
of a subset of NHL, such as immunoblastic lymphoma and PCNSL.6
Pathophysiology

Various pathogenic mechanisms are attributed to development of lymphoma in
HIV, including HIV-induced immunosuppression, chronic antigenic stimulation,
genetic abnormalities, cytokine dysregulation, dendritic cell impairment, and viral
infections associated with Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) and HHV-8.7

NON-HODGKIN LYMPHOMA

GENERAL PRINCIPLES
HIV-related NHLs are a heterogeneous group of tumors. More than 95% of the
tumors are derived from B cells. Notable differences between HIV-related
lymphoma and NHL in the general population include propensity for advanced
572

disease, presence of B symptoms, extranodal disease including bone marrow
involvement, leptomeningeal disease, and disease in unusual locations.
Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common HIVrelated lymphoma. It is divided into centroblastic and immunoblastic
types. The immunoblastic type is more characteristic of HIV infection and
is more frequently associated with EBV infection (90%) compared to the
centroblastic type (30%). Overexpression of Bcl-6, a proto-oncogene
product, is usually associated with centroblastic and not immunoblastic
DLBCL.
Burkitt lymphoma accounts for 30% of HIV-related lymphoma. Thirty
to forty percent of HIV-related Burkitt lymphomas in Western countries
are associated with EBV infection, and c-MYC activation is involved in all
cases.
PCNSL represents a distinct extranodal presentation of DLBCL in HIV
infection. It is usually of the immunoblastic type and is associated with
severe immunosuppression (CD4 count <50) and universal EBV infection.
Its involvement is usually confined to the craniospinal axis, without any
systemic involvement. Its prognosis is extremely poor.
Primary effusion lymphoma represents <5% of HIV-related
lymphomas. It is associated with HHV-8 infection and frequent
coinfection with EBV. It is an aggressive tumor and morphologically
varies from the immunoblastic to the anaplastic type. It is of B cell origin
but does not express B cell antigens.
Plasmablastic lymphoma is a subtype that typically involves the oral
cavity and jaw. It is highly associated with EBV infection and lacks HHV-8
infection. The tumor consists of large plasmablast cells with the
morphological features of immunoblasts, but the immunophenotypic
features of plasma cells.
DIAGNOSIS

Since many other HIV-associated diseases, including various infections,
can mimic the clinical and imaging features of lymphoma, biopsy is
typically needed for diagnosis. The staging workup includes CT of the
chest, abdomen, and pelvis and bone marrow evaluation. Because CNS
involvement is common, MRI of the brain and lumbar puncture for
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis should be considered for all patients
573

with HIV-related lymphoma.
The workup of a brain mass requires special consideration. CNS imaging
cannot reliably differentiate between CNS lymphoma and toxoplasmosis.
A solitary lesion is more likely to be lymphoma. If brain biopsy is
hazardous, PCR for CSF EBV DNA is 80% sensitive and almost 100%
specific for PCNSL and, hence, could substitute for a diagnostic biopsy.
TREATMENT

With the use of HAART and anticipated immune restoration, standarddose chemotherapy is the standard of care in patients with HIV-related
NHL. Concurrent HAART and chemotherapy regimens CHOP
(cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and prednisone) or CDE
(cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and etoposide), or dose-adjusted
EPOCH (etoposide, prednisone, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, and
vincristine) without highly active antiretroviral therapy (HARRT) have
proven to be effective and tolerable.
If HAART is used with chemotherapy, zidovudine should be avoided due
to an increased risk of myelosuppression. Also, caution should be
exercised with didanosine, stavudine, and zalcitabine, which may
potentiate vincristine-induced neuropathy.
The role of rituximab in AIDS-related lymphoma remains unclear.
Rituximab should not be given to DLBCL patients with CD4 <50 due to
high risk of infection.
Prophylactic intrathecal methotrexate may be delivered at the time of
initial CSF analysis to reduce the risk of leptomeningeal disease,
particularly in patients with Burkitt lymphoma, Burkitt-like lymphoma
histology, bone marrow, paranasal or paraspinal involvement, or EBV
virus coinfection.
PCNSL is treated with high-dose methotrexate chemotherapy and/or
whole-brain irradiation.
Select patients with relapsed or refractory lymphoma can be considered
for high-dose chemotherapy with stem cell support.
PROGNOSIS

574

Poor prognostic factors include low CD4 counts (<100), elevated lactate
dehydrogenase, poor performance status, presence of extranodal disease, prior
AIDS-defining illness, advanced stage, and aggressive histology of lymphoma.

HODGKIN LYMPHOMA
Clinical features of HIV-associated Hodgkin lymphoma include a high frequency
of B symptoms, advanced-stage disease, a higher incidence of bone marrow
involvement, and universal EBV coinfection. Histological subtypes most often seen
are mixed cellularity and lymphocyte depleted. Although chemotherapy outcomes are
improving in the post-HAART era, the prognosis is significantly worse than that for
HIV-negative patients. Timing of HAART therapy again remains inconclusive.
Chemotherapy regimens that have been studied include ABVD (doxorubicin,
bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine), BEACOPP (bleomycin, etoposide,
doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, procarbazine, and prednisone), and the
Stanford V regimen (doxorubicin, vinblastine, mechlorethamine, etoposide,
vincristine, bleomycin, prednisone), and involved field radiation for initial bulky
disease.

CERVICAL CANCER
HIV infection is a strong risk factor for cervical cancer independent of the
usual demographic and behavioral risk factors for cervical cancer. HIVpositive women have significantly increased rates of cervical
intraepithelial neoplasia compared to HIV-negative individuals, and the
incidence of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia increases with the severity
of immunosuppression. However, there has been no convincing evidence
to show increased invasive cervical neoplasm in HIV-infected individuals
compared to HIV-negative women. HIV-positive patients are more likely
to be infected with the oncogenic human papilloma virus (HPV) strains
16, 18, and 31 and, also, with multiple HPV subtypes compared to HIVnegative individuals. HPV infection is more persistent in HIV-positive
patients and correlates with the severity of immunosuppression.8
The Centers for Disease Control recommends two Pap smears at
a 6-month interval for any woman newly diagnosed with HIV. If
both are negative, a Pap smear should be repeated annually.
575

HIV-positive patients with cervical cancer have more intractable disease
and have a higher relapse rate compared to the HIV-negative group.
Restoring immune function with HAART may improve the treatment
outcome.

OTHER CANCERS
In large database studies of linked HIV and cancer registries, several other
cancers have been shown to be increased in incidence compared to that in the
general population: invasive anal carcinoma (an HPV-associated illness), multiple
myeloma, leukemia, lung cancer, and malignancies of the oral cavity, lip, esophagus,
stomach, liver, pancreas, larynx, heart, vulva, vagina, kidney, and soft tissues.
Multiple myeloma in HIV-infected individuals occurs at a younger age and has a
more aggressive clinical picture. The most common epithelial neoplasms seen in the
general population—breast cancer, colon cancer, and prostate cancer—do not
appear to occur more frequently in HIV-infected patients. In contrast to the adult
malignancies, the clinical pathology and optimal therapy of AIDS-related
malignancies in children are unclear.

GENERAL PRINCIPLES

Definition

Cancer of unknown primary (CUP) is defined as biopsy-proven metastatic
cancer where the site of origin of the primary tumor is not identified after
standard evaluation, including a thorough history and physical
examination, imaging studies, laboratory data and detailed pathologic
evaluation.
Cancer of unknown primary includes a heterogeneous group of patients
characterized by an aggressive clinical course and that is less responsive
to chemotherapy. The search for the primary site of cancer has been
increasingly facilitated by the advancement in diagnostic modalities.
Historically, the median survival for this group of patients ranged from 6
to 10 months in clinical trials, however life expectancy has been noted to
be as low as 2 to 3 months in unselected patient populations.1,2 There
are, however specific subgroups of patients with CUP who have
treatment-responsive disease and may be able to achieve long-term
disease-free survival with appropriate management. The workup of a
patient with an unknown primary tumor should focus on identifying the
patients with these treatable conditions. An exhaustive search for the
primary tumor after adds little to the overall management of the patient,
as the primary tumor site is located in <20% of patients before death
and up to 70% of cases remain undiagnosed even after autopsy. 3
Classification

578

Based on the light microscopy findings, they are classified into the below five
major subtypes: moderate to well-differentiated adenocarcinoma (~60% of cases),
poorly differentiated carcinoma with or without features of adenocarcinoma
(~30%), neuroendocrine carcinoma (~1%), poorly differentiated or undifferentiated
malignant neoplasm (~5%), and squamous cell carcinoma (~5%) as outlined in
Table 33-1. The poorly differentiated tumors can include neuroendocrine tumors,
lymphomas, germ cell tumors, melanomas, sarcomas, embryonal malignancies or
may remain unspecified even after complete pathologic evaluation.4,5
Epidemiology

The exact incidence of CUP tumors is unknown, as they are often not reported
accurately in tumor registries. The SEER database and international registries
demonstrates that the estimated incidence from of CUP accounts for ~5% of all
initial cancer diagnoses.4 It is generally a disease of the middle-aged, with the
median age at diagnosis being 60 years and is slightly more frequent in males.1

Etiology

The extreme heterogeneity within this group of patients precludes any specific
identifiable etiologic or associated risk factors that may contribute to its
pathogenesis.
Pathophysiology

CUP is a heterogeneous group of tumors. The molecular basis of this entity has
not been elucidated. They are known to possess a unique set of clinical
characteristics apart from the obvious absence of primary tumor such as: early
dissemination, unpredictable metastatic pattern, aggressive disease and overall poor
579

prognosis. The absence of the primary site of tumor is likely attributed to the slow
growth pattern of the primary tumor or involution of the tumor at its primary site.
DIAGNOSIS
Extensive workup in the evaluation of patient with CUP identifies the primary
tumor ~20% to 30% of patients ante mortem and autopsy studies remains
inconclusive in majority of patients.
Clinical Presentation

A thorough history and physical examination is warranted in every patient with
newly diagnosed cancer of unknown primary. Patients typically present with
symptoms of widely metastatic disease and often have multiple symptoms at
presentation. While pain is the most common presenting symptom, other common
symptoms include weight loss, anorexia, fatigue, new mass, lymphadenopathy,
central nervous system abnormalities, and bone pain or fracture. A careful physical
examination may point towards additional sites of metastatic disease, but these are
often not helpful to identify the site of primary involvement. In a series of 657
patients studied at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, lymph nodes were the most
frequently involved site of metastasis, while other major sites of involvement
included liver, bone, lung, pleura, and brain.6 Cervical adenopathy can be a
manifestation of primary lung, breast, or head and neck cancer, as well as
lymphoma. Lung and pancreatic cancers were most frequently identified in an
autopsy series as the primary tumor site in patients with CUP, followed by other
gastrointestinal and gynecological malignancies.3 It is important to keep in mind that
CUP tumors can metastasize to any site and the pattern of metastasis, while
sometimes suggestive of an underlying primary tumor, does not confirm the
diagnosis.
Diagnostic Testing

Standard diagnostic testing includes chest x-ray, blood chemistries and blood
counts, standard imaging with CT scan and pathologic evaluation of the tumor.
Tumor markers, mammogram, additional imaging studies including PET scan,
testicular ultrasound or breast MRI and endoscopic evaluation depend on the site of
the metastasis and features noted on pathology that are discussed below. The
appropriate workup of an occult primary tumor after baseline evaluation with
standard diagnostic tools includes identification of specific clinicopathologic
580

subsets with favorable prognosis.
Diagnostic pathology. An accurate pathologic evaluation of tumor
specimen is paramount to the diagnostic evaluation of patents with CUP.
An adequate tumor sample is cornerstone to obtaining valuable
information from light microscopy, immunohistochemical staining and
other sophisticated testing including genetic/molecular studies and
electron microscopic evaluation in some cases.
Light microscopy. This technique provides basic information with
regards to the morphology and level of differentiation of the tumor. It
rarely provides information necessary to identify the origin of the
metastasis. Some special staining techniques may help to rule out
sarcomas and lymphomas, however these histochemical techniques have
limited utility and are less sensitive and specific than their
immunohistochemistry counterparts.
Immunohistochemistry (IHC). This technique is widely available and
is often useful in identification of the primary origin of malignancy.
Immunohistochemistry uses a panel of monoclonal and polyclonal
antibodies to various cell components including enzymes, structural
components of cells, hormone receptors, oncofetal antigens and other
substances identified by the immunoperoxidase technique. Important
staining characteristics of some of the common malignancies are shown
in Table 33-2. Among the tumors identified as adenocarcinomas, staining
for the cytokeratin CK7 and CK20 is the most common first step.
CK7+/CK20 – tumors include lung (adenocarcinoma), biliary tract and
pancreas, ovary (nonmucinous), endometrium, thyroid, cervical and
breast cancer, while CK7–/CK20+ tumors include gastrointestinal, ovary
(mucinous) and Merkel cell carcinoma. CK7+/CK20+ tumors include
urothelial, biliary tract and pancreas and ovary (mucinous). CK7–/CK20–
tumors are head and neck, liver, lung (squamous and small cell) prostate
and kidney.
Electron microscopy (EM). EM is not widely available and is
expensive, but it may contribute to the diagnosis in rare cases, especially
in the evaluation of poorly differentiated tumors. For example, secretory
granules can be seen in neuroendocrine tumors, Weibel–Palade bodies in
angiosarcomas, premelanosomes in melanomas and prekeratin filaments
and desmosomes in squamous cell carcinoma. Electron microscopy is
recommended in the evaluation of poorly differentiated neoplasm in
581

young adults when the IHC is inconclusive.
Cytogenetics and molecular diagnostics. Cytogenetic analysis is an
evolving field and may also be useful in certain situations.
Isochromosome 12p and 12q are seen in germ cell tumors, translocation
t(11;22) is seen in Ewing sarcoma and primitive neuroectodermal
tumors, while t(8;14) translocation can be seen in some lymphoid
malignancies, especially Burkitt’s lymphoma. Overexpression of c-myc,
ras, c-erbB2, EGFR and VEFG among others are demonstrated by IHC in
various frequencies in different studies, although the exact role of this
diagnostic evaluation is not completely clear at this time.

582

Gene expression profiling. High throughput molecular profiling
technologies are rapidly accumulating data on expression of multiple
genes in several human tumors. By identifying the pattern of “typical
gene expression profile” for each tumor with the help of these advanced
techniques, it is becoming increasingly possible to molecularly assign a
primary tumor of origin in patients with CUP. The overall accuracy from
12 studies using several tumor samples is in the range of 75% to
85%.7,8 It has to emphasize that while a primary site of the metastatic
tumor can be molecularly assigned, it is not yet clear if these tumors will
have the same biology and response to therapy as their metastatic
counterpart with known primary. The prognostic and predictive value of
this diagnostic tool is presently unclear and needs to be validated in
prospective trials. It is not considered a part of standard workup for CUP
at this time.
Laboratories

In addition to routine evaluation with standard chemistry and blood counts, tumor
markers are additional laboratory testing that may be warranted in certain clinical
situations to identify specific treatable CUPs.
Tumor markers. Some of these clinical situations include β-HCG and
AFP in young men with CUP to identify extra-gonadal germ cell tumors,
PSA in men to identify metastatic prostate cancer, serum thyroglobulin in
rare patients with bone metastasis to identify occult thyroid cancer and
serum CA 15–3 and CA125 can be helpful in women with isolated axillary
lymph node enlargement or peritoneal papillary adenocarcinomatosis.
Routine evaluation of commonly used epithelial tumor markers, such as
CEA, CA19–9, and CA125 are nonspecific and do not provide any
additional diagnostic value in identifying the primary tumor and most
often nonspecific elevation in multiple tumor markers may be noted in
patients with CUP.
Imaging

The importance of CT scan is well established in the workup and staging of
patients with newly diagnosed malignancy. Mammography and/or ultrasound of the
breast are recommended in clinically suspicious cases of breast cancer. MRI of the
breast is a very sensitive test to evaluate clinically occult breast cancers and can be
requested in suspected cases when mammography and ultrasound are not diagnostic.
583

The use of fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET scans done in conjunction with a
noncontrast CT study is used sometimes to provide better anatomic localization.
Small studies suggest that PET/CT may be more sensitive than traditional imaging
studies in locating a primary tumor, but larger follow-up studies have yet to be
reported. For now, clinical judgment governs the use of PET/CT in the workup of
CUP, and clinicians should consider this imaging test if the results would
significantly change further management.
Diagnostic Procedures

Endoscopy. The decision regarding the need for endoscopy is based on
the clinical presentation of the patient with CUP. Upper airway
evaluation by ENT with an endoscope is recommended for patients with
isolated cervical lymph node involvement. Bronchoscopy and
gastrointestinal endoscopies are indicated in patients with pulmonary or
abdominal signs and symptoms respectively. Proctoscopy and/or
colposcopy are recommended for patients presenting with inguinal lymph
node involvement.
TREATMENT
Historically patients with CUP are known to have a poor outcome. The
identification of subset of patients with favorable features who enjoy a longer
disease-free survival is an important step in the management of patients with CUP.
These patients with favorable features have a distinct clinicopathologic
characteristics and their management is outlined separately. For patients with lack of
favorable characteristics, palliative approach with combination chemotherapy is the
cornerstone of management. It is important to establish the goals of care and assess
their candidacy for chemotherapy in patients with unfavorable features. The general
principles of management are shown in Table 33-3 and the paragraphs below
summarize the management based on histology.
Well-differentiated or moderately differentiated
adenocarcinoma. Well-differentiated or moderately differentiated
adenocarcinoma is the most frequent type of CUP, accounting for 60% of
cases. These patients are typically elderly, with multiple sites of
metastasis and their presentation depends on the sites of involvement.
Immunohistochemistry is of limited value in this group of patients,
although identification of ER/PR status or PSA is valuable for treatment
584

and prognosis. Few patients in this group fit into a favorable treatment
subset. Most patients have a poor prognosis and are mainly treated with
palliative intent. Patients with a good performance status should be
considered candidates for systemic therapy and/or clinical trials. Multiple
chemotherapy regimens have been evaluated in these patients with the
aim of stabilizing their disease. The combination chemotherapy regimens
listed under NCCN guidelines based on available data from clinical trials
as is shown in Table 33-4.

585

Poorly differentiated carcinoma with or without features of
adenocarcinoma. This group accounts for about ~30% of CUP cases.
The majority of the patients have a poorly differentiated carcinoma
histology, while a third have some features of adenocarcinoma
differentiation. In comparison to patients with moderately or welldifferentiated adenocarcinoma, these patients tend to be younger, have
more rapidly progressive symptoms, and have peripheral lymph nodes,
and mediastinal or retroperitoneal involvement. Favorable subsets with
specific therapeutic implications have to be excluded from this group of
patients. The prognosis and treatment for the remaining patients with
unfavorable features are similar to the ones with well-differentiated
adenocarcinoma group. Recent clinical trials by investigators at the
Minnie Pearl Cancer Research Network incorporating several newer
agents including targeted therapy have noted further improvement in
outcome.4
586

Squamous cell carcinoma. Squamous cell carcinoma accounts for 5%
of all cases of CUP. Majority of patients in this subgroup fall into specific
clinical syndromes and are largely treatable, hence appropriate
diagnostic workup should be undertaken. Management of patients with
squamous cell carcinoma involving the cervical, supraclavicular and
inguinal lymph nodes are outlined below. Patients with squamous cell
carcinoma involving other areas should be evaluated for occult lung
primary with CT scan and bronchoscopy. Other sites of origin of tumor
include head and neck, esophagus, cervix, anus, rectum, and bladder.
Patients should be evaluated for additional sites when indicated, as
some adenocarcinoma can undergo squamous differentiation and
immunohistochemistry may be helpful in these situations. Table 33-4
outlines the chemotherapy regimens listed under the NCCN guidelines for
squamous cell carcinoma of unknown primary.
Poorly differentiated neoplasm. Poorly differentiated neoplasm
account for ~5% of CUP. Detailed pathologic evaluation is very
important in this subgroup, as treatment may differ radically based on
the results. Many of these tumors can be characterized as atypical
lymphomas, neuroendocrine tumors, or germ cell tumors by careful
pathologic testing. If a specific diagnosis cannot be made, then poorly
differentiated neoplasms are treated the same as poorly differentiated
adenocarcinoma. It is again important to exclude important treatable
clinical scenarios, for example if a male patient aged <50 years old
presents with a poorly differentiated neoplasm (especially with
mediastinal or retroperitoneal mass), particular attention should be paid
to exclude the diagnosis of an atypical germ cell tumor.
Neuroendocrine carcinoma. Neuroendocrine carcinoma of unknown
primary site accounts for a minority of the CUP patients. Some are well
differentiated or low grade with features typical of carcinoid, or islet cell
tumors and have metastatic involvement of the liver or bone. They can
be associated with syndromes such as Zollinger-Ellison and carcinoid
from secretion of bioactive amines. In some of these patients, a primary
site can be found in the small intestine, rectum, pancreas, or bronchus
on further evaluation. These tumors are generally indolent and their
treatment recommendation is per the standard guidelines for metastatic
carcinoid or islet cell malignancies with known primary site. The other
types of neuroendocrine tumors include those with aggressive behavior
587

either with neuroendocrine histology or lack of distinctive neuroendocrine
features on light microscopy. The neuroendocrine features in this later
group are only recognized on detailed pathologic evaluation. treatment
recommendation for small-cell carcinoma of unknown primary is
combination chemotherapy as recommended for small-cell lung cancer.
Patients with poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinoma of unknown
primary site are still a highly treatable subgroup and a trial of
combination chemotherapy with platinum-based regimen is
recommended.
SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
Below are the distinct clinicopathologic entities that require special attention, as
these represent subgroup of patients with specific therapy recommendation and
relatively better outcomes given their treatable and/or curable situations.
Extragonadal germ cell tumor presenting as poorly
differentiated carcinoma/malignancy with midline distribution.
Extragonadal germ cell tumors should be suspected in men aged <50
years old with midline tumors, either mediastinal or retroperitoneal
tumors, and a relatively short duration of symptoms. Tumor markers
(AFP and β-hCG) should be checked and treatment should be formulated.
For example, poor prognosis germ cell tumors are treated with platinumbased regimens. High overall response rates of more than 50% with
15% to 25% complete responses and 10% to 15% long-term diseasefree survival rates have been noted in this subgroup.3
Women with peritoneal carcinomatosis. Women may present with
peritoneal carcinomatosis with histologic features suggestive of ovarian
adenocarcinoma, such as psammoma bodies and papillary structure, in
the absence of primary tumor even after abdominal exploration. Patients
often have elevated CA-125 levels and they rarely metastasize outside of
the peritoneal cavity. These women should be treated as stage III
ovarian cancer with surgical cytoreduction followed by adjuvant
chemotherapy with a platinum based regimen. Approximately 11% to
25% of patients are noted to have long-term survival with this
management.3
Women with adenocarcinoma involving axillary lymph nodes.
Breast cancer should be suspected in this group of patients. Breast exam
588

and mammography should be performed, as well as staining for estrogen
and progesterone receptors and HER2 status. Breast MRI can also be
used if initial studies are unrevealing. In this group of patients with
negative exam and imaging, occult breast primary, usually measuring
less than 2 cm in diameter has been found in 44% to 80% of
mastectomy specimens.4 Patients should be evaluated for other metastatic involvement, and if evaluation is negative, they should be treated
for stage II or III breast cancer. The treatment should include lymph
node clearance with primary breast surgery and/or breast irradiation.
Patients should receive adjuvant systemic treatment based on their age,
lymph node status, ER/PR status, and HER2 status. If patients are found
to have additional metastatic disease, they may have metastatic breast
cancer and may benefit from therapy for metastatic breast cancer.
Men with suspected prostate cancer. All men with metastatic
adenocarcinoma with unknown primary should have their PSA levels
checked. Their tumors can also be stained for PSA. Patients with
elevated PSA should undergo hormonal treatment for prostate cancer
even if the clinical features are atypical, as many will have significant
palliation of their symptoms along with prolonged disease control.
Patients with a single metastatic lesion. On occasion, only one site
of metastatic disease is found even after complete evaluation and they
represent a favorable prognostic group. Treatment should include
aggressive local therapy of the metastatic lesion with surgical resection
or radiation or a combination of both modalities. The role of systemic
treatment is not yet defined in these patients, but can be considered for
patients with good performance status and poor differentiation,
especially in the context of clinical trials.
Squamous cell carcinoma involving cervical and supraclavicular
lymph nodes. Primary head and neck cancer should be suspected in
patients with squamous cell carcinoma involving upper and middle
cervical lymph nodes. These patients are usually elderly with history of
tobacco and alcohol abuse. CT scan to evaluate the head and neck
region is important to define the extent of the disease and identify the
primary site. Careful direct and endoscopic evaluation of these areas is
also indicated to complete the workup. The treatment recommendation
is similar to the loco-regional management for locally advanced head
and neck cancer with radical neck dissection, local radiation or a
589

combined modality approach. About 30% to 40% of these patients
achieve long-term disease free survival with this local therapy.4 Systemic
chemotherapy administered concurrently with radiation or in the
adjuvant setting can also be considered in patients with unknown
primary in a similar fashion as indicated for head and neck cancers with
known primary. In patients with lower cervical and supraclavicular lymph
node involvement, a search for a primary lung tumor has to be
undertaken. Local treatment to the neck is recommended when the
primary site remains unidentified.
Squamous cell carcinoma involving inguinal lymph nodes. In
patients with inguinal lymph node involvement, careful physical
examination of the perineum and anorectal region should be undertaken
to reveal a primary site. Anoscopy in all and pelvic examination in
females should be part of the evaluation. If no primary site is identified,
patients should undergo inguinal lymph node dissection with or without
radiation therapy, especially if extensive disease is identified. Systemic
chemotherapy can be considered in the adjuvant or neoadjuvant setting.
Gestational choriocarcinoma. Metastatic gestational choriocarcinoma
should be suspected in young women with poorly differentiated
carcinoma and pulmonary nodules. A recent history of pregnancy,
spontaneous abortion, or missed menses may be elicited. Imaging of the
abdomen may show enlarged uterus and an elevated β-hCG is often
helpful in making the diagnosis. These patients carry a high cure rate
with single agent methotrexate.
MONITORING/FOLLOW-UP
There are no definite guidelines for monitoring and follow-up given the overall
poor outcomes and short life expectancy in this patient population. Patients who fall
into specific subgroup as mentioned earlier should follow the guidelines similar to
the primary malignancy. While patients receiving palliative chemotherapy should
follow the treatment schedule, the symptomatic patients should receive supportive
management as often as needed.
OUTCOME/PROGNOSIS

590

This is a heterogeneous group with median survival of 6 to 10 months.1 Features
such as lymph node involvement, pathologic diagnosis of carcinoma, squamous
carcinoma, and neuroendocrine carcinoma confer a survival advantage, while male
sex, pathologic diagnosis of adenocarcinoma, increasing number of involved organ
sites and visceral involvement including liver, lung, bone, pleura, or brain are
associated with poor survival. 6 Although the outcome overall is poor, it is worth
mentioning again the importance identifying the patients that belong to the favorable
subgroups who can be cured or treated with very encouraging long-term outcomes.
The decision to treat the rest of patients in the unfavorable subgroup must be
individualized and based on performance status and the patient’s desire to proceed.

GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Supportive care addresses the physical, mental, and spiritual needs of the cancer
patient. Physical symptoms can arise from the cancer itself, the side effects of
therapy, medications, or comorbid medical conditions. This chapter focuses on
symptom control as an important element of oncology practice, including pain
management, nausea and vomiting, mucositis, diarrhea, anorexia, and dyspnea. It
also addresses the emotional issues of depression, anxiety, and delirium, and
presents an approach to addressing spiritual needs of the cancer patient.

MANAGEMENT BY PHYSICAL SYMPTOM PAIN
MANAGEMENT

GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Pain is a prevalent complaint in cancer patients, occurring in 50% to 70% of all
patients with cancer. More than one half of cancer patients experience moderate to
severe pain, and 50% to 80% of cancer patients are not satisfied with their pain
relief. The under treatment of cancer pain can be attributed to multiple barriers,
including physician, patient, and societal factors. A physician must remember that
each person’s pain is different and must be treated as such.1
Definition

593

Pain is always subjective. The International Association for the Study of Pain
defines pain as “an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with
actual or potential tissue damage, or described in terms of such damage. Each
individual learns the application of the word through experiences related to injury
early in life.” Acute pain may be associated with physical signs, including
tachycardia, hypertension, hyperventilation, facial grimacing, and verbalizations.
However, patients with chronic pain may not exhibit any of these overt physical
signs and may not “appear in pain.” It is important to remember that pain is always
subjective, and the patient’s self-reporting is a key element to an accurate pain
assessment.1
DIAGNOSIS

The first step in the management of pain depends on a comprehensive
pain assessment gathered through history, physical exam, and review of
laboratory and radiology studies. Important pain characteristics to elicit
from the patient should be descriptions of the pain with regard to onset,
duration, intensity, quality, and exacerbating or relieving
factors. The physician can use each of these characteristics to identify
potential etiologies and institute the appropriate pain management plan.
Simple tools can reliably aid in the measurement of pain. The most
common clinical assessment tools are verbal rating scales and visual
analog scales. A verbal rating scale uses words to describe pain such as
none, mild, moderate, severe, or excruciating. A visual analog scale uses
a line with or without verbal clues or numbers and asks patients to place
their pain rating on this scale. The specific scale used to measure pain is
less important than the consistent use of a scale over time. For illiterate
or pediatric patients, a visual analog scale can be used with pictures to
describe the levels of pain as a better pain assessment tool.
TREATMENT1–4

The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends the use of an
analgesic ladder in the approach to the selection of opioids to treat
cancer pain. Analgesic selection should be guided by the severity of
594

cancer pain. Patients with mild to moderate pain are usually started on
acetaminophen or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).
Patients with moderate to severe pain, or those who had insufficient
relief after a trial of acetaminophen or NSAIDs, are treated with an
opioid used for moderate pain, such as codeine, hydrocodone,
dihydrocodeine, and oxycodone. This opioid may be combined with
acetaminophen or an NSAID or an alternative adjuvant drug (tricyclic
antidepressant, anticonvulsant, or topical anesthetic). Many of the drugs
used for moderate to severe cancer pain are available in the United
States as a combination of the opioid and acetaminophen or aspirin
(ASA). The drug can be titrated until the maximum safe dose of
acetaminophen (4 g/d) or ASA is reached.
Patients with severe pain, including those who fail to reach adequate
pain relief with drugs from the second step on the WHO ladder should
receive an opioid that is useful in the treatment of severe cancer pain.
The drugs useful in the treatment of severe cancer pain include
morphine, hydromorphone, fentanyl, oxycodone, and methadone. These
opioids may also be combined with acetaminophen or an NSAID or an
adjuvant drug when needed. Patients can experience a variation of
analgesia and side effects between the different opioids. A clinician may
need to rotate among the various opioids to identify the drugs that have
the correct balance between pain control and side effects. These drugs
should be titrated to analgesic effect or intolerable side effects.
There is no maximum dose limitation on the opioid medication itself.
In the treatment of cancer pain, it is important to distinguish
between acute and chronic pain, as the goals of treatment are
slightly different. Acute pain is a linear event; the pain starts, and, with
relief of the offending event, the pain stops. Chronic pain is cyclical in
nature, repeating itself over time. For acute pain, the goal of treatment
is pain relief. To accomplish pain relief, the drugs administered should
have a rapid onset of action, with the desired duration of action (e.g., 2
to 4 hours). These drugs are given as needed. Common side effects,
such as sedation, are usually acceptable and well tolerated by the
patient. An example of an acute pain scenario is the patient who falls
and suffers a hip fracture at the site of a previous bone metastasis. The
patient is treated with short-acting IV narcotics until surgery can be
performed to stabilize the fracture.
595

Chronic pain management has a different focus. The overall goal is
pain prevention and the avoidance of undesirable side effects, such as
sedation. The analgesic regimen should include long-acting narcotics
administered on a regular schedule and should be individualized for the
patient based on side effects. Patients with chronic pain also need to
have the understanding of how to manage acute exacerbations with
short-acting, rapid-onset analgesics, most commonly referred to as
breakthrough pain relief. Many cancer patients have chronic pain.
Chronic pain is ineffectively managed when the clinician focuses on acute
control of the pain in this setting.
Medications 1–4

Opioid therapy can provide effective pain relief to the majority of
patients with cancer pain. Opioids can be classified as pure agonists or
agonist antagonists, based on their interactions with opioid receptors in
the body. The drugs that are included in the agonist–antagonist subclass
include butorphanol (Stadol), nalbuphine (Nubain), pentazocine (Talwin),
and buprenorphine (Buprenex). Drugs in this subclass have a ceiling
effect for analgesia and may reverse the effects of pure agonists. For
these reasons, use of the mixed agonist–antagonist subclass is not
recommended in the treatment of cancer pain.
When managing chronic pain, it is important to remember that there are
wide variations in dose requirements. This variation is not based on the
size or age of the patient or the amount of disease present. The
analgesic dose required to keep a patient out of pain cannot be
predicted, but rather, must be determined by educated trial and error.
The following are guidelines for opioid use in chronic pain patients.
Start with one drug at the lowest effective dose. Titrate the drug
to pain relief or intolerable side effects. If the patient is unable to
tolerate one narcotic due to undesirable side effects, switch to an
alternative agent.
Use around-the-clock dosing schedules to avoid peaks and valleys
in serum analgesic levels.
Sustained or long-acting release preparations of narcotics are very useful
in this population. When converting between modes of administration or
drugs, calculate the equianalgesic dosages to avoid undermedicating a
patient. See Table 34-1.
596

Breakthrough pain medications should be the same or a similar
drug used for long-acting pain relief. The minimum effective
breakthrough pain medication dose should be equivalent to 12.5% of the
patient’s total daily narcotic requirements, or 25% of a single BID dose.
Keep the regimen as simple as possible. Avoid mixing a variety of
analgesic regimens.
Always start a bowel regimen when placing a patient on
narcotics, as constipation is a side effect of all narcotics.
Educate the patient and family about dosing and side effects.
Discuss and reassure the patient and family about addiction, tolerance,
and physical dependence.

Morphine is the drug of choice for moderate to severe cancer pain. It
has a wide range of doses available and flexible methods of delivery.
Morphine is available as sustained-release, immediate-release,
liquid/sublingual, and parenteral preparations. The sustained-release
tablets may be given per rectum or sublingually in patients unable to
swallow. Oxycodone is available orally as immediate- and sustainedrelease preparations. Fentanyl is available in the parenteral route, as
well as the fentanyl (Duragesic) patch for patients unable to swallow or
who cannot tolerate morphine or oxycodone. The patches are applied to
the chest wall or back and changed every 48 to 72 hours. The onset of
action in these long-acting preparations is 12 hours. When starting a
patient on long-acting agents, the clinician needs to provide the patient
with immediate-relief preparations for use in the interim, until the longacting narcotic can achieve adequate serum levels for analgesia.
597

Meperidine (Demerol) should be avoided in the treatment of
chronic pain. Meperidine has the very short half-life of 2 to 3 hours.
This is ineffective in the management of chronic pain. Meperidine has a
toxic metabolite, normeperidine, which is a weaker analgesic but a
potent CNS stimulant. Normeperidine has a half-life of ≥25 to 30 hours in
the setting of renal failure. This can rapidly lead to accumulation of the
drug when used for more than 48 to 72 hours. CNS toxicity can include
irritability, tremors, myoclonus, agitation, and seizures. When CNS
toxicity occurs, it is important to stop the drug. Naloxone (Narcan)
should not be administered, as the effects of normeperidine are not
reversed with naloxone and can precipitate worsening CNS toxicity.
Propoxyphene (Darvon-N) is another narcotic agent that is
ineffective in the treatment of chronic pain. Despite its widespread
use, the drug has no more analgesic properties than ASA (650 mg).
Propoxyphene has the long half-life of 6 to 12 hours. It also has a toxic
metabolite, norpropoxyphene, with a half-life of 30 to 36 hours.
Norpropoxyphene has been associated with pulmonary edema,
cardiotoxicity, and cardiac arrest.
IM injections should be avoided for the management of cancer pain. The
use of IM injections is painful, and absorption is unreliable. The onset of
action can be 30 to 60 minutes, and this is not acceptable in the acute
pain setting. IV or transmucosal (sublingual or rectal) routes are much
more efficacious at getting rapid onset of action in the acute pain
setting.
The perception that the administration of opioid analgesics for chronic
pain management causes addiction is prevalent and is a barrier to
adequate pain control. Confusion about the differences among addiction,
tolerance, and physical dependence is in part responsible.
Addiction is a pattern of drug abuse characterized by drug craving and
overwhelming behaviors that are used to obtain a drug.
Tolerance is a state in which escalating doses of opioids are needed to
achieve pain control as the drug effectiveness reduces over time.
Tolerance occurs with all of the side effects of narcotics, with the
exception of constipation. It is important to educate patients and family
members that tolerance too many of the common side effects, such as
itching or sedation, will develop, and that the drug should not be
abruptly discontinued.
598

Physical dependence is the onset of signs and symptoms of
withdrawal with abrupt discontinuation of the opioid. Abrupt withdrawal
may result in tachycardia, hypertension, diaphoresis, nausea, vomiting,
abdominal pain, psychosis, and hallucinations. This is not the same as
addiction. Physical dependence and addiction are not synonymous. When
stopping chronic opioid medications, the dose should be reduced in
increments of 20% every 2 to 3 days to avoid the risk of withdrawal
symptoms. Finally, it should be remembered that patients experiencing
inadequately controlled pain may engage in what appears to be drugseeking behavior, which is easy to confuse with addiction.
Adjuvant analgesics can be important in the treatment of cancer pain.
Adjuvant analgesics include antidepressants, anticonvulsants,
corticosteroids, and local anesthetics. Within the antidepressants,
tricyclics are the most effective as an adjunctive therapy for neuropathic
pain. Common side effects from the tricyclics include orthostatic
hypotension, sedation, urinary retention, confusion, and sexual
dysfunction. Doses of the tricyclic antidepressants should be started low
and titrated for analgesia. Anticonvulsants are also helpful adjunctive
therapies in the treatment of neuropathic pain syndromes. These drugs
include carbamazepine (Tegretol), phenytoin (Dilantin), gabapentin
(Neurontin), and pregabalin (Lyrica). The usual initiating dose of
gabapentin is 100 mg TID titrated up to a maximum of 3600 mg/d. Side
effects of these drugs can be self-limiting, including sedation, confusion,
and dizziness.
Corticosteroids can be useful in the management of bone metastases,
nerve compression, elevated intracranial pressure, and obstruction of a
hollow viscus. Local anesthetics, such as nerve blocks, lidocaine patches,
and eutectic mixture of local anesthetics (EMLA) cream, can aid in the
treatment of cancer pain. In extreme cases, IV administration of
anesthetics can be used in conjunction with IV or intraspinal narcotics to
allow the clinician to administer lower doses of narcotics and spare the
patient the complications of sedation seen with high doses of narcotics.
Bisphosphonates (pamidronate, zoledronic acid) and calcitonin have
been used to treat pain from bony metastases. Clinical trials have failed
to demonstrate clear evidence for the ability of bisphosphonates to
deliver an analgesic benefit over placebo. Calcitonin provides no benefit
in metastatic bone pain over placebo, but some studies suggest that it
599

may reduce the intensity and frequency ofneuropathicpain.

CONSTIPATION5

GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Most constipation in cancer comes from opioid pain management, but the
differential diagnosis of constipation is broad.
DIAGNOSIS

Before assuming that all constipation is pain medicine related in the
cancer patient, one must remember to consider bowel obstruction, spinal
cord compression, hypercalcemia, hypokalemia, diabetes mellitus,
hypothyroidism, timing of chemotherapy, uremia, etc., as these must be
treated differently. Other possible considerations are different classes of
drugs, such as: antacids, anticholinergics, antidepressants, calcium
channel blockers, cholestyramine, clonidine, diuretics, levodopa, NSAIDs,
psychotropics, and sympathomimetics.
During opioid treatment, constipation should be expected. Prophylactic
measures should always be initiated with the start of opioid therapy.
Constipation occurs with all opioids, and pharmacologic tolerance rarely
develops. Symptoms from constipation may become so severe that
patients may decide to discontinue pain medications. This is preventable
with the use of an aggressive laxative regimen.
TREATMENT5

Dietary interventions are almost never sufficient to prevent constipation.
Combinations of agents are often necessary. Clinicians should also avoid
the use of bulk-forming agents in the absence of a motility agent,
especially in debilitated or anorectic patients. When using these agents,
it should be remembered that stool softeners and bulking agents do little
600

to relieve constipation but may make stools more comfortable to pass.
Their sole use will only lead to constipation with soft stools, and another
agent is necessary for adequate treatment. Also, it should be
remembered that the onset of abdominal pain or nausea in a patient
taking opioids may be due to unrecognized constipation.
Laxatives can be classified into three categories: stimulant, osmotic, and
detergent agents (Table 34-2). Stimulant laxatives irritate the bowel,
leading to increased peristaltic activity. Osmotic laxatives draw water
into the bowel lumen and increase the moisture content of the stool. In
addition, they add to overall stool volume. Detergent laxatives
facilitate the dissolution of fat in water and increase the water content of
stool. Laxatives can be titrated to a maximal therapeutic dose. Clinicians
should try to simplify the bowel regimen, as this will improve patient
compliance. Combinations of stimulant and detergent laxatives such as
docusate/senna (Senokot-S) are ideal for preventing opioid-induced
constipation.
Prokinetic agents such as metoclopramide (Reglan) can increase
peristaltic activity and facilitate stool movement. This agent can be used
in combination with other laxative agents. Lubricant stimulants and
large-volume enemas can also be used but are not recommended for
daily use and prophylaxis of opioid-related constipation. The use of these
agents is effective while titrating other laxatives to ensure that the
patient is having regular bowel movements.

601

Often patients present with constipation from narcotics of the order of
days to weeks in duration. It is important to identify this immediately
and treat it aggressively. One can use enemas or suppositories per
rectum, or oral regimens such as lactulose, 20 g every 2 hours, until the
bowels move. Patients should be instructed to inform their physician if
they do not have a bowel movement within any 48-hour time period
while they are on narcotics to avoid potentially life-threatening
complications.

DIARRHEA5

GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Diarrhea can be defined as stools that are looser than normal and that may be
increased in number over baseline. The definition is based on the frequency, volume,
and consistency of stools. In cancer patients, getting up to go to the bathroom
multiple times day and night can be exhausting. If persistent, diarrhea can lead to
dehydration and electrolyte abnormalities that can lead to the need for a hospital
admission.
DIAGNOSIS
Potential causes of diarrhea in the cancer patient can include infections,
malabsorption, gastrointestinal bleeding, medications, chemotherapy (particularly 5FU), radiation to the abdomen or pelvis, and overflow incontinence. It is important
to remember that herbals such as ginkgo biloba, ginseng, and licorice may also cause
diarrhea.
TREATMENT

Patients should be instructed on the establishment of normal bowel
habits. Any change from the normal baseline should be reported to the
physician to avoid severe dehydration or electrolyte imbalances. Patients
602

should be counseled on the avoidance of foods containing lactose or
other gas-forming foods that can increase abdominal cramping and pain.
Another general approach to diarrhea is to increase the bulk of the stools
with the addition of psyllium, bran, or pectin. However, sometimes bulkforming agents can worsen abdominal cramping and bloating.
For the medical management of transient or mild diarrhea, the use of
attapulgite (Kaopectate) or bismuth salts (Pepto-Bismol) can be useful.
Care should be taken to rule out infection by checking Clostridium
difficile toxin before using antiperistaltic medications in the setting of
recent antibiotic use. Potential infectious workup may include checking
for fecal leukocytes, ova, and parasites and stool culture. For more
persistent and severe diarrhea, agents that slow down peristalsis are
more useful, including the following:
Loperamide (Imodium), 2 to 4 mg PO every 6 hours (maximum, 8
tablets/ day)
Diphenoxylate/atropine (Lomotil), 2.5 to 5 mg PO every 6 hours
(maximum, 8 tablets/day)
Tincture of opium, 0.7 mL PO every 4 hours and titrated as needed
(Belladonna can be added as an antispasmodic agent.)
Octreotide (Dandostatin LAR Depot), 10 to 20 mg IM every 4 weeks
For persistent, severe secretory diarrhea, the patient should be admitted
for parenteral fluid support and the initiation of octreotide.
Octreotide (Sandostatin), 50 to 500 μg SC/IV every 8 to 12 hours.
Begin at 50 μg SC/IV, then titrated up 100 μg per dose every 48 hours to
a maximum of 500 μg SC every 8 hours, with titration based on
response; may also be given as a continuous IV infusion, 10 to 80 μg/h.

NAUSEA AND VOMITING5,6

GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Nausea and vomiting are commonly associated with advanced malignancies as a
direct result of the disease or as side effects of chemotherapy or other medications.
There are multiple potential causes of nausea and vomiting in the cancer patient.
Different etiologies for nausea and vomiting may require different interventions for
603

control of the symptoms.
DIAGNOSIS

The three most common forms of chemotherapy-associated nausea are
acute, which begins within 1 to 2 hours of chemotherapy; delayed,
which occurs 24 hours to 5 days after chemotherapy; and anticipatory,
which is a conditioned response from prior occurrences of chemotherapy.
A thorough assessment of nausea and vomiting is important to gain an
understanding of potential etiologies and to allow for an appropriate
choice of antiemetics. A common mnemonic for potential etiologies is the
“11 M’s of emesis”: metastases, meningeal irritation, movement, mental
(anxiety), medications, mucosal irritation, mechanical obstruction,
motility, metabolic, microbes, and myocardial (ischemia, congestive
heart failure). Identification of the source of nausea and vomiting
dictates treatment.
TREATMENT

For prevention of chemotherapy-associated acute nausea, the
three classes of drugs with the highest efficacy are corticosteroids
(dexamethasone), 5-HT3 receptor antagonists (dolasetron, granisetron,
ondansetron, palonosetron), and the neurokinin-1 (NK1) receptor
antagonist aprepitant (Emend). Treatment recommendations for acute
nausea and vomiting are dependent of the emetogenic potential of the
chemotherapy.
For low-emetogenic therapies, dexamethasone or metoclopramide (a
dopa-mine antagonist) is used. For moderately emetogenic therapies, a
5-HT 3 is combined with dexamethasone.
For highly emetogenic chemotherapies, such as platinum-based
regimens, aprepitant is combined with a 5-HT3 and dexamethasone.
For delayed nausea, either single-agent dexamethasone or
dexamethasone plus metoclopramide is recommended. If the
combination treatment does not work, aprepitant should be considered.
Anticipatory emesis is a conditioned response from prior cycles of
604

chemotherapy. Patients benefit from benzodiazepines and behavioral
therapy (hypnosis, desensitization, relaxation, etc.). The best way to
prevent anticipatory emesis is good control of acute and delayed emesis
in prior cycles of chemotherapy.
Nausea and vomiting from a bowel obstruction can be a challenge
to treat, especially when surgery is not an option. Octreotide has been
shown to effectively inhibit the secretion of fluid into the intestinal lumen
and decrease bloating and abdominal pain, as well as nausea and
vomiting. It may be started by continuous infusion or intermittent SC
injection at a dose of 100 μg every 8 to 12 hours and titrated every 24 to
48 hours for effect.
Dopamine antagonists are one of the most frequently used
antiemetics. These medications have the potential to cause sedation and
extrapyramidal symptoms. Medication options include the following.
Haloperidol(Haldol), PO, IV, SC
Prochlorperazine(Compazine), PO, PR, IV
Droperidol(Inapsine), IV
Promethazine(Phenergan), PO
Perphenazine(Trilafon), PO, IV
Trimethobenzamide(Tigan), PO, PR
Metoclopramide(Reglan), PO, IV
Histamine antagonists may also cause sedation and can have a
beneficial effect in some patients. The antihistamines also have the
added benefit of anticholinergic properties, which can also be beneficial
in patients with dual etiologies of nausea. These drugs include the
following:
Diphenhydramine(Benadryl), PO, IV
Meclizine(Antivert), PO
Hydroxyzine(Atarax), PO, IV
Scopolamine is an anticholinergic agent that is useful in treating
nausea induced by the vestibular apparatus. It can also be used
adjunctively with other antiemetics in empiric therapy. Scopolamine can
be given as an IV or SC scheduled or continuous infusion but is also
conveniently available as a transdermal patch.
Serotonin antagonists have been effective in the treatment of
chemotherapy-associated nausea and vomiting. They are also useful for
refractory nausea but are typically tried when other medications have
605

failed. The medications available are as follows:
Ondansetron(Zofran), PO, IV
Granisetron(Kytril), PO, IV
Dolasetron(Anzemet), PO, IV
Palonosetron(Aloxi), IV
The NK1receptor antagonist aprepitant (Emend) has become first-line
therapy on day 1 for highly emetogenic chemotherapies.
The use of dronabinol (Marinol) and benzodiazepines is beneficial in
some patients, but the mechanism of action remains unclear.
Benzodiazepines (i.e., lorazepam [Ativan] at a 1-mg dose) often are
useful in conjunction with other classes of antiemetics and may have a
synergistic effect.

MUCOSITIS5

GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Mucositis refers to painful inflammation and ulceration of the oral mucosa.
Mucositis can result from chemotherapy or radiation therapy. Chemotherapeutic
agents that are associated commonly with mucositis include bleomycin, cytarabine,
doxorubicin, melphalan, methotrexate, etoposide, and 5-FU. Radiation to the head
and neck may also cause mucositis. Patient factors that can contribute to worsening
symptoms include poor-fitting oral prostheses, periodontal disease, and overall poor
oral hygiene. Patients should undergo repair of ill-fitting prostheses, tooth extraction,
and repair of periodontal disease before the initiation of chemotherapy. In the event
that repair cannot be done before chemotherapy, the physician should make a referral
to an oral surgeon once the patient’s peripheral blood counts have returned to
baseline.
DIAGNOSIS
A mucositis grading system established by the National Cancer Institute allows
the physician to assess mucositis severity in terms of both pain and the patient’s
ability to continue to eat or drink, graded on a scale from 0 to 4. A score of 0 is
606

given when there is no evidence of mucositis. When a patient develops nonpainful
erythema or ulcers, but is able to eat or drink, a score of 1 is given. A score of 2 is
given when there are mildly to moderately painful erythema or ulcers, but the patient
is still able to eat or drink without difficulty. This may require intermittent analgesia.
Severe erythema, painful ulcers that cause interference with eating and drinking
requiring constant analgesia, scores a 3. Finally, a score of 4 is given when the
severity of symptoms requires parenteral analgesia and/or nutritional support.
TREATMENT
A standardized approach to the prevention and treatment of mucositis is essential
to quality care in the oncology patient. The prophylactic measures usually used
include mouth rinses with sodium chloride, sodium bicarbonate, chlorhexidine
(Peridex) or calcium phosphate (Caphosol). Regimens commonly used for the
treatment of mucositis and the associated pain include a local anesthetic such as
lidocaine, magnesium-based antacids (Maalox, Mylanta), diphenhydramine
(Benadryl), and an antifungal such as nystatin (Mycostatin) or Mycelex. These
agents are used either alone or at equal concentrations in a mouthwash. The patient
can use the mouthwash up to five times per day for relief. In the treatment of severe
mucositis, narcotics may need to be used in addition to the agents mentioned earlier.

ANOREXIA AND CACHEXIA7

GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Anorexia and cachexia frequently occur with advanced malignancies and are
characterized by a loss of muscle mass and adipose tissue. The increased catabolism
of cancer and the anorexia that accompanies it result in increased muscle protein
breakdown and lipolysis. These symptoms typically represent progression of
disease and are not reversible with parenteral or enteral nutrition. Anorexia and
cachexia are significant causes of distress to the patient and their family members.
DIAGNOSIS

607

Weight loss of more than 5%, decreased appetite and deceased food intake are
the hallmarks of cancer related anorexia and cachexia. The specific etiologies of
these symptoms are not well understood. The clinician should always assess for
other potential etiologies underlying the loss of appetite and weight such as
dysphagia, odynophagia, infections, and side effects of medications.
TREATMENT
There are several approaches to the general management of anorexia and
cachexia.
Patients should be offered their favorite foods and nutritional
supplements if the patients enjoy them. Any dietary restrictions
should be eliminated. Portion sizes can be reduced, and food should
be made to look appetizing. Foods that have potent odors should be
avoided.
There is a variety of pharmacologic approaches for improving appetite.
Corticosteroids have an appetite-stimulating effect, as well as effects
on the patient’s mood and energy level. Dexamethasone (Decadron) at
doses of ≥4 mg/d is recommended. Dexamethasone is preferred
because of the relative lack of mineralocorticoid effects, but any steroid
will be efficacious such as Prednisone 20 mg/d. Steroids are considered
only for short-term treatment, as they lose their efficacy over days to
weeks. If longer treatment is anticipated, megestrol (Megace) has also
been shown to improve appetite in cancer patients. There is a large
variation in the effective dose of megestrol between individual patients.
One should begin with 200 mg PO every 6 to 8 hours and titrate up to
400 to 800 mg/d or Megace ES, 650 mg PO daily. The cannabinoids,
such as dronabinol (Marinol), have been shown to promote weight gain
in cancer patients.
It should be understood that clinical studies have demonstrated no
impact on overall survival or improvement in quality of life when
anorexia and cachexia are pharmacologically managed. Thus, treatment
of anorexia and weight loss is done primarily because anorexia is
distressing to the patients and their families.

DYSPNEA7
608

GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Dyspnea can be one of the most frightening symptoms to patients and their family
members. Some patients with severe tachypnea will not complain of dyspnea, while
others who are not tachypneic report severe dyspnea. For the majority of patients,
relief of dyspnea can be achieved with simple interventions.
DIAGNOSIS
Respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, and blood gas levels often do not correlate
with the patient’s subjective report. The clinician must accept the patient’s selfreport and try to identify and/or correct the underlying etiology of the symptom. In
patients with known advanced disease, the burden of investigating the etiology of the
dyspnea must be weighed against the limited potential benefit from therapeutic
interventions.
TREATMENT
There are three widely used medical approaches for symptomatic
breathlessness: supplemental oxygen, opioids, and anxiolytics.
A therapeutic trial of supplemental oxygen may be beneficial; it has
been suggested that there is a placebo effect in nonhypoxemic patients.
In addition, the cool air moving across the patient’s face from the
supplemental oxygen can also have a calming effect and help to relieve
the feelings of air hunger. Studies have reported that stimulation of the
trigeminal nerve with oxygen can cause a central inhibitory effect and
relieve dyspnea. A fan in the room can also help achieve this effect.
Opioids can provide relief in dyspnea without any measurable effect on
respiratory rate or blood gas measurements. The precise mechanism by
which opioids exert this effect is not known. In an opioid-naïve patient,
doses lower than those used to achieve analgesia may be effective.
Doses of hydrocodone, 5 mg PO every 4 hours, or codeine, 30 mg PO
every 2 hours, can be beneficial in these patients. Other opioids can be
useful and administered IV for urgent situations or when the PO route is
609

not available. Patients can be maintained on a fixed schedule of opioid
IV every 4 to 6 hours. An additional dose of a short-acting opioid,
equivalent to 25% to 50% of the amount of baseline opioid taken every
4 hours can be used hourly for intermittent periods of worsening
dyspnea. Sublingual morphine can also be helpful in the terminal
dyspneic patient.
Dyspnea may cause severe anxiety. Some patients with dyspnea may
need more effective treatment for their anxiety. Benzodiazepines can
be used in addition to opioids and other nondrug therapies to reduce
dyspnea. The clinician should begin with low doses and titrate for
desired effects. Sublingual lorazepam has been shown to be quite
effective if there is no IV access.

ANEMIA8

GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Anemia in cancer patients may be due to the effects of their underlying
malignancy (particularly when there is bone marrow involvement) and/or treatment.
The basic mechanisms involved are decreased erythropoiesis, impaired iron
metabolism, and decreased survival time for RBCs. In addition, erythropoietin
production may be impaired.
DIAGNOSIS
Diagnosis is made by CBC, with a hemoglobin and hematocrit that are less than
normal.

TREATMENT
Current treatment approaches are aimed at treating the underlying malignancy
and boosting red cell mass. Transfusions offer only transient effects and have side
effects such as transfusion reactions, iron overload, volume overload, and cardiac
congestion. It is recommended that transfusions be administered only to those
610

patients who are suffering from symptoms of anemia with hemoglobin <8 g/dL.
Recombinant erythropoietin has been shown to reduce transfusion requirements and
improve outcomes in terms of quality of life and response to treatment. ESAs have
also been associated with tumor growth and shorter overall survival. Strict
guidelines for the use of ESAs of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) have
been published by the FDA and can be viewed at
http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/PostmarketDrugSafetyInformationforPatientsandProvide
ESAs can now only be prescribed by registered users for cancer patients.

EMOTIONAL SYMPTOM MANAGEMENT9

GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Depression occurs in approximately half of cancer patients, though it is often
under-diagnosed and undertreated. Specific problems facing these patients include
pain, medication side effects, and changes in functional status.
DIAGNOSIS
Typical features of major depression may be present, such as depressed mood
for at least 2 weeks, feelings of guilt or worthlessness, inability to concentrate,
decreased energy, preoccupation with death or suicide, anhedonia, and changes in
eating or sleeping habits. In the cancer patient, one must be aware that drugs such as
prednisone, dexamethasone, procarbazine, vincristine, and vinblastine can also
cause depression like symptoms. Loss of appetite, fatigue, or insomnia may be
secondary to chemotherapy, the cancer itself, or pain, making it difficult to diagnose
depression. Excessive guilt, low self-esteem, the wish to die, and hopelessness are
most diagnostic of depression in the cancer patient. One must be careful to screen for
suicidal ideation, as the incidence of suicide is higher in both men and women with
cancer.
TREATMENT

Depression should be screened for and treated in all cancer patients. In
611

addition to counseling by oncologic psychologists, medications can by
useful in the treatment of depression.
Antidepressants may require up to 6 weeks before symptoms are
alleviated. The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g., citalopram,
20 to 80 mg PO daily), bupropion SR (200 to 400 mg PO daily), and
mirtazapine (usual dosage range, 30 to 45 mg PO daily; mirtazapine has
sedating effects but may aid those with insomnia) are all reasonable
first-line agents. Tricyclic antidepressants have the ability to treat
depression and potentiate the effects of opioids on neuropathic pain.
Imipramine, amitriptyline, and doxepin are started at 25 mg PO at
bedtime, then titrated up 25 to 50 mg every 24 to 48 hours until the
desired effect is achieved.
The psychostimulants methylphenidate, dextroamphetamine, and
modafinil are an alternative for depressed patients with cancer (e.g.,
methylphenidate, 5 mg PO at 9:00 a.m. and noon daily). They begin to
work within a short period of time, provide relief from the sedating
effects of opioids, and give the patient improved energy. Tolerance can
develop to stimulants, and dosages may have to be adjusted over time.

ANXIETY9

DIAGNOSIS
The diagnosis and recognition of anxiety can be challenging. Patients often
complain of physical and somatic manifestations of anxiety. The patient’s subjective
level of distress from fear, isolation, estrangement, or other common stressors is
often the impetus for treatment.
TREATMENT
Anxiety is usually treated with benzodiazepines, neuroleptics, antihistamines, or
nonpharmacologic psychotherapies. Benzodiazepines are first-line therapy for the
treatment of anxiety disorders.
Lorazepam, 0.5 to 2.0 mg PO, IV, or IM, every 3 to 6 hours
612

Alprazolam, 0.25 to 1.0 mg PO, every 6 to 8 hours
Diazepam, 2.5 to 10 mg PO, PR, IM, or IV every 3 to 6 hours
Clonazepam, 1 to 2 mg PO, every 8 to 12 hours
Other anxiolytics include the following.
Haloperidol (0.5 to 5 mg PO, IV, or SC every 2 to 12 hours), if there is
concern about respiratory depression
Thioridazine (10 to 25 mg PO tid), if insomnia and agitation are also
present
Hydroxyzine (25 to 50 mg every 4 to 6 hours PO, IV, or SC), which has
mild anxiolytic, sedative, and analgesic properties
Buspirone (10 mg PO tid), a nonbenzodiazepine anxiolytic that is useful
in patients with chronic anxiety or anxiety related to adjustment
disorders
Nonpharmacologic interventions for anxiety and distress include supportive
psychotherapy and behavioral interventions used alone or in combination,
relaxation, guided imagery, and hypnosis.

DELIRIUM9

GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Delirium is common in advanced cancer and is strongly associated with
mortality. The differential diagnosis for delirium in the cancer patient includes
dehydration, hypo- and hypernatremia, hypocalcemia, uremia, liver failure, drugs
(opiates, radiation, chemotherapeutics, benzodiazepines, tricyclic antidepressants,
etc.), brain metastases, paraneoplastic syndrome, and infection.
DIAGNOSIS
One must identify the underlying cause so that supportive therapies can be given.
Many scales exist for the diagnosis of delirium, including the Mini Mental Status
Exam and Memorial Delirium Assessment Scale, and these should be used to both
diagnose and follow delirium.
TREATMENT
613

If supportive techniques do not work, treatment with neuroleptics or sedative
medications can be tried.
Haloperidol (Haldol), 0.5 to 1 mg every 1 to 2 hours PO, IV, or SC is the
first drug of choice for treatment of delirium and is usually effective for
agitation, paranoia, and fear.
Zyprexa, 5 to 10 mg PO, sublingually, is another possible first-line agent,
as it can be given under the tongue.
Lorazepam, 0.5 to 1.0 mg PO or IV, plus haloperidol (but not lorazepam
alone) can be tried next.
Chlorpromazine can be used if no response to antipsychotics is observed
within 24 to 48 hours, as it is much more sedating.

INSOMNIA7

DIAGNOSIS
Insomnia, or inability to sleep, is often a result of pain, medications, anxiety, or a
mood disorder. Poor sleep can be distressing in the cancer patient, as it can make
pain, anxiety, and delirium worse. Proper sleep hygiene and adequate management
of pain and other symptoms are beneficial.
TREATMENT
Benzodiazepines (e.g., lorazepam, 0.5 to 2 mg PO qhs) or antidepressants with
sedating effects (e.g., trazodone, 50 mg PO qhs, or amitriptyline, 25 to 50 mg PO
qhs) may be used in conjunction with the nonpharmacologic measures. Newer agents
such as Ambien/Ambien CR (5 to 10 mg/6.25 to 12.5 mg PO qpm), Lunesta (2 to 3
mg PO qpm), and Rozerem (8 mg PO qpm) can be tried. One should be careful when
treating insomnia in terminally ill patients, as these can be hypnotic drugs. For some
patients, improved cognition may be achieved by discontinuing the medications
without an effect on insomnia.

ADDRESSING SPIRITUAL CARE10
614

When a person has a malignancy, suffering occurs at many levels.
Religion or spiritual belief can be a source of great strength or
considerable pain to a patient. Some find new faith during a cancer
experience, while others find great turmoil. Spiritual care for the
oncology patient can be either uncomfortable for the physician or, if the
physician is overzealous, uncomfortable for the patient. Many doctors
and nurses are appropriately uneasy when it comes to talking about
religion because they fear they might be imposing their religious beliefs
on others. The role of the physician is to advocate and try to connect a
patient with chaplains, the patient’s own religious community, or
nonreligious groups that might help to provide solace.
The role of the oncologic chaplain can greatly aid in the spiritual
journey of a patient, both as an inpatient and as an outpatient.
Chaplains can help identify patients in spiritual distress and address the
religious or spiritual issues raised by their illness. Those who have never
had strong religious beliefs may not feel an urge to turn to religion, but
as trained listeners, chaplains can help patients identify core beliefs,
recognize coping skills, and, potentially, help patients to find sources of
strength within or beyond themselves.
Chaplains also help families identify spiritual resources to enhance their
coping with the level of distress during a loved one’s illness. Often,
chaplains are privy to information that may not be provided to the
medical professional. This can, with permission, be shared for the benefit
of the patient and improvement of care. Therefore, it is appropriate to
involve chaplaincy in a patient’s care. It is not necessary to ask whether
a patient would like a chaplain, as the patient may feel undue pressure
based on distorted understandings of a professional chaplain’s role. A
trained chaplain showing up at the bedside can lead to positive
outcomes, even if the patient is enabled to say, “No, thank you” to
spiritual care. Chaplains work to help people in crisis find a measure of
control in the midst of what can feel like chaos.

INTRODUCTION

True oncologic emergencies are relatively infrequent. However,
physicians who treat cancer patients are often called on to rule out an
oncologic emergency. To diagnose and appropriately treat an oncologic
emergency, physicians must have a working knowledge of the distinct
presentation, appropriate diagnostic testing, and management of a wide
array of complications that are often unique to cancer patients. These
complications primarily result from pressure or obstruction by spaceoccupying lesions, metabolic abnormalities, or cytopenias.

MALIGNANT PERICARDIAL EFFUSION AND TAMPONADE

GENERAL PRINCIPLES

Malignancy is a frequent cause of pericardial disease including pericardial
effusion, cardiac tamponade, and constrictive pericarditis. An autopsy
series of 3314 patients found that cardiac metastases occur in 10% of
patients dying of cancer.1 However, many of these cases were not
clinically significant. Malignant pericardial disease is generally a
manifestation of an advanced malignancy.
The most common malignancies associated with pericardial involvement
are lung cancer, breast cancer, and lymphoma.
617

Pathophysiology

Breast and lung tumors generally spread locally to cause pericardial
disease. Lymphomas involving the mediastinum can involve the
pericardium, whereas leukemias can infiltrate the myocardium, resulting
in a pericardial effusion. Tumors in the pericardial space can cause
bleeding and create a more rapidly accumulating effusion than in an
exudative or transudative process. Patients with acute promyelocytic
leukemia treated with all-trans retinoic acid can develop a treatmentrelated pericardial effusion.
DIAGNOSIS

Clinical Presentation

Patients with small, slowly expanding effusions may present with subtle
nonspecific complaints such as weakness, fatigue, and dyspnea. If a
large effusion accumulates rapidly, patients can develop cardiac
tamponade and hemodynamic collapse.
On evaluation, patients with tamponade exhibit signs of hypotension,
tachycardia, jugular venous distention, and dulled heart tones. Another
sign indicative of tamponade is pulsus paradoxus. The difference in
systolic pressures at which the Korotkoff sounds are heard between
inspiration and expiration quantifies the pulsus paradoxus, which is
normally no more than 10 mm Hg. Classically, Ewart’s sign (dullness at
the left infrascapular area due to bronchial compression by a large
effusion) may be seen, but it is rarely observed in practice.2
Differential Diagnosis

The differential diagnosis of pericardial disease in a patient with
malignancy also includes nonmalignant causes, such as radiation-induced
effusion, hypothyroidism, autoimmune disorders, infection, drug induced,
uremia, and idiopathic pericardial disease.
Other pathologic entities may present with similar symptoms in the
cancer patient.
Cardiotoxicity leading to congestive heart failure can result from
618

chemo-therapy (such as anthracyclines, mitoxantrone, ifosfamide, and
cyclophosphamide) or biologics (such as the monoclonal antibody
trastuzumab). 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU), a commonly used antimetabolite, is
associated with acute cardiotoxicity that can lead to cardiac arrhythmia,
myocardial ischemia, and, rarely, cardiogenic shock. Radiation therapy
can also cause cardiomyopathy in the absence of pericardial disease
(especially in the setting of mediastinal radiation for non-Hodgkin or
Hodgkin lymphoma and left breast radiation for breast cancer). One
must always consider other causes of cardiovascular emergencies in the
cancer patient, such as coronary artery disease, heart failure, and
infectious endocarditis.
Diagnostic Testing

Patients with suspected pericardial disease should have an immediate chest
radiograph and electrocardiogram (ECG).
On chest x-ray, in the presence of a large effusion, the cardiac
silhouette is enlarged in a globular, symmetric fashion. Chest x-ray may
also reveal signs of pulmonary congestion and/or pleural effusions.
ECG commonly shows sinus tachycardia and may reveal reduced voltage
or, with very large effusions, electrical alternans.
Transthoracic echocardiography is the diagnostic test of choice and
should be ordered emergently whenever the diagnosis of tamponade is
suspected. It will diagnose the effusion and indicate the degree of
hemodynamic compromise. Early signs of tamponade on echo include
right atrial and ventricular collapse.
CT scan is also sensitive for diagnosing an effusion. It can detect as
little as 50 mL of pericardial fluid and, similar to an echocardiogram, can
give an idea of intracardiac masses.
MRI also can provide direct imaging of the pericardium. Both of these
tests can give some clues as to the nature of the fluid (bloody, serous,
chylous), but they rarely provide clinically useful information.
TREATMENT

With severe hemodynamic compromise, emergent pericardiocentesis
by a percutaneous, subxiphoid approach should be performed. Giving a
619

rapid IV fluid bolus and inotropics can be temporizing measures to
support the patient until echocardiographic guidance is available.
Complications with “blind” approach include ventricular perforation,
arrhythmias, and pneumothoraxes, and range from 5% to 20%.
Complications are less likely (about 2%) when echocardiography is used
to delineate the size and location of the fluid with respect to normal
cardiac structures.3
A pericardial drain or a pericardial window may be necessary. To prevent
recurrence, sclerosing agents such as thiotepa are available but are
often less effective and have more risks than placing a surgical
pericardial window. A surgical pericardial window is generally the
definitive treatment for a clinically significant pericardial effusion.
Radiation therapy can be used to manage pericardial effusions secondary
to radiosensitive tumors, such as leukemia and lymphoma. Small
asymptomatic effusions may be observed without therapy.

SUPERIOR VENA CAVA SYNDROME

GENERAL PRINCIPLES

Definition

Superior vena cava syndrome (SVCS) is the result of obstruction of the SVC,
by either external compression or internal thrombosis.
Etiology

Lung cancer (non-small-cell lung cancer followed by small-cell
lung cancer) and lymphoma are the most common causes (~85%),
although SVCS has been reported in breast cancer and other
malignancies of the chest as well. 4 These less common malignancies of
the chest include germ cell tumors, thymoma, and mesothelioma.
Thrombosis of the SVC in patients with central venous catheters is an
increasingly common cause of SVCS. Other nonmalignant causes of SVCS
include granulomatous infections, goiter, aortic aneurysms, and fibrosing
620

mediastinitis.
DIAGNOSIS

Clinical Presentation

Patients typically present with swelling of the neck, face, and upper
extremities. Jugular venous distention, cyanosis, and facial plethora may
also be present.
Shortness of breath, dizziness, and rarely obtundation from cerebral
edema are possible if the onset is rapid. Very rarely, the process causes
laryngeal edema and compromise of the upper airway.
Vocal cord paralysis and Horner syndrome are also possible if neural
structures are invaded. With slowly progressive obstruction, collateral
flow has time to develop, and symptoms related to vascular obstruction
may be subtle.
Diagnostic Testing

Chest radiography may show a widened superior mediastinum and
pleural effusions.
CT scan of the chest with IV contrast is the diagnostic test of choice. CT
findings are notable for reduced or absent opacification of central venous
structures with prominent collateral venous circulation. There is no
advantage of MRI over CT.
A diagnosis of the mass should be attempted before treatment is begun
if the tissue type of tumor is unknown. Sputum cytology, biopsy of lymph
nodes, bronchoscopy, thoracentesis (if a pleural effusion is present),
mediastinoscopy, or thoracotomy can be diagnostic. The workup
generally progresses first through less invasive diagnostic testing (e.g.,
sputum cytology) before more invasive tests are performed (e.g.,
mediastinoscopy).
TREATMENT

Supportive measures including a low-salt diet, head elevation, and
621

oxygen can be temporizing.
Diuretics and corticosteroids (e.g., dexamethasone, 4 mg IV every 6
hours) have traditionally been used for treatment at presentation.
Although corticosteroids are likely only helpful in SVCS caused by
lymphoma, diuretics have not been shown to be helpful at all. If
compression is not life-threatening, then a tissue diagnosis should be
made before beginning treatment.
Radiation therapy is useful for non-small-cell lung carcinoma and other
metastatic solid tumors. 5
Chemotherapy is more useful in small-cell lung cancer and lymphoma
owing to their exquisite chemosensitivity, but small trials suggest that
chemotherapy may be as effective as radiation therapy in treating SVCS
secondary to non-small-cell lung cancer, which is relatively
chemoinsensitive.
SVCS resulting from catheter-related thrombus is treated by
anticoagulation and, in limited cases, fibrinolysis. For emergent cases in
which a prompt response is needed, experienced centers can perform
angioplasty and stent placement. These approaches have largely
replaced open surgical intervention, which is now generally done only
when the surgical resection of the tumor is of benefit.
PROGNOSIS
Multiple studies suggest that patients with SVCS do not have shortened survival
compared to similarly staged patients with the same underlying malignancy and no
history of SVCS.

ACUTE TUMOR LYSIS SYNDROME

GENERAL PRINCIPLES

Acute tumor lysis syndrome (ATLS) represents a myriad of metabolic and
electrolyte abnormalities that results from the release of intracellular
products by rapidly dividing tumor cells prior to therapy or from the lysis
622

of sensitive tumor cells during therapy. ATLS usually occurs in the
setting of therapy of rapidly growing, hematologic malignancies,
classically acute lymphoblastic leukemia and high-grade non-Hodgkin
lymphoma (e.g., Burkitt lymphoma). Rarely, ATLS has been described
after the treatment of solid tumors such as breast cancer. The size of the
tumor, rate of tumor growth, and sensitivity of the tumor cells to
chemotherapy determine the risk of development of ATLS (Table 35-1).

DIAGNOSIS

Clinical Presentation

ATLS is characterized by the following electrolyte derangements:
hyperuricemia, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, and hypocalcemia. These
electrolyte abnormalities place patients at risk for cardiac arrhythmias and seizures.
Acute renal failure and uremia can develop from precipitation of uric acid and
calcium phosphate crystals in the renal tubules(Table 35-2).

623

TREATMENT
The best management of ATLS includes identifying patients at risk for ATLS and
taking preventive measures.
IV hydration should occur 24 to 48 hours before initiation of
chemotherapy (3 L/m 2/d) and during therapy. Consider using IV
furosemide (Lasix) to improve urine flow rate if it is <100mL/m2/d.
Electrolytes including phosphorus, calcium, and magnesium; uric acid;
blood urea nitrogen; and creatinine should be measured three times a
day in patients at risk for ATLS.
Hyperkalemia should be treated with standard therapy: glucose and
insulin (acutely), sodium–potassium exchange resins (Kayexalate), and
IV calcium if ECG changes are noted.
Hyperuricemia can be controlled with allopurinol (maximum 800 mg/d
PO or 600 mg/d IV in adults) and/or rasburicase. Uric acid is relatively
insoluble and can precipitate in renal tubules, causing acute renal failure.
Allopurinol decreases the production of uric acid by inhibiting the
enzyme, xanthine oxidase, which converts xanthine and hypoxanthine to
uric acid. Allopurinol must be dose-reduced in patients with renal failure.
Also, allopurinol inhibits the degradation of 6-mercaptopurine and
624

azathioprine so these drugs must be dose-reduced if the patient is taking
allopurinol. Allopurinol does not decrease the amount of uric acid already
present. Thus, one must initiate allopurinol before chemotherapy
in patients with preexisting hyperuricemia or in those at high
risk for ATLS.
Rasburicase is a recombinant form of the enzyme, urate oxidase, which
is derived from yeast and not found in humans. Urate oxidase breaks
down uric acid to form allantoin. Allantoin is much more soluble in the
urine than uric acid and can thus be renally excreted. Rasburicase is
contraindicated in patients with glucose-6-phosphate
dehydrogenase deficiency, as it can cause hemolysis. Other side
effects of rasburicase include methemoglobinemia, bronchospasm, and
anaphylaxis. The dosing of rasburicase is still not defined, but many
institutions use 0.15 to 0.2 mg/kg for one dose and repeat doses only if
hyperuricemia is still present. 6 Rasburicase has not yet been rigorously
tested in randomized, controlled trials in adults; however, case reports
and pediatric data have demonstrated its efficacy. Rasburicase is now
generally the standard of care for pediatric and adult patients with ATLS,
while allopurinol remains the standard prophylactic therapy.
Alkalinization of the urine to increase uric acid excretion can also be
considered in the treatment of hyperuricemia. However, there is no clear
evidence that it improves outcomes.
IV calcium should not be administered for hypocalcemia unless
the patient is symptomatic or hyperphosphatemia is corrected.
Symptoms of hypocalcemia include muscular (cramps, spasms, and
tetany), cardiac (arrhythmias and hypotension), and neurologic
(confusion or seizures) abnormalities. A positive Chvostek or Trousseau
sign is indicative of symptomatic hypokalemia. With a high serum
phosphate level, IV calcium repletion may result in metastatic
calcification and renal failure.
In the setting of hyperphosphatemia, mild cases may be managed
with PO antacids (phosphate binders), but dialysis may be necessary in
patients with poor renal function or metabolic abnormalities not
corrected by conservative measures.

HYPERCALCEMIA OF MALIGNANCY

625

GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Hypercalcemia is the most common paraneoplastic syndrome, seen in 10% to
20% of patients with cancer. Malignancies of the lung, breast, head/neck, and
kidney, as well as multiple myeloma, are most often associated with hypercalcemia.
7
Etiology

Most commonly, a tumor causes hypercalcemia by producing ectopic
parathormone-related protein (PTHrP), which stimulates osteoclasts to cause bone
resorption as well as causing renal tubular calcium retention. Less commonly, tumor
in bone can have a direct osteolytic activity through local cytokines. Rarely,
lymphomas can produce ectopic activated vitamin D to cause hypercalcemia.
DIAGNOSIS

Clinical Presentation

Presentation is often nonspecific. Common symptoms include fatigue, anorexia,
constipation, polydipsia, polyuria, nausea, vomiting, lethargy, and apathy.
Nephrolithiasis is possible. In severe cases, mental status alterations, seizures, and
coma can be seen. Hypercalcemia can cause renal parenchymal damage and
nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. Hypercalcemia produces a brisk diuresis, and
patients are often severely volume depleted. Most clinicians will remember the
symptoms of hypercalcemia from the mnemonic: “stones, bones, abdominal groans,
and psychic moans.”
Diagnostic Testing

Management includes obtaining an ionized calcium level (or an albumin level to
correct for the hypoalbuminemia that is frequently seen in cancer patients). Serum
intact parathormone (PTH) levels should be checked to rule out primary
hyperparathyroidism. Intact PTH levels are suppressed in the hypercalcemia of
malignancy. There is generally no need to check a PTHrP, as the diagnosis of
malignant hypercalcemia is often made by history alone. Other causes of
626

hypercalcemia such as thiazide diuretics, granulomatous disease, and vitamin D
intoxication can also be ruled out by history alone. A serum phosphate level must
be checked, as hypercalcemia often leads to clinically significant hypophosphatemia.
TREATMENT

The acute treatment of hypercalcemia begins with IV fluids (4 to 8 L).
Normal saline is started at 200 to 500 mL/h and decreased after the
volume deficit is corrected. At least 3 to 4 L should be given in the first
24 hours, and a positive fluid balance of at least 2 L should be achieved.
Further saline diuresis (100 to 200 mL/h) will aid in calcium excretion.
Serum electrolytes, including potassium, phosphate and magnesium,
should be measured every 6 to 12 hours and corrected accordingly. Oral
phosphate repletion is standard if the serum phosphate level is low and
the patient has normal renal function. With IV phosphate repletion, there
is the risk of calcium phosphate precipitation and renal failure. Its use
should be reserved for serious cases of hypophosphatemia managed by
experienced physicians. Furosemide can lead to greater calcium loss
through the urine; however, its use is contraindicated until the
patient is euvolemic, and it is generally not necessary.
Other than IV fluids, the mainstay of the treatment of hypercalcemia is a
bisphosphonate. Two bisphosphonates are FDA approved for the
treatment of hypercalcemia of malignancy: pamidronate (Aredia; 60 to
90 mg IV over 2 hours) and zoledronic acid (Zometa; 4 mg IV over 15
minutes).
Bisphosphonates work by inhibiting bone resorption by osteoclasts.
Side effects include flulike symptoms and fever, as well as renal failure
(rarely). These drugs must be used with extreme caution in patients with
underlying renal insufficiency and generally avoided in patients with
significant renal impairment (creatinine clearance, < 30 mL/min). Also,
the dose of bisphosphonates will often need to be reduced in patients
with renal insufficiency. Rarely, patients treated with bisphosphonates
develop osteonecrosis of the jaw. The onset of action of the
bisphosphonates is at between 2 and 4 days, with the peak effect
generally between day 4 and day 7.
Salmon calcitonin (4 international units/kg) is usually administered
intramuscularly or subcutaneously every 12 hours; doses can be
627

increased up to 6 to 8 IU/kg every 6 hours. Nasal application of calcitonin
is not efficacious for treatment of hypercalcemia. Calcitonin is safe and
relatively nontoxic. It lowers the serum calcium concentration by a
maximum of 1 to 2 mg/dL beginning within 4 to 6 hours. Thus, it is
useful in combination with hydration for the initial management of
severe hypercalcemia. The efficacy of calcitonin is limited to the
first 48 hours, even with repeated doses, indicating the development
of tachyphylaxis, perhaps due to receptor downregulation . Because of
its limited duration of effect, calcitonin is most beneficial in symptomatic
patients with calcium >14 mg/L, when combined with hydration and
bisphosphonates. Calcitonin and hydration provide a rapid reduction in
serum calcium concentration, while a bisphosphonate provides a more
sustained effect.
Glucocorticoids (e.g., prednisone at an initial dose of 0.5 to 1
mg/kg/d) may be effective in hypercalcemia due to some hematologic
malignancies and myeloma. Results may take up to 10 days and side
effects from steroid treatment are common. In addition, dialysis is
effective if other treatments fail. Other drugs that are rarely used (now
mostly in hypercalcemia refractory to bisphosphonates) include
calcitonin, gallium nitrate, and plicamycin (mithramycin). Of course, the
definitive treatment of hypercalcemia is successful treatment of the
underlying malignancy.

SYNDROME OF INAPPROPRIATE ANTIDIURESIS AND
HYPONATREMIA

GENERAL PRINCIPLES
The syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (SIAD) was formerly known as the
syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH). It is now
recognized that antidiuretic hormone (ADH)/vasopressin levels are commonly
suppressed in patients with the syndrome, but affected patients have their
homeostatic set-point for sodium set at a lower level than normal. SIAD is seen most
commonly in small-cell lung cancer but can also be seen in many other malignancies
including tumors of the upper gastrointestinal and genitourinary tract.
628

Etiology

In addition to SIAD directly related to the malignancy, drugs can also cause the
inappropriate release of vasopressin or attenuate its action. Common drugs that can
cause SIAD include morphine, vincristine sulfate, and cyclophosphamide.
Pulmonary and central nervous system disease can also cause SIAD that is not
related to an underlying malignancy.
DIAGNOSIS

Clinical Presentation

Patients with SIAD and hyponatremia may present with complaints of anorexia
and nausea. With rapid and severe decline in serum sodium concentrations, they may
also present with confusion, coma, and seizures. Look for decreased serum
osmolality (< 270 mOsm/L) and urine that is not maximally dilute (>100
mOsm/L). In addition to the previously mentioned findings, the diagnosis of SIAD
requires the absence of a hypervolemic state (manifest by ascites, edema) and
absence of volume contraction, along with normal thyroid, renal, and adrenal
function.
TREATMENT

Acute management includes IV normal saline or, in more severe
cases, 3% sodium chloride (which should typically only be given with the
assistance of someone skilled in its use, such as a nephrologist). Allow
only 1 to 2 mEq/L/h of correction for the first 3 to 4 hours and ≤0.5
mEq/L/h thereafter to avoid demyelination syndromes (use even lower
rates of correction for patients with chronic hyponatremia or
hyponatremia of unknown duration—generally 0.5 to 1 mEq/L/h). To
avoid potentially catastrophic demyelination, the overall rate of
correction is limited to 8 to 10 mEq/L at 24 hours and less than 18 mEq
at 48 hours. 8 Furosemide may add to free water loss when given with
saline. Demeclocycline is an antibiotic that lowers urine osmolality and
can be useful in long-term therapy, but renal toxicity limits its use.
Vasopressin-receptor antagonists are a new option for the
629

treatment of SIAD. The vasopressin receptor antagonists produce a
selective water diuresis without affecting sodium and potassium
excretion. Intravenous conivaptan (which is used in hospitalized
patients) and oral tolvaptan are available and approved for use in
patients with hyponatremia due to SIADH. The utility of tolvaptan
therapy is limited by excessive thirst, prohibitive cost (at least in the
United States), and the potential for overly rapid correction of the
hyponatremia which has led to the necessity for hospitalization for the
initiation of therapy. 9

NEUTROPENIC FEVER

GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Neutropenic fever is one of the most common complications of chemotherapy.
Risk of infection is slightly increased with granulocyte counts <1000/μL, markedly
increased with granulocytes <500/μL, and highest with granulocyte counts <100/μL.
Eighty percent of infections in the neutropenic patient originate from the patient’s
own flora. As many neutropenic patients also have long-term vascular access in
place, these are common sources as well. Likely microbes include both
grampositive (Staphylococcus, Streptococcus) and gram-negative aerobes
(Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa).
Definition

Neutropenic fever is defined as a single temperature >38.3°C (or a temperature
>38.0°C for >1 hour) in patients with an absolute neutrophil count <500/ μL (or
<1000/μL that is expected to decrease to <500/μL).
DIAGNOSIS

Clinical Presentation

Signs of infection, such as exudate, erythema, and warmth, may not be evident
because of the reduced numbers of neutrophils. Pneumonias may only be evident by
630

rales, as an infiltrate on chest x-ray may be lacking. Physical examination should
focus on the skin, ocular fundus, sinuses, CNS, pelvis, and perirectal area.
Diagnostic Testing

Management includes searching for a source of infection by obtaining two sets
of blood cultures, with one set from any indwelling intravascular catheter. Sputum
and urine cultures are indicated, and chest x-ray should also be obtained. If
diarrhea is present, a workup for infectious etiologies is indicated including stool
culture and Clostridium difficile antigen testing. Lumbar puncture is not indicated
unless clinical signs of meningitis are present, as neutropenia does not predispose
to meningitis. In addition, lumbar puncture in the setting of thrombocytopenia can be
dangerous.
TREATMENT

Medications

Antimicrobial therapy. Antimicrobial therapy SHOULD NOT wait
the results of diagnostic tests, as patients can die of gram-negative
sepsis in a matter of hours after their first fever, despite appearing well
at initial presentation.10
Empiric antimicrobial therapy in neutropenic fever
Initial therapy is antipseudomonal beta-lactam ± aminoglycoside. A
single agent such as cefepime (2 g IV every 8 hours in patients with
normal renal function) may be used, depending on local sensitivities.
If the patient is still febrile after 3 days of treatment: add vancomycin (1
g IV every 12 hours in normal renal function or adjusted based on trough
levels).
If the patient is still febrile after 5 to 7 days, antifungal coverage should
be added. Caspofungin, Micafiungin, voriconazole, and posaconazole are
reasonable choices, depending on the clinical circumstances. Treatment
with amphotericin B is usually limited to refractory infections or critically
ill patients who have not responded to the above agents.
The above are only general guidelines. If the patient is penicillin allergic,
consider substituting a fourth-generation fluoroquinolone or aztreonam.
If contra-indications to aminoglycosides are present, substitute a
631

fluoroquinolone or aztreonam. One should consider using vancomycin or
linezolid as initial therapy in addition to the previously mentioned
antibiotics if the patient is hypotensive, has severe mucositis, is
colonized with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, recent
quinolone prophylaxis or has signs of obvious catheter infection.
Antibacterial choice may vary depending on organisms and resistance
patterns at particular hospitals or communities. Always consider other
causes of fever in the febrile neutropenic, such as thrombosis.
Antimicrobials should be continued until the neutrophil count rises above
500/mm3 for 2 days and the patient has been afebrile without evidence
of infection for the same duration.
The role of colony-stimulating factors in neutropenic fever is
controversial, but administration should be considered in critically ill
patients.
Other Non-Pharmacologic Therapies

Other precautions, such as visitor screening, hand washing, and proper
isolation measures, should be maintained during this period.

EPIDURAL SPINAL CORD COMPRESSION

GENERAL PRINCIPLES

Epidural spinal cord compression (ESCC), occurring in 5% of cancer patients,
is one of the most common oncologic emergencies. The dural sac is compressed by
tumor in the epidural space at the level of the spinal cord or cauda equine;
neurologic deficits may result. If ESCC is caught early, when pain is the only
symptom, the patient can be spared significant disability.
Etiology

Any malignancy can produce epidural compression, with lung, breast, and
prostate cancers being the most common, followed by lymphoma, myeloma, and
sarcoma. The thoracic spine is the most common location, followed by the
lumbosacral and then the cervical spine. Osteolytic lesions of the vertebral column
632

cause most cases. Compression occurs either by direct extension from metastases in
the vertebral bone or by tumor growth through the intervertebral foramina. On
occasion, tumor can metastasize directly to the epidural space.
DIAGNOSIS

Clinical Presentation

Back pain is the first symptom in 90% of patients. The pain localizes in
the back, near the midline, and is frequently accompanied by referred or
radicular pain. The pain, unlike the pain of a herniated disc, may be
exacerbated by recumbency and improved by the upright position. Many
patients are unaware that back pain is related to their underlying
malignancy and do not seek treatment.
Weakness and sensory impairment may follow from hours to months
after the onset of pain. Regardless of the spinal compression site,
weakness tends to begin in the proximal legs. The weakness can
progress to paraplegia and occasionally develops abruptly without prior
clinical signs. At presentation, about 80% of patients complain of
weakness, usually affecting gait. About 50% of patients have sensory
complaints at presentation. These complaints range from paresthesias to
loss of sensation.
Autonomic dysfunction, including impotence and bowel/bladder
dysfunction, occurs late and is generally not the sole presenting
symptom.
Diagnostic Testing

Whole-spine MRI is the diagnostic test of choice for ESCC. The
entire spine should be imaged because of the high incidence of
asymptomatic multilevel disease.
CT myelography is necessary for patients with contraindications for
MRI. In published studies, CT myelography is as accurate as MRI, but
MRI is noninvasive, safer, and better tolerated. One must also consider
other causes of spinal cord dysfunction, such as myelopathy,
intramedullary metastases, hematoma, and abscess.
Lumbar puncture to search for additional causes should not be performed
633

until spinal cord compression is excluded.
TREATMENT

Dexamethasone is the indicated medical treatment of nearly all
patients with ESCC. Treatment should begin immediately after the
diagnosis is suspected and not be delayed until the results of imaging
studies are available. The dose is controversial, but a common regimen
is a 10-mg IV bolus followed by 4 mg IV every 6 hours (although this
regimen is not supported by published evidence).
Next, all patients should have an immediate neurosurgical
consultation. Patchell and colleagues (2005) published a pivotal
randomized study showing that initial operative treatment benefits a
subgroup of patients with ESCC. 11 The general indications for surgery
include spinal instability with bony compression, neurologic progression
during or after radiation therapy, unknown primary site with surgical
decompression and biopsy, and a single site of cord compression. The
exclusion criteria of the published study were patients with paraplegia
for >48 hours prior to study entry, multiple compressive lesions,
preexisting neurologic conditions including brain metastases, and
radiosensitive tumors (lymphoma, leukemia, multiple myeloma, and
germ cell tumors).
Radiation therapy is also indicated in nearly all patients with ESCC,
either in lieu of surgery or after surgery. The most common regimen is
10 uninterrupted fractions of 3 Gy each.

OTHER NEUROLOGIC EMERGENCIES
Increased intracerebral pressure and cerebral herniation (from
brain metastases, hemorrhage, venous sinus thrombosis, meningitis,
head trauma, infarction, or abscess). Again, immediate consultation with
neurosurgery is often essential. The patient should be stabilized, and
maneuvers to lower intracranial pressures such as hyperventilation and
IV mannitol and/or dexamethasone should be attempted. A head CT
scan can aid in determining whether surgery is indicated.
Status epilepticus (from brain metastases, metabolic derangement, or
634

neurotoxicity of cancer therapy). Ensuring an airway should be the first
and foremost concern. Laboratory studies such as glucose, electrolytes,
Ca, Mg, serum and urine toxicology screens, serum alcohol level, CBC,
urinalysis, and any pertinent medication levels must be obtained. IV
benzodiazepines, phenytoin, and barbiturates are used in the treatment
of status epilepticus. If the patient does not have IV access,
benzodiazepines are also available in rectal, IM, or intranasal
formulations.
Intracerebral hemorrhage (from metastatic tumor,
thrombocytopenia, or leukostasis). Headache, vomiting, and mental
status changes are symptoms of significantly increased intracranial
pressure and hemorrhage. Workup should include imaging with a STAT
noncontrast head CT scan and possibly a lumbar puncture (if CT is
nondiagnostic). Therapy largely focuses on maintenance of adequate
blood pressure, supportive care, correction of coagulopathy and
thrombocytopenia, and surgical consultation when appropriate.

PATHOLOGIC FRACTURES

GENERAL PRINCIPLES

Pathologic fractures are defined as fractures occurring in diseased bone.
Breast, prostate, kidney, and lung are the most common carcinomas to
metastasize to bone and potentially cause fracture. The majority of
patients have multiple metastatic lesions.
DIAGNOSIS

Clinical Presentation

Symptoms include new-onset bone pain in patients with a history of a primary
carcinoma.
TREATMENT
635

In the management of the pathologic fracture, consider life expectancy,
as most fractures are best treated surgically with internal fixation.
IV narcotics and fracture immobilization are used to control pain and
bleeding. Consultation with orthopedics is necessary. Hip and femur
fractures will require traction, whereas casts or splints may be used for
distal fractures. Radiographs of the region in at least two planes are
needed. A bone scan may be obtained to locate occult lesions.
Radiographs of involved bones may identify other areas of impending
fracture. Both the pathologic fracture and impending fractures could thus
be repaired during one surgery.
Bisphosphonates have an expanding role in the prevention of further
pathologic fracture, and treatment with pamidronate or zoledronic acid
should be considered in patients with pathologic fracture.
Consultation with radiation oncology is indicated to determine
whether the patient could benefit from radiation therapy as well.

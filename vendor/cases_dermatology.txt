PREFACE
Dermatology is a broad and hugely enthralling specialty, where a clinician can actually
visualize disease patterns up close – ‘in the flesh’. In many ways dermatology is the art
of the ‘old-fashioned physician’ who relies on careful history-taking and a thorough
examination to make the majority of diagnoses. For the non-specialist, dermatological
‘spot’ diagnoses made through pattern-recognition alone can be challenging; therefore,
this book strives to offer ‘classic’ presentations of common skin disorders through the
fundamental tools of medicine – namely, a detailed history and observed clinical signs.
Part of the fascination with dermatological disorders is the ability of a physician to diagnose systemic disease through the observation of changes in the skin. Consequently, the
accurate recognition of skin disorders is pertinent to all physicians in whatever field of
medicine/surgery they are practising. Therefore, the cases selected in this book mainly
reflect the interface between internal medicine and dermatology. It is often said that
a picture is worth a thousand words; therefore, we hope that the clinical photographs
accompanying each case will speak for themselves in many more words than we would
ever be permitted to write.

CASE 1:

AN ITCHY, SLOW-GROWING INFANT

History
A 26-week-old baby boy attends your clinic with his mother. He has developed a generalized dry, red, itchy rash over the past seven weeks. His mother has been applying a
regular emollient diligently and using a bath emollient. She reports that he is waking
more and more frequently at night and appears to be troubled by his skin. She is worried
about weaning him. He is currently breast-fed and his mother has an unrestricted diet.
He has been offered a bottle of formula milk, but took only 60 mL before vomiting and
developing a rash. He also developed a rash when his father kissed him, immediately after
eating an egg mayonnaise sandwich.
He is the first baby of his parents; his mother had asthma in childhood and his father is
allergic to shellfish. There are no pets at home. His father is a smoker. The baby was born
at term by normal vaginal delivery and is vaccinated to date.

Examination
His height has reached a plateau over the past eight weeks and now rests on the 9th
centile for his age. He is alert and happy, although he rubs his legs vigorously when
undressed. He has generally dry skin, with widespread low-grade erythema and raised,
poorly defined patches of active eczema; there are widespread excoriations (Fig. 1.1) and
no clinical evidence of impetiginization. He has low-grade generalized shotty lymphadenopathy. The rest of his examination is normal.

Questions
• What is this eruption?
• What associated condition does he present with?
• What dietary recommendations will
you make for the baby (and mother)?

Figure 1.1
1

ANSWER 1
This eruption is eczema. The history his mother gives makes an associated food allergy
probable – likely to egg and cow’s milk protein (CMP). This, in combination with a positive family history of food allergy and asthma, means we can classify his skin condition
as atopic eczema. His mother is correct to be anxious about weaning him.
It would be appropriate for this baby to be investigated for associated food allergy. Food
allergy is more likely in babies presenting with eczema from a young age, and it is possible that food allergy may be contributing to the activity of his eczema and vice versa.
The first line investigation should be skin prick test (SPT) to the common weaning food
protein allergens (CMP, egg, soya, wheat, and fish). Peanut is commonly added to this
initial panel.
The history suggests that this baby is likely to be allergic to egg and CMP, and this
has been confirmed by SPT. It would be worth restricting his mother’s intake of these
proteins if she intends to continue breast-feeding as this may improve eczema control.
If his mother wishes to stop breast-feeding, the most appropriate alternative at his age
would be an amino acid formula. The incidence of coexisting CMP and soya allergy is
high and the positive SPT would suggest this baby is currently allergic to both. CMP and
egg are nutritionally important and ensuring a balanced diet while restricting both can
be challenging; specialist dietetic advice is important. Low-grade exposure to allergenic
proteins through maternal milk might be contributing to skin signs and his static growth
parameters.
Regular use of topical emollients and avoidance of detergents are essential for maintaining the skin barrier function of infants with eczema. It is unlikely, however, that
emollients and dietary restriction alone will suffice in the management of his eczema.
His parents should be introduced to the practical aspects of topical therapy and a ‘stepup, step-down’ approach to the management of flares. They should be taught to identify
flares early and initiate effective therapy quickly.
The association of early-onset eczema and egg allergy is associated with a three-fold
increased risk of asthma in later childhood. This is an important opportunity to discuss the
potential contribution paternal smoking would have on increasing that risk. Reassuringly,
both egg and CMP allergy are frequently outgrown, although peanut allergy is more likely
to persist.
KEY POINTS

• Atopic eczema frequently presents within the first year of life and early onset is associated
with risk of associated food allergy.

• Eczema before the age of 1 year and egg allergy are associated with an increased risk of
developing asthma.

• Appropriate allergy testing and dietary advice will help prevent unsupervised dietary
manipulation by well-meaning but misguided parents and may help improve eczema
control.

CASE 2:

AN AGITATED ATOPIC CHILD

History
A 5-year-old girl who is well known to your practice attends with her mother. She has been
troubled by worsening pruritus over the last six weeks. She has missed more than ten days of
school in the last month. Her mother reports that she wakes frequently at night and is lethargic and moody during the day. Her bed sheets are covered in flecks of blood in the morning.
The girl is known to be allergic to egg, fish and peanut, and has begun to develop the
symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinoconjunctivitis within the last couple of months. She has
a positive family history of atopy, both parents are allergic to animals and her older brother
has asthma. Her younger brother has been sent home from nursery with impetigo recently.
Her treatments include an emollient as soap and leave-on preparation and various
strengths of topical steroids ranging from very mild to moderately potent depending on
site and eczema severity. On questioning, however, mother
reports that her daughter’s skin is so sore that she is refusing
to bathe or apply her topical treatment.

Examination
A full examination reveals a fractious child; she is unable to
stop scratching her skin once undressed. She is slim, with her
height at the 25th centile and weight at the 4th centile for
her age. She has widespread, mildly tender, shotty lymphadenopathy (cervical, axillary and groin). Her skin is generally
mildly erythrodermic and extensively excoriated, particularly
her limbs (Fig. 2.1), neck and lower back. The excoriations
are covered with haemorrhagic crust and yellowish exudates.

Questions
• What is the primary diagnosis?
• What secondary complications are exacerbating her pruritus?
• How would you manage this patient?
3

ANSWER 2
The primary diagnosis is atopic eczema associated with a positive family history of atopy
as well as manifestations of IgE-mediated (immediate-type) hypersensitivity (food allergy
and allergic rhinoconjunctivitis). This is clearly a moderate to severe flare of her eczema.
The severity of eczema can be ‘scored’ by various validated subjective (e.g. CDLQI – children’s dermatology life quality index) and objective scoring systems. Crudely, however,
the impact on sleep and school attendance as well as the clinical severity of her eczema
demonstrated in the photograph denotes severe eczema with significant functional
disruption.
There may be several factors contributing to the current flare. It is likely that there is an
element of secondary infection with Staphylococcus aureus or impetiginization of this
child’s eczema. The extensive yellow crusting of her excoriations, her tender lymphadenopathy, and the fact that her brother has impetigo, suggest colonization of the patient
and potentially other family members. Difficulty in adhering to a bathing regime is likely
to contribute. Other potential factors which worsen pruritus include iron deficiency. She
is also vitamin D deficient, presumably due to her dietary restriction (egg and fish are the
main dietary sources of vitamin D).
It is important to gain control of this child’s eczema rapidly. Swabs should be taken for
microbiology culture and sensitivity testing both from the patient and her immediate
family members. As there appear to be at least two members of the family affected by
Staphylococcus aureus it would be worthwhile considering Staphylococcus eradication
protocol for the entire family (i.e. antiseptic washes and antibacterial nasal ointment).
The patient might benefit from a 5–10-day course of antibiotic with good Staphylococcus
aureus coverage (first line: flucloxacillin; second line: erythromycin or co-amoxiclav).
The extensive use of a moderately potent topical corticosteroid ointment for 2–4 weeks
may be required before weaning back to weak preparations or calcineurin inhibitors as
maintenance therapy.
KEY POINTS

• Atopic eczema is by definition eczema associated with a personal and/or family history
of atopy.

• Staphylococcus aureus may cause severe flare of eczema.
• Management of such a flare includes Staphylococcus aureus eradication as well as
appropriate treatment of the eczema.

CASE 3:

AN ACUTE MONOMORPHIC ERUPTION IN A
SYSTEMICALLY UNWELL ATOPIC CHILD

History
A 6-year-old boy is brought to the accident and emergency department by his parents
with a 5-day history of worsening eczema associated with malaise and lethargy. In addition to worsening pruritus and sleeplessness he complains of painful skin, particularly
around his face, neck, chest and forearms. He quantifies the level of pain as 8 out of 10.
His current flare is not responding to diligent application of his usual eczema treatments
according to his ‘step-up’ management plan.
The onset of his eczema was at the age of 4 months, and although moderately severe
in infancy it has been reasonably controlled since starting primary school, with regular
use of emollients and mild to moderately potent topical steroids. His background history includes egg allergy (now partially outgrown in that he tolerates well cooked egg in
cakes) and asthma, currently stable. He has never been admitted to hospital before. He
is fully vaccinated to date and had chickenpox at the age of 4 years. His father suffers
from hay-fever and experienced childhood eczema and asthma. He has one older sister
(aged 14) who is well.
His medication includes:
• Regular emollients both as leave-on preparations and soap substitute
• Topical tacrolimus 0.1% twice daily applied to affected areas for the management of
flares
• Hydroxyzine 10 mg nocte during flares and salbutamol inhaler on a prn basis

Examination
He looks unwell and is febrile at 38.5 °C. Systemic examination is normal except for
widespread lymphadenopathy. There is no evidence of conjunctival erythema and his
vision is normal. He has generalized moderate to severe eczema with erythema, dryness,
excoriation and lichenification. He has a superimposed monomorphic eruption over his
lower face, chest and forearms. The eruption is composed of multiple 23-mm monomorphic ‘punched-out’ erythematous lesions in various stages of evolution (Fig. 3.1). Some of
the lesions are vesicular, others pustular, some coalescing, most are eroded and covered
with a golden exudate and others haemorrhagic crust.
Questions
• What are these lesions?
• How would you confirm the diagnosis?
• What complications can be associated
with them?
• What is their management?

Figure 3.1
5

ANSWER 3
These are typical lesions of herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection complicating atopic
eczema. This eruption is called eczema herpeticum, or less commonly Kaposi’s varicelliform eruption.
Diagnosis can be confirmed by viral swab of a blister or eroded area. Many tests can
detect HSV within tissue or blister fluid. HSV can be inferred by positive staining or
electron microscopy or specifically identified as types HSV-1 or HSV-2 by immunofluorescence, culture, or polymerase chain reaction. Bacteriology swab for microscopy and
culture should also be undertaken.
Significant morbidity is associated with eczema herpeticum. The main potential complications include superimposed bacterial infection (Staphylococcus or Streptococcus)
with risk of systemic sepsis, ocular involvement (in particular, HSV keratitis) and, rarely,
systemic HSV infection with risk of spread to the liver, the lungs, the brain, the gastrointestinal tract and even the adrenal glands. In addition pain and discomfort associated
with eczema herpeticum is significant.
The management of widespread eczema herpeticum includes systemic treatment of HSV
infection with aciclovir, identification and treatment of any superimposed bacterial
infection or strategies to prevent superimposed infection, such as antibacterial washes
and creams. Topical tacrolimus should be discontinued in this patient as this may exacerbate the cutaneous spread of HSV. These cases are usually managed as in-patients,
initially with intravenous aciclovir – as oral preparations can be poorly absorbed.
Ophthamological review should be sought in cases of diffuse facial herpes simplex infection or where conjunctival/corneal involvement is suspected.
In a minority of cases recurrences can occur. Rapid treatment of incipient lesions with
topical aciclovir may help prevent disseminated eczema herpeticum.
KEY POINTS

• Herpes simplex infection in patients with eczema can lead to widespread lesions and an
associated risk of superimposed bacterial infection and sepsis.

• It is important to consider and exclude the rare associated complication of herpes
keratitis.

• In-patient management with systemic anti-viral therapy, topical antiseptic measures,
pain relief, and where indicated antibiotic therapy, is required.

CASE 4:

A RECURRENT, UNSIGHTLY FACIAL ERUPTION IN A
STRESSED BUT WELL YOUNG ADULT

History
A 29-year-old man attends your clinic with a 4-year history of a recurrent and itchy
facial eruption that he feels is unsightly. He notices the eruption is worse in the winter
and tends to improve over the summer. He is currently studying for business exams and
feels the associated stress has triggered the current flare. He avoids soaps, which make his
face sore, and recently has reduced his alcohol intake in an effort to improve his eruption.
He is otherwise well and on no medication.
Examination
A full examination is unremarkable except for the skin of his face, neck, central chest and
scalp. There are poorly defined erythematous patches with overlying adherent greasy scale
affecting his naso-labial folds and extending onto his cheeks (Fig. 4.1). His eyebrows,
scalp, nape of his neck and central chest are similarly affected.
Questions
• What is this eruption?
• What age groups are affected?
• How would you manage this patient?

Figure 4.1

7

ANSWER 4
This eruption is seborrhoeic dermatitis. It is more common among men and typically
affects the sebum-rich areas of the face, scalp and chest. The pathophysiology of seborrhoeic dermatitis is incompletely understood, however. It is linked with Malassezia yeast,
complement activation and abnormalities of T-cell immunity. It may worsen in individuals infected with HIV or affected by Parkinson’s disease.
The condition usually begins around puberty with a peak of incidence between 25 and
40 years of age. An infantile form of seborrhoeic dermatitis may manifest as cradle cap
(Fig. 4.2), facial greasy scaly dermatitis, napkin dermatitis and, rarely, as an erythroderma.
In predisposed individuals seborrhoeic dermatitis usually recurs. Treatment is aimed,
therefore, at reducing morbidity and preventing flares. Treatment aims are two-fold:
reducing the yeast burden as a secondary preventative measure, and switching off the
resultant secondary dermatitis when it occurs. Although topical corticosteroids may
improve appearances of the dermatitis in the short term, they are thought to hasten recurrences and may foster dependence due to a ‘rebound effect’ and are usually discouraged.
The use of a ketoconazole shampoo, with frequent washing and prolonged lathering often
improves associated dandruff and may improve the facial involvement by depletion of
Malassezia. Use of ketoconazole shampoo as a face wash can be irritating, but if tolerated may improve erythema and scaling. Ketoconazole or miconazole cream, calcineurin
inhibitors in combination with antiseptic emollient washes are recommended. For severe
or refractory seborrhoeic dermatitis systemic itraconazole as a short course or ‘pulsed’
(one week per month) is highly effective at reducing the yeast burden.

KEY POINTS

• Seborrhoeic dermatitis is characterized by poorly defined erythematous patches with
overlying greasy, yellowish-brown scale localized to the sebum-rich areas.

• It occurs most commonly among men from adolescence to middle age. Infantile
seborrhoeic eczema can also occur.

• HIV infection and Parkinson’s disease are both associated with refractory seborrhoeic
dermatitis.

CASE 5:

BLISTERED HANDS AND FEET IN AN ATHLETIC MAN

History
A 27-year-old man attends your clinic with a 3-day history of a severe burning itch over
his hands associated with localized blistering and similar although less severe changes
on his feet. He is otherwise well, although he did suffer from asthma is childhood and
occasionally still experiences hay fever. He is on no medication. He works as a graphic
designer and his hobbies include cycling and football, he has no exposure to allergens or
irritants. He is unaware of any triggering factor.
Examination
He has diffuse vesicles, coalescing to form tense bullae over the palmar aspects of both
hands extending into the interdigital spaces (Fig. 5.1) and onto the dorsa of his fingers
and hand. In addition he has erythema, maceration, fissuring and peeling between the
4th and 5th toes on the left side and bilateral but asymmetrical (left worse than right)
purulent vesicles over the insteps.

Figure 5.1

Questions
• What is the diagnosis?
• What investigations would you perform?
• What treatments would you initiate?

9

ANSWER 5
The diagnosis is pompholyx or dyshidrotic eczema, the symmetrical and diffuse clear vesicles over the palmar aspect of the hands associated with pruritus are highly suggestive
and the diagnosis is based on clinical features. Other differential diagnoses to consider
include contact dermatitis (irritant or allergic), friction blisters (e.g. epidermolysis bullosa
simplex), herpes simplex infection, and palmoplantar pustular psoriasis.
Atopy appears to be a predisposing factor for pompholyx. There are several potential
triggers of pompholyx including stress and as an ‘id reaction’ to a distant dermatophyte
infection. In this case the features of interdigital maceration associated with inflammatory pustules and vesicles on the instep are suggestive of inflammatory tinea pedis.
Investigations should include scrapings from the feet (interdigital spaces and affected
areas over the plantar aspects) and hands for mycological tests (direct microscopy and
culture). In this case, scrapings from the feet demonstrated hyphae and spores on direct
microscopy with subsequent culture confirming the presence of the zoophilic organism
Trichophyton mentagrophytes var. mentagrophytes. There was no fungal infection of the
hands.
Treatment of a pompholyx ‘id reaction’ involves treatment of the tinea pedis as well as
treatment of the pompholyx itself. Inflammatory tinea pedis is usually managed with systemic antifungal therapy (itraconzole, terbinafine or fluconazole). Infected scales can be
present on clothing or within footwear, so frequent laundering is recommended. Draining
the larger bullae with a sterile needle will reduce the discomfort. Compresses or soaks
with dilute potassium permanganate help to dry the vesicles and prevent secondary bacterial infection. Potent or superpotent topical corticosteroids are the mainstay of therapy.
In the short term a combination preparation of topical corticosteroids and antibacterial
agent is useful. Occasionally, systemic steroids are required.
KEY POINTS

• Pompholyx occurs as a manifestation of hand eczema, irritant or allergic dermatitis and
as an ‘id reaction’ to a distant dermatophyte infection.

• The mainstay of treatment is the prevention of secondary infection and use of potent or
superpotent topical corticosteroids as well as identification and eradication of the trigger.

CASE 6:

CHRONIC ERYTHEMATOUS PRURITIC ERUPTION ON
THE LOWER LEGS

History
A 67-year-old woman presents to the vascular surgeons with varicose veins. She had a
history of venous ulceration in the past, which has now healed and she is being considered for bilateral varicose vein surgery. At the consultation she complained of a 3-month
history of skin itching and redness, particularly on the right lower leg, and was noted to
have unilateral erythema and was referred to dermatology for an opinion.
Examination
This patient has obvious dilated and tortuous veins on both lower legs. Confluent background dull erythema is seen on the right lower leg, with small inflammatory superficial
erythematous erosions and excoriations (Fig. 6.1). Palpation revealed warm, dry, rough
skin at the affected site.
INVESTIGATIONS
Vascular studies
Resting pressure right: 174 mmHg, left: 180 mmHg, brachial: 167 mmHg
Resting ankle/brachial pressure index right: 1.042, left: 1.078. Bilateral triphasic pulsatile
waveforms
Venous studies showed bilateral saphenofemoral reflux.

Questions
• What is the diagnosis?
• What treatment would you recommend
for her right leg prior to vein surgery?
• Is this patient suitable for compression
hosiery based on the vascular studies?

Figure 6.1

11

ANSWER 6
This patient has chronic cutaneous changes seen on the right lower leg consistent with
the diagnosis of varicose eczema. This common cutaneous eruption usually has an insidious onset over many weeks to months in patients with a background of venous incompetence. The affected skin is pruritic and dry with marked erythema which may be variable
in intensity depending on its chronicity. In the context of venous insufficiency, pitting
oedema may develop owing to poor venous return leaving the skin tight and oedematous. This results in reduced blood flow to the skin, leading to active dusky erythema and
resultant erosions or even ulceration.
Varicose eczema can be readily distinguished from cellulitis affecting the lower leg.
Varicose eczema usually develops slowly, is frequently bilateral, pruritus is marked, the
skin surface is rough and dry, and there are associated varicose veins. Frequently there is
a background brown discolouration of the affected skin area due to haemosiderin deposition. Haemosiderin pigment is derived from haemoglobin, which is left behind in the skin
when red blood cells extravasate into the tissue.
Management of the skin requires a combination of topical therapy and if possible compression. The leg should be washed with aqueous cream or an antiseptic emollient such
as Dermol 500®. A moderately potent topical steroid should be applied to the eczematous
areas and a rich bland emollient. Compression hosiery or two to four layer bandaging is
essential to ‘squeeze’ the fluid out of the legs and allow skin healing. If the ankle/brachial
pressure index (APBI) is above 0.8 then the arteries are sufficiently patent to permit
compression without compromising the arterial blood supply to the lower extremities.
KEY POINTS

• Varicose eczema can be distinguished from cellulitis by slow onset, pruritus and surface
xerosis.

• Management of the eczema will not succeed without addressing the underlying
oedema.

• Potent topical steroids should be applied to the active eczema areas plus emollients and
compression.

CASE 7:

AN ITCHY LOCALIZED ERUPTION

History
A 59-year-old bus driver presents with a 5-month history of a persistent itchy patch
below his umbilicus. Initially it began as an intermittent eruption, coming and going in
an apparently random pattern; over the past six weeks, since the weather became warmer,
it has persisted. He is otherwise well with no history of previous skin problems. He is not
on medication.
Examination
There is a localized area of marked lichenification, post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation, excoriation and erosion at the midline below his umbilicus (Fig. 7.1). The surrounding skin has a more diffuse area of low-grade lichenification, hyperpigmentation and
mild erythema.

Figure 7.1

Questions
• What could this eruption be?
• How should he be investigated?
• What information does this man need?

13

ANSWER 7
These lesions are best described as chronic and eczematous. Such a localized problem
suggests an exogenous aetiology (the photograph that is Fig. 7.1 provides a clue). The
most likely diagnosis is allergic contact dermatitis (ACD), although it can be very difficult to differentiate clinically between ACD and irritant contact dermatitis. Occasionally,
psoriasis may present with a single plaque, particularly at a site of trauma (Koebner’s
effect); however, it is rarely as pruritic as this eruption. Atopic dermatitis is usually
a more generalized and diffuse eruption; however discoid or nummular eczema is
characterized by fairly well defined, coin-shaped, intensely pruritic inflamed areas of
lichenified skin. An inflammatory tinea corporis particularly associated with a zoophilic
organism might also be considered. The presentation of contact dermatitis can be varied,
including dyspigmentation, pustular lesions, urticaria, atrophy, phototoxic reactions and
eczema.
It would be appropriate to obtain a skin scraping for mycology investigations. Patch
testing (Fig. 7.2) is the diagnostic test to detect sensitization to contact allergens.
(Although patch testing is not required for diagnosis; nickel allergy is one of the
few types of allergic contact dermatitis where the history of exposure along with
the signs and symptoms are quite distinctive.) In fact many patients do not present
to medical practitioners as they may well work out the association themselves. If a
patch test series confirms the presence of nickel allergy, its relevance to the current
eruption should be confirmed. A dimethylglyoxime (DMG) test is a simple, inexpensive way to determine whether the object in question contains nickel by a pink colour
change. Chromate, palladium and cobalt are commonly found together with nickel and
concomitant allergy may coexist.
Nickel is a leading cause of allergic contact dermatitis and is responsible for more cases
than all other metals combined. Certain occupations with high exposure to nickel, such
as cashiers, hairdressers, metal workers, domestic cleaners, food handlers, bar workers, and painters, are also at risk for acquiring nickel dermatitis. Patients with atopic
eczema are also at increased risk. Sweating may increase the severity of the dermatitis. Sodium chloride in the sweat causes corrosion of the metal and increases nickel
exposure.
The management of this case includes removal of the offending nickel-containing belt
buckle or trouser rivet and application of topical corticosteroid creams until the eruption has resolved. The patient also requires information about his allergy, that is he will
always remain allergic to nickel and to both the common and unexpected sources of
nickel. Nickel allergy is commonly associated with earrings and jewellery or other body
piercing. Nickel can be found in many everyday items – from coins to necklace clasps,
from watchbands to eyeglass frames, and tools and utensils used in the workplace and
home.

Patch testing (Fig. 7.2)

Figure 7.2 This shows an example
of patch testing in a different patient.
The erythematous areas over the
upper back demonstrate positive
eczematous reactions at day 5 of
patch testing.
Day 1

Detailed history: Questions focus on exposures at home and
work. Understand work environment. Better or worse on
holidays? List of all personal care products. Hobbies and
past-times.
Choice of patch test series: The European Standard Battery
(25 most common contact allergens) will identify ~80% of contact
allergens. Commonly specific extended series performed
according to likely exposure (e.g. healthcare series)
Application of patch tests: Allergens applied within Finn
chambers directly to upper back. Secured with adhesive tape.

Day 3 (after 48 h)

First reading: Patient returns. Inspect patches (ensure adequate
adhesion). Mark individual sites. Score any positive reactions
(/, 1 to 3 or irritant)

Day 5 (after 72 h)

Second reading: Score any positive reactions (as above). Interpret
the results. Review exposure and product constituents. Patient
information: once identified, patients are provided with written
information sheets about any allergens to which they reacted.

KEY POINTS

• Nickel is the most common allergen detected in patch test clinics worldwide. It is a
•
•

strong silver-coloured metal that is commonly used in buckles, utensils and coins.
It should no longer be present in jewellery purchased within the European Union.
A useful test to confirm whether a particular item contains nickel is the
dimethylglyoxime (DMG) test.
The management includes treatment of the manifestation and avoidance of direct
cutaneous contact with nickel.

CASE 8:

AN ECZEMATOUS ERUPTION COMPLICATING VENOUS
ULCERS

History
You are asked to review a 72-year-old retired hairdresser, who attends the leg-ulcer
clinic because of a 4-week history of progressive worsening pruritus of her right lower
leg. Prior to this she had a venous ulcer over the medial malleolus of her right leg, which
has gradually healed over a 4-month period with the diligent application of three-layer
compression bandaging by her local nursing team. Her treatment regime includes a wash
with chlorhexidine containing emollient lotion, application of paraffin emollient to the
entire lower leg, followed by betamethasone–neomycin ointment applied directly to areas
of stasis eczema and easy-release gauze over the ulcerated area. The three-layer bandages
are changed twice weekly. Skin swabs have been taken over the past couple of weeks
because of the worsening skin rash.
She is otherwise well. Her only oral medication is bendroflumethiazide 2.5 mg daily for
hypertension.

Examination
Physical examination reveals a large but localized area of intense erythema and skin
swelling confined to the anterior, posterior and medial aspect of her right lower leg
(Fig. 8.1). There is marked exudate with suggestion of surface vesiculation. No involvement of her skin above her knee or foot is apparent. Although her skin is sore and itchy
there is no swelling or tenderness of her calf. She has no palpable lymphadenopathy.
The rest of her examination including peripheral arterial examination was normal.

Questions
• What is likely to have caused the acute deterioration?
• How would you investigate this patient?
• What advice will you give the patient?

17

ANSWER 8
With acute erythema and swelling of the leg one of the most important differential
diagnoses to consider would be a deep venous thrombosis (DVT). However DVTs are not
associated with the significant degree of epidermal change seen in this case, particularly
in the absence of any other suggestive features (such as swelling or intramuscular tenderness). The negative skin swab does not rule out cellulitis; the morphology and distribution
of the eruption would, however, be atypical and the absence of raised white cell count or
inflammatory markers effectively rules it out.
The clinical features in this case are highly suggestive of dermatitis (stasis, irritant or
allergic contact dermatitis). The extensive involvement and vesiculation would be unusual for stasis dermatitis, which is usually confined to the ‘gaiter’ area, particularly above
the medial malleolus.
The most appropriate investigation would be patch testing. Individuals with stasis dermatitis and stasis ulcers are at high risk for developing allergic contact dermatitis to topical
medications applied to inflamed or ulcerated skin. Patients may also develop allergies to
constituents of the bandages and dressings applied. The chronicity of this condition and the
frequent occlusion of applied medications in these patients contribute to the high risk of
allergic contact dermatitis to preservatives in medications and/or to the active ingredients
in topical medications. Although neomycin penetrates intact skin poorly, it is an important
cause of allergic contact dermatitis when applied to patients with venous stasis/ulceration. It
is used surprisingly frequently despite the lack of documentation of its efficacy in the treatment of stasis ulcers. (Its poor penetration may explain the fact that a positive patch test
reaction to neomycin may be delayed for four days or later following initial application.)
Individuals may develop widespread dermatitis from topical medications applied to leg
ulcers or from cross-reacting systemic medications administered intravenously. Neomycin
is also commonly found in combination preparations with other antibacterials and corticosteroids. These prescription and non-prescription preparations are used to treat a variety of
skin, eye and external ear disorders that have become infected and inflamed. Neomycin is
also present as a preservative in some vaccine preparations. It should be assumed that individuals allergic to neomycin are allergic to chemically related aminoglycoside antibiotics
(e.g. gentamicin, tobramycin) and these agents should be avoided (topically or systemically).

• Individuals may develop allergy to preservatives in medications and/or to the active
ingredients in topical medications, especially neomycin and topical corticosteroids.

CASE 9:

A TRANSIENT PRURITIC ERUPTION EXACERBATED BY HEAT

History
A 26-year-old woman attends the dermatology clinic complaining of a 4-month history of
an itchy eruption. She describes the eruption as ‘cloud-like’. She previously suffered from
eczema as a child but this rash is different. She tells you that although the eruption waxes
and wanes, with individual lesions lasting 8 to 12 hours, she is rarely clear of lesions for
more than half a day. Sometimes she goes to bed with the eruption and wakes clear, but
the opposite can also occur. She has never experienced angioedema. She tells you it is often
worse peri-menstrually. You question her about possible precipitants; she tells you that the
eruption is worse with exercise or a hot bath, but does not appear to be aggravated by pressure or cold. The eruption is partially attenuated by cetirizine 10 mg daily, which she is taking for her hayfever. Her only other medication is occasional ibuprofen for dysmenorrhoea.
There is no family history of skin lesions. Both of her parents are well, although her
mother has a diagnosis of osteoporosis and is on thyroxine replacement. On close questioning she admits that although circumstances at work are stable and have not changed
for a longtime she is experiencing difficulty coping and frequently cries at work.

Examination
On examination there are several scattered lesions over her trunk, limbs and face. They are
composed of well-defined erythematous oedematous plaques surrounded by a pale ‘flare’
(Fig. 9.1). The lesions vary in size and shape but not in morphology. You are unable to
elicit dermographism. The lesion that you ringed initially had disappeared by the time she
presented to photography 2 hours later, with new lesions developing over adjacent skin.
Following their resolution the lesions leave no
persistent skin change. Although the eruption is
pruritic there is no evidence of lichenification or
excoriations. Her blood pressure is 105/68 mmHg
and pulse rate 102 beats/min. Examination of
her cardiorespiratory system is otherwise normal.
Her abdomen is soft and non-tender. You notice
a degree of bilateral upper eyelid lag. She has
a smoothly enlarged goitre and stretching her
hands out she has a fine tremor.
Examination of the remainder of the neurological system is normal. Urinalysis was negative for
blood, white cells and glucose. You ask the patient
to put on her coat and walk briskly up and down
the corridor outside. After five minutes she returns
with a marked aggravation of her eruption, which
is now widespread and generalized over her
trunk and proximal limbs. You draw around a
well-defined skin lesion and request some further
investigations.

Questions
• What is this eruption?
• What factors in the history and on examination might be contributing to the eruption?
• How would you investigate this patient?
• What is the management?

20

ANSWER 9
This patient is suffering from urticaria, which is characterized by wheals or ‘hives’ that
represent areas of cutaneous mast cell degranulation, releasing histamine and other
mediators, followed by transient oedema and erythema. When urticaria persists for more
than 6 weeks it is classified as chronic urticaria. It represents a tissue reaction pattern and
can be precipitated by a variety of stimuli or triggers. Many skin eruptions are known
which may present with ‘urticated’ lesions that are not transient.
There may be more than one precipitant of urticaria in any one affected individual.
Although there is an element of physical provocation, which you have demonstrated by
exercising the patient, the eruption can be present on waking and therefore there is more
to this than cholinergic urticaria. The patient is atopic, a factor reported to be associated with urticaria. She has made an interesting observation that her urticaria is worse
peri-menstrually; the phenomenon of progesterone-provoked urticaria is described. It
is more likely, however, that the exacerbation is due to her use of a non-steroidal antiinflammatory drug (ibuprofen). Importantly, she has clinical features of thyrotoxicosis –
chronic urticaria is associated with a number of autoimmune diseases, particularly
autoimmune thyroid disease (Graves’ disease), systemic lupus erythmatosus (SLE) and
cryoglobulinaemia.
Urticarial vasculitis is an important differential diagnosis of chronic urticaria. Typically
the lesions of urticarial vasculitis are associated with a burning pain and persist for more
than 24 hours. They may leave post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation or ecchymoses on
resolution and can be diagnosed by the demonstration of a leucocytoclastic vasculitis on
biopsy of affected skin. Where urticarial vasculitis is suspected a work-up for potential
systemic vasculitis is important.
The initial investigation of this patient would include complete blood cell count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, thyroid function tests, antithyroid antibodies (antithyroid
microsomal and peroxidase antibodies), basophil histamine release assay. Other tests
which might be considered: skin biopsy, antinuclear antibodies (ANA), C3, C4 (if features
of urticarial vasculitis or associated angioedema suggesting acquired C1 esterase deficiency secondary to SLE), cryoglobulins and cryoprecipitans (if history of cold-induced
urticaria).
It is clear that this patient has symptomatic thyrotoxicosis, so its management and
control may significantly improve or even resolve her urticaria. In the short term propranolol may be indicated until carbimazole achieves a euthyroid state. For any persisting
urticaria non-sedating antihistamines (anti-H1) are the mainstay of treatment. Response
to different antihistamines can vary so it may be worthwhile trialling different agents,
and in some cases doses higher than those required in allergic rhinoconjunctivitis may
be needed. The addition of anti-H2 antihistamine such as ranitidine or cimetidine may
provide some additional blockade of histamine receptors and can be beneficial, as can the
addition of a leukotriene receptor antagonist such as montelukast. In general these agents
are well tolerated. For patients with evidence of autoimmune association and troublesome persistent urticaria, immunosuppressive therapy with agents such as ciclosporin or
methotrexate may be required.

21

!

Causes of chronic urticaria

• Medication: Aspirin, other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, opioids, ACE
inhibitors, radiological contrast media.

• Physical urticaria: The most common causes of urticaria frequently coexist:
• Dermatographism/dermographism – firm stroking
• Delayed pressure urticaria – pressure (6–24 h after the application of pressure)
• Cold urticaria – the cold
• Aquagenic urticaria – water exposure
• Cholinergic urticaria – heat, exercise or stress
• Solar urticaria – sun exposure
• Vibratory urticaria – vibration
• Autoimmune disease: Autoimmune thyroid disease, systemic lupus erythematosus,
•

•
•

•

•
•

cryoglobulinaemia.
Autoimmune urticaria: Immunoglobulin G autoantibodies to alpha subunit of
the Fc receptor of the immunoglobulin E (IgE) molecule (35–40 per cent) or, less
commonly, anti-IgE autoantibodies (5–10 per cent), can activate basophils to release
histamine, the basis of an in-vitro basophil histamine release assay. Autoimmune
urticaria is closely associated with positive anti-thyroid antibodies.
Viral infections are the most common cause of chronic urticaria in children.
Foods and food additives: Some patients report the exacerbation of urticaria
associated with the consumption of certain foods, such as spiced food,
strawberries, tinned or preserved food, or certain baked goods. Some of these
foods contain natural salicylates or other chemical capable of histamine release.
This reaction is distinct from IgE-mediated type I hypersensitivity to foods, which
can be associated with acute urticaria.
Contactants: The onset of localized (or even generalized) urticaria within 30 to
60 minutes of contact with an inciting agent such as latex (especially in health care
workers), plants, animals (e.g. caterpillars, dander), medications, and food (e.g. fish,
garlic, onions, tomato).
Autoinflammatory syndromes: There are rare causes of urticaria such as Muckle–
Wells syndrome (amyloidosis, nerve deafness, and urticaria) and Schnitzler’s
syndrome (fever, joint/bone pain, monoclonal gammopathy, and urticaria).
Idiopathic urticaria is the descriptive term for chronic urticaria for which no
precipitant can be identified.

KEY POINTS

• Urticaria is a cutaneous reaction pattern characterized by the degranulation of mast
cells and transient wheals.

• There are a number of potential precipitants, exacerbating factors and underlying causes
of chronic urticaria.

• The mainstay of therapy is to correct any underlying medical disorders and the use of
non-sedating anti-H1 antihistamines.

CASE 10:

A TODDLER WITH BROWN PATCHES WHICH URTICATE

History
A 16-month-old boy presents to the dermatology clinic. His mother has noticed a gradual
accumulation of ‘brown spots’ on his skin. These lesions were not present at birth and the
majority appeared as a crop over a 4-month period around his first birthday. She feels it
is possible that he will continue to acquire new lesions. He had one on his right forearm
which has resolved. She has noticed that some of the lesions appear to ‘blister’ or become
raised after a bath. He is otherwise well; he is thriving and enjoys a full diet. He has no
gastrointestinal symptoms or wheeze. There is no family history of similar skin lesions.
The rest of the family is entirely well.
Examination
His height and weight are on the 75th and 91st centiles for his age, respectively. He is cooperative and follows directions. He has diffuse, scattered, monomorphic, small oval-round
reddish-brown macules concentrated predominantly over his anterior and posterior trunk,
but also extending to his neck and with a few scattered lesions on his limbs. There are more
than 40 of these lesions. One lesion just below his xiphisternum, when rubbed, became transiently erythematous and swollen (urticaria), a positive Darier’s sign (Fig. 10.1). Examination
of his cardiorespiratory system and abdomen is normal. He has no lymphadenopathy.

23

ANSWER 10
These lesions represent multiple mastocytomas and the eruption is referred to as urticaria pigmentosa. Darier’s sign describes the development of a wheal and surrounding
erythema in a lesion after rubbing (physical degranulation of histamine from mast cells).
Mastocytosis is the abnormal accumulation of mast cells within the skin and rarely other
organs (liver, spleen or lymph nodes). The differential diagnosis would include lentigines
or melanocytic naevi (if Darier’s sign negative) or xanthogranuloma, histiocytosis X or
generalized eruptive histiocytoma (if the lesions were raised or indurated).
All forms of mastocytosis in children have a good prognosis and systemic involvement is
rare. The majority of cases resolve spontaneously. In adults, however, systemic involvement may be aggressive or even represent a mast cell leukaemia. Symptoms of systemic
involvement or of acute degranulation of widespread cutaneous disease include flushing,
diarrhoea, nausea/vomiting, abdominal cramps and wheeze. Adults may also complain of
syncope, angina, headaches and bone pain.
Although this young patient has no symptoms of systemic disease, basic investigations
would be justified including particularly full blood count, serum tryptase and liver function tests. A skin biopsy can be performed if there is diagnostic doubt. Mast cell infiltrates
can be difficult to identify by routine haematoxylin & eosin staining, and special stains
such as Giemsa or toluidine blue, which demonstrate metaochromatic staining of mast
cells, are required. For patients with rapidly progressive disease and abnormalities of the
above investigations, further testing such as bone marrow aspirate and biopsy under the
supervision of the haematology department may be indicated. Demonstration of activating mutations of the c-kit proto-oncogene would help tailor therapy in aggressive or
leukaemic disease (e.g. imatinib).
As the skin lesions are likely to resolve spontaneously by the boy’s 10th birthday, no
treatment is indicated. For patients with skin symptoms antihistamines (H1-blocker) may
be helpful. Moderate sunlight exposure can hasten the resolution of diffuse lesions and
psoralen–UVA can be offered to adults/older children. Patients with numerous lesions or
diffuse disease should avoid mast cell degranulating agents such as non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs, opiates, alcohol, caffeine, radiological contrast media and abrupt
physical degranulation such as a hot bath or other acute temperature change, vigorous
rubbing (e.g. after a bath or by tight clothing). Exposure to degranulating agents or to
allergens (such as hymenoptera stings) can potentially provoke anaphylaxis.
KEY POINTS

• Urticaria pigmentosa is characterized by mast cell proliferation and accumulation
within the skin.

• When a urticaria pigmentosa or mastocytoma lesion is stroked, it typically urticates,
•

24

becoming pruritic, oedematous and erythematous. This change is referred to as Darier’s
sign.
Most patients with urticaria pigmentosa exhibit onset before age 2 years. The disease is
associated with an excellent prognosis, often with resolution by puberty. The number of
lesions diminishes by approximately 10 per cent a year.

CASE 11:

ACUTE SOFT TISSUE SWELLING ASSOCIATED WITH
SYSTEMIC SYMPTOMS

History
A 51-year-old man is referred for an urgent opinion with an 8-week history of intermittent
swellings affecting his hands, feet, face and genitalia. He also describes intermittent abdominal bloating and pain. Over the last three weeks he had attended the accident and emergency
department on two occasions. The first time, when he presented with lip and tongue swelling
but without shortness of breath, he was treated with antihistamines and intravenous hydrocortisone, but did not require adrenaline or intubation. On the second occasion, with acute
and severe abdominal pain associated with vomiting, he was admitted for 24 hours under the
surgical team for investigation of an acute abdomen,
before his symptoms spontaneously resolved. He
does not describe any associated urticaria but does
complain of recent-onset night sweats, weight loss
and low energy levels. He is unaware of provoking
factors and feels there is no pattern to the swellings
as they can occur at any time including overnight.
He has no previous history of atopy and is on no medication (he denies taking any over-the-counter preparations such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
drugs). He has no family history of swellings or
skin rashes. He is a non-smoker and works as a
truck driver.

Examination
His skin is normal except for the presence of unilateral left-sided peri-orbital soft tissue swelling
(Fig. 11.1). He has smooth, non-tender bilateral
axillary and left-sided inguinal lymphadenopathy.
Figure 11.1
The remainder of his examination is normal.

Questions
• What are these intermittent swellings?
• What are the possible underlying diagnoses?
• How would you investigate further?
25

ANSWER 11
The skin swellings are angioedema. Unusually in this case angioedema is occurring in the
absence of urticaria. Immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated allergic angioedema (provoked by
food, drugs, insect bites or latex) or angioedema provoked by physical stimuli (such as sun,
heat or cold) is mediated by local release of histamine and is frequently associated with hives
or urticaria. The striking other clinical features in this case include the night sweats, weight
loss and lymphadenopathy. He has anaemia and thrombocytopenia. The low complement
levels should trigger testing of C-1 esterase inhibitor (C1-INH) levels (suggesting acquired
C1-esterase inhibitor deficiency). This patient needs thorough haematological assessment
looking for an underlying lymphoproliferative disorder. Further investigations include tests for
serum lactate dehydrogenase and 2-microglobulin, immunoglobulins and protein electrophoresis, CT of the chest, abdomen and pelvis as well as lymph node and bone marrow biopsy.
When confronted with angioedema in the absence of urticaria it is important to consider diseases mediated by bradykinin such as C1-INH deficiency (which can be genetic
or acquired) or induced by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Hereditary
angioedema is autosomal dominantly inherited, and although there is a high incidence
of de-novo mutations (25 per cent), it usually presents peri-puberty or following surgery/trauma, making it a less likely diagnosis in this case. Acquired angioedema can be
associated with underlying connective tissue disease (systemic lupus erythmatosus, lupus
anticoagulant) or lymphoproliferative (particularly B-cell lymphoma) disorders.
Common to all of these disorders are symptoms of angioedema, in the absence of
urticaria, which can include laryngeal oedema or tongue and/or pharyngeal oedema
of sufficient severity as to cause airway obstruction and, potentially, asphyxia. These
bradykinin-dependent disorders can also include gastrointestinal symptoms reminiscent
of an acute abdomen with severe pain, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhoea due to oedema of
the bowel wall. Hypotension is frequently a feature.
The management of acquired angioedema includes the use of androgens (such as danazol or stanozolol) and antifibrinolytics (such as tranexamic acid) as prophylaxis. The
emphasis however is on diagnosis and treatment of the underlying disease. For hereditary angioedema, C1-INH concentrate (extracted from human plasma and freeze dried) is
available for intravenous administration.

!

Differential diagnosis of angioedema in the absence of urticaria
• IgE mediated allergy (e.g. food, latex, drugs)
• Non-IgE mediated histamine release (e.g. physical stimuli, drugs)
• Bradykinin mediated:
• Hereditary C1-INH deficiency
• Acquired C1-INH deficiency (associated with lymphoproliferative or connective
tissue disorders).
• ACE inhibitors
KEY POINTS

• Angioedema in the absence of urticaria is unusual and points towards a bradykinin-mediated
mechanism, most commonly C1–INH deficiency, either hereditary or acquired.

• Symptoms may include angioedema of the face, extremities and genitalia, abdominal
pain and bloating, hypotension and potentially laryngeal oedema leading to asphyxiation.

• Underlying autoimmune connective tissue disease or B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders
may underlie acquired angioedema.

CASE 12:

CHRONIC SCALY PLAQUES ON THE KNEES

History
A 25-year-old man presents with a rash on his knees. This had gradually worsened over
three years. In addition he had previously had dandruff and more recently noticed his
nails changing, for which his GP treated him for a fungal nail infection, but with no
improvement. He is a smoker and drinks 35 units of alcohol per week. He has noticed an
improvement during the summer months and has also developed pains in his elbow and
knees. His sister had a similar rash over her elbows.
Examination
There are erythematous plaques on his knees with clearly defined borders and overlying thick scale (Fig. 12.1). There is fine scale throughout the scalp and in his external
auditory canals. Examination of his finger nails reveal three nail plates with pitting and
onycholysis.
Questions
• What is the diagnosis?
• What are the risk factors for the disease?
• Are his joint pains relevant?

Figure 12.1

27

ANSWER 12
Clinically this patient has chronic plaque psoriasis. This is a chronic inflammatory disease
that affects 2 per cent of the population. It affects not only the skin, but can also affect
the nails and joints. Psoriasis can present in several different ways, but chronic plaque
psoriasis is characterized by well demarcated erythematous plaques which have an overlying silvery scale that frequently affects the extensor aspects of the elbows and knees, as
in this patient. Differential diagnoses of chronic plaque psoriasis include discoid eczema,
tinea corporis, lichen simplex and mycosis fungoides (T-cell lymphoma).
Risk factors for psoriasis include a positive family history. In addition, possible triggering and
exacerbating factors include stress, smoking,
alcohol, streptococcal infection and medications
such as -blockers and non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Physical trauma
can be a major factor in triggering lesions, the
so-called Koebner phenomenon.

Figure 12.2

Nail disease in psoriasis is common, affecting the fingernails and toenails. Nail changes
(Fig. 12.2) include pitting and onycholysis (separation of the nail plate from the nail bed), and
subungal hyperkeratosis. Oil spots are pathognomic and appear as yellow-brown spots under
the nail plate. Basic histopathology shows there
is marked thickening of the epidermis (plaques)
and dilated blood vessels just beneath the epidermis (erythema), and neutrophils infiltrate
up into the stratum corneum where they form
microabscesses of Munro (inflammation).

The different clinical presentations of psoriasis include guttate, pustular, erythrodermic
and palmoplantar. It is thought that 5–10 per cent of patients with psoriasis have joint
involvement known as psoriatic arthritis, which may precede, present with, or most commonly follow, the skin involvement. There are five different clinical types: asymmetric
(mono– or oligoarthropathy), symmetrical polyarthritis (rheumatoid arthritis-like), distal
interphalangeal joint disease, arthritis mutilans, and ankylosing-spondylitis–like.
Chronic plaque psoriasis can be treated with topical therapy including emollients, steroid
ointments, vitamin-D analogues, coal tar-based preparations, dithranol, salicylic acid and
phototherapy. Joint disease may respond to NSAIDs, methotrexate or ciclosporin.
Systemic drugs are reserved for moderate-to-severe recalcitrant disease and include
ciclosporin, methotrexate, acitretin and in more recent years the biologics that include
the biologics such as infliximab, which has anti-tumour necrosis factor activity.
KEY POINTS

• Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory disease affecting 2 per cent of the population.
• It affects not only the skin but can also affect the nails and joints.
• There are multiple modalities of treatments including topical, phototherapeutic and
systemic drug preparations.

CASE 13:

WIDESPREAD SCALY ERUPTION APPEARS AFTER
A SORE THROAT

History
An 18-year-old girl develops a widespread rash 5 days after a sore throat. She had presented in a similar way 2 years ago to her GP who treated her with antibiotics and the
rash had faded. She does not feel unwell in herself and has no other symptoms.
Examination
There are multiple erythematous small discrete plaques and papules with overlying
scale predominantly over her trunk but also
affecting her limbs (Fig. 13.1). Her face and
scalp have been spared. Her nails are normal. Examination of her throat reveals some
erythema over her pharynx, but no pustules
are seen.

Figure 13.1
INVESTIGATIONS
Throat swab: group A -haemolytic Streptococcus

Questions
• What is the most likely diagnosis?
• How would you manage her?
• What is the prognosis?

29

ANSWER 13
This patient is suffering from guttate psoriasis. This is a scaly skin eruption that appears
rapidly after the onset of a streptococcal throat infection. This type of psoriasis is predominantly seen in adolescents and young adults. The word guttate is derived from the
Latin name gutta which means ‘drop-like’. The differential diagnosis includes Pityriasis
rosea.
Classically, in guttate psoriasis lesions are symmetrical mainly over the trunk and limbs
with crops of papules and small plaques with overlying scale. Throat swabs may confirm
the presence of group A -haemolytic Streptococcus. Blood tests may reveal an increased
antistreptolysin titre.
Patients with guttate psoriasis respond well to phototherapy. Mild topical steroid can be
used but it is challenging to apply the medicated ointment accurately to the affected skin
only. As a general rule thin plaques of psoriasis respond well to ultraviolet B (UVB) light
and thicker plaques respond to UVA light given with oral psoralen (PUVA).
This patient’s throat swab confirmed a streptococcal infection and she was therefore
treated with 10 days of erythromycin antibiotics. It is thought that treating the underlying bacterial infection can shorten the length of the skin eruption. Her skin cleared with
narrow-band UVB phototherapy (TL-O1) given three times per week for 4 weeks.
Occasionally, guttate psoriasis can evolve in some patients into chronic plaque psoriasis, many of whom have a positive family history of psoriasis. The majority of patients,
however, are clear of the lesions after a few weeks. Patients may have recurrent ‘attacks’
associated with bacterial throat infections, as in this case.
KEY POINTS

• Guttate psoriasis often is associated with a preceding streptococcal throat infection.
• It is predominantly seen in adolescents and young adults.
• Patients with guttate psoriasis respond well to phototherapy.

CASE 14:

A PATIENT PRESENTS ACUTELY UNWELL WITH ALL HIS
SKIN RED AND HOT

History
A 50-year-old man presents to the on-call dermatologist with a 3-day history of rigors,
feeling generally unwell and redness of all his skin associated with scaling. He also
complains of swelling of his arms and legs. Since his teenage years he has suffered with
a scaly scalp and occasional dry patches on the elbows. There is a family history of psoriasis. Recently he has been experiencing increasing episodes of angina and has sought
medical attention.
Examination
There is widespread erythema affecting the face, trunk and limbs with thickening of the
skin and associated widespread scale (Fig. 14.1). Thick scale is present throughout the
scalp with dystrophy of all 20 nails. Over the elbows erythematous plaques with overlying
thick scale are seen. In addition there are mild bilateral ectropions.
Questions
• What is the likely diagnosis?
• What is the differential diagnosis?
• How would you manage this patient?
• What are the potential complications?

Figure 14.1

31

ANSWER 14
The most likely diagnosis is erythrodermic psoriasis. Erythroderma is when almost the
entire skin ( 90%) becomes red; in the case of psoriasis the skin is also thickened and
scaly. There is usually hyperkeratosis of the palmar/plantar sites. There may be onycholysis (lifting of the nail plates) and even shedding of the nails. Thinning of the hair and
alopecia may also occur. Clues in this patient to the underlying cause of his erythroderma
are his dystrophic nails and classic plaques of psoriasis over his elbows. In addition he
has a history of scalp scaling and a family history of psoriasis.
Erythrodema is a serious and at times life-threatening dermatological emergency.
Erythrodermic skin is associated with fever, rigors and lymphadenopathy.
Other causes of erythroderma include atopic eczema, drug eruptions, cutaneous T-cell
lymphoma, allergic contact dermatitis, pityriasis rubra pilaris and seborrheoic dermatitis.
To diagnose the underlying cause can be very challenging and signs and symptoms of
pre-existing dermatoses may help, as in this case.
Complications result from significant physiological and metabolic changes that occur
when the skin barrier function starts to fail. Thermoregulatory control is lost, leaving
patients vulnerable to hypothermia due to excess heat loss. Dehydration commonly
occurs owing to increased transepidermal water. Cutaneous inflammation may mask
concurrent secondary skin infection and blood cultures may be positive owing to their
easy contamination with normal skin flora. Hypoalbuminaemia and cardiac failure are
serious complications that particularly affect the elderly.
Treatment is supportive. In-patient management and skilled nursing care are essential.
Close monitoring of pulse, blood pressure, temperature and fluid balance is mandatory.
Hourly emollient therapy with liquid paraffin and mild topical steroids are the mainstay
of the acute phase. The use of systemic corticosteroids in the acute setting is controversial, as there is some evidence they can exacerbate the condition and may even have been
the initial trigger. Adequate nutritional support to minimize protein losses is important.
Haemodynamic instability and intercurrent infections are treated as necessary.
Patients usually require systemic therapy; historically ciclosporin has been given for
its fast mode of action. However, some dermatologists are now treating these very sick
patients with first-line systemic anti-tumour necrosis factor alpha preparations such as
infliximab.
KEY POINTS

• Erythroderma is when almost the entire skin ( 90%) becomes red.
• It is a serious and at times life-threatening dermatological emergency.
• Management is supportive in addition to treatment of the underlying cause.

CASE 15:

AN ITCHY ERUPTION APPEARING ON THE CHEST AND
ARMS AFTER SUN EXPOSURE

History
A 20-year-old girl develops a rash 24 hours after commencing her holiday in the sun.
The rash is itchy and red affecting her neck and forearms, there is sparing of her face
and hands. The rash persists for approximately one week before settling with no scarring.
She has no previous history of skin problems, although her mother had suffered a similar
rash whilst on a sunny holiday.
Examination
There are clusters of confluent erythematous urticated papules and plaques on her neck
(Fig. 15.1) and the extensor aspects of her arms. The rest of the skin is clear.

Questions
• What is the diagnosis?
• How would you manage this patient in
the short/long term?

Figure 15.1

33

ANSWER 15
This patient has polymorphic light eruption (PLE) or ‘prickly heat’. This is a very common
recurring photodermatosis of unknown aetiology. It is more commonly seen in women
and occurs usually about 24 hours after sun exposure as in this case. The pruritic eruption usually persists for 7–10 days. It is characterized by a polymorphous rash that can
include erythematous macules, patches, papules, plaques, and sometimes vesicles and
bullae. These typically affect the extensor forearms and ‘V area’ of the neck. The eruption
classically spares the face, as in our patient.
The onset of PLE usually starts in the first three decades of life and then usually occurs
each spring or early summer thereafter. Many patients improve by the end of the summer
but the rash occurs the following spring or following a ‘winter sun’ holiday. The degree
of severity is variable. There is sometimes a family history of photosensitivity.
PLE is a clinical diagnosis based on the history and it is therefore important to exclude
other causes of photosensitive dermatoses such as photoallergic contact dermatitis, photo
drug eruptions and lupus erythematosus. A skin biopsy can be helpful if there is any
doubt.
Topical steroids are the mainstay of treatment for patients presenting with the pruritic
eruption of PLE. A short course of systemic corticosteroids may be required for severe
attacks. Patients should be advised to protect themselves from the sun by wearing a shirt
with long sleeves. Sunscreens with high factor ultraviolet (UV) A and UVB filters can be
helpful in some patients. Some patients benefit from prophylactic phototherapy (narrowband UVB) given before the onset of spring to ‘harden’ the skin and thus prevent PLE
when sunlight becomes more intense.
KEY POINTS

• PLE or ‘prickly heat’ is a common eruption occurring during the spring or early summer.
• It occurs usually 24 hours after sun exposure and persists for 7–10 days.
• Other photodermatoses should be excluded in the first instance.

34

CASE 16:

ACUTE-ONSET LINEAR BLISTERING ON THE LEGS

History
A 33-year-old woman presents with a sudden-onset blistering rash on her legs. On closer
questioning she reports no recent history of travel or contact with animals. She recently
moved into new accommodation and has been clearing an overgrown garden over the
past few days. She has been clearing weeds by hand but wore garden gloves and borrowed a strimmer from a friend to cut through long grass. She felt an intense itching on
her lower legs and then noticed blisters in a streaking pattern. She has no previous history
of skin disease or atopy and is otherwise well.
Examination
Linear vesicular lesions with associated erythema and excoriations are seen on her legs
(Fig. 16.1). There are tense bullae filled with clear serous fluid. Full skin examination is
otherwise unremarkable including mucosal membranes.
Questions
• What is the most likely diagnosis?
• What is the underlying cause?
• How would you manage this patient?

Figure 16.1

35

ANSWER 16
This patient is suffering from phytophotodermatitis, which is a phototoxic skin eruption.
This acute inflammatory condition is triggered by the combination of skin contact with
photosensitizing chemicals in plants plus sunlight. Patients usually report burning or
itching of their skin prior to the onset of blistering. The characteristic skin patterns result
from the plant brushing against bare skin whilst outdoors.
The diagnosis is made on the history of plant exposure and from the clinical appearance
of linear blisters, usually on exposed skin. The morphology of the rash looks very exogenous (linear or bizarre-shaped streaks) with erythema, vesicles, bullae and oedema which
classically resolve leaving post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation. Although gardeners are
most commonly affected, exposure to lime-juice in the preparation of drinks outdoors is
another typical presentation.
Phytophotodermatitis usually occurs in the spring and summer months. The main photosensitizing substances found in plants are called furocoumarins, which consist of
psoralens, 5,8-methoxypsoralens, angelicin, bergaptol and xanthotal. The most common
plant family implicated is the Umbelliferae, which includes giant hogweed, celery, wild
parsnip and parsley. Other plant families that cause phytophotodermatitis are Rutaceae
(lime) and Leguminosae (beans).
The characteristic rash may appear within minutes to hours after exposure to the plant
and utraviolet light, but more usually erupts 24 hours (peak 48–72 hours) after exposure.
Phytophotodermatitis is a self-limiting skin eruption; however, it is intensely itchy and
blistering. Super-potent topical steroid should be applied twice daily to the affected area
for 1–2 weeks. Large tense bullae should be deflated with a sterile needle. Advice should
be given to patients concerning the use of personal protective clothing if continuing with
similar outdoor work.

KEY POINTS

• Phytophotodermatitis occurs due to the combination of skin contact with photosensitizing
chemicals in plants plus sunlight.

• The main photosensitizing substances found in plants are called furocoumarins.
• The acute eruption should respond to potent topical steroids.

CASE 17:

CHRONIC BLISTERING ERUPTION ON THE
DORSAL HANDS

History
A 49-year-old man presents to the dermatology out-patient clinic with a 6-month history of a gradually worsening rash on the dorsi of his hands. He had first noticed a few
small blisters developing in the early spring and since then more have appeared. He is
concerned about the scarring marks left on his hands. He has recently been made redundant and as a result has been drinking large quantities of alcohol. He has no history of
previous skin problems or atopy. He is otherwise well and does not take any regular
medication.
Examination
Over the dorsi of his hands are scattered tense vesicles and bullae with multiple erosions,
scarring, milia and pigmentation (Fig. 17.1). Full skin examination reveals similar small
scars on his face and minimal hypertrichosis. The rest of the skin is normal.
Questions
• What is the diagnosis?
• What is the underlying cause?
• How would you confirm the diagnosis?

Figure 17.1

37

ANSWER 17
This patient was not aware that he was photosensitive due to the insidious onset of his
skin eruption over many months. Medical practitioners should suspect photosensitivity
if skin disease affects exposed skin sites – classically the face, hands and anterior chest.
On direct questioning, patients may report a worsening of their skin condition during the
summer or following a holiday abroad.
This patient was diagnosed with porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT) which usually presents
between the 3rd to 5th decades. The condition is characterized by skin fragility leading
to blister formation following minor trauma. Initially, skin changes include tense vesicles/bullae and erosions on a background of normal-looking skin. However, these heal
to leave small atrophic scars and milia (inclusion cysts) as seen in this patient. Waxylooking plaques and hypertrichosis may also be seen.
Porphyrins are important in the formation of haemoglobin, myoglobin and cytochromes.
The porphyrias are diseases in which specific enzyme deficiencies lead to the accumulation of intermediate metabolites in the porphyrin biosynthesis pathway. Porphyrins
absorb light in the 400–405 nm range (the lower range of visible light). This absorbed
light is then transferred to cellular structures, causing damage to tissues. Deficiency of
the enzyme uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase (UROD) is responsible for PCT, which may
be inherited or acquired. Patients with acquired disease are deficient in UROD in their
liver and therefore express the disease phenotypically when triggered by agents such as
alcohol, oestrogen and hepatitis C. Familial PCT is inherited in an autosomal dominant
fashion with a resultant defect in the synthesis of UROD.
A skin biopsy reveals subepidermal bullae. Wood’s lamp examination of the urine shows
orange red fluorescence. A porphyrin screen reveals raised uroporphyrin I in the urine
and increased levels of isocoproporphyrins in the stool.
Treatments include eliminating possible trigger factors such as alcohol. Patients should
be protected from both ultraviolet and visible light. Management includes venesection to
reduce iron stores or low-dose oral chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine.
KEY POINTS

• PCT occurs due to deficiency of the enzyme uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase.
• It may be inherited or acquired. Triggers include alcohol, oestrogen and hepatitis C.
• Skin changes include fragility, tense vesicles/bullae, erosions, atrophic scars and milia.

CASE 18:

SUN-INDUCED SKIN PAIN, REDNESS AND SCARRING
IN A CHILD

History
A 16-year-old boy with scarring over his face is referred to the dermatology out-patient
clinic. He reports a history of burning and stinging of his skin (especially his nose) whilst
outside playing football. On direct questioning his parents recall as a small child he would
cry after a few minutes of sun exposure. His parents had also noted his skin would then
turn red and blister. Consequently, as a young child they tried to keep him out of the
sun as much as possible. However, as a teenager keen on sports he has recently noticed
a deterioration of the skin on his face. He is otherwise well and takes no medication.
Examination
Over his cheeks and nose the skin appears waxy and atrophic with multiple areas of pitted
scarring (Fig.18.1). Areas of hyperpigmentation and milia are seen on the dorsal aspects
of his hands.

Questions
• What is the underlying diagnosis?
• How might you confirm this?
• What other diseases may be associated?

Figure 18.1

39

ANSWER 18
This patient has erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP) which is a rare, hereditary autosomaldominant metabolic disorder of porphyrin metabolism. Patients usually report symptoms
starting in early childhood. Photosensitivity may be severe with almost immediate stinging, burning and itching following sun exposure. Erythema, oedema, vesicles and purpura
appear within 1–8 hours predominantly over the nose, cheeks and dorsi of the hands.
Similar symptoms can occur when a person is exposed to sunlight through window glass.
Over time these areas develop into shallow, atrophic and often linear scars. Diffuse wrinkling of the skin on the nose, cheeks and perioral area can also occur leaving a waxy
appearance. The skin over the metacarpal phalangeal joints can become indurated and
shiny (‘aged knuckles’).
EPP results from a deficiency in the enzyme ferrochelatase. This defect occurs at the step
in porphyrin metabolism where protoporphyrin is converted to haem by ferrochelatase,
deficiency of which leads to a high accumulation of protoporphyrin which is highly photosensitizing. Red blood cells (RBC) and faeces show increased levels of protoporphyrins.
Fresh RBCs fluoresce coral red when examined in a dark room under ultraviolet light.
Approximately 10 per cent of patients with EPP may have underlying haemolytic anaemia, hypersplenism and cholelithiasis (including in young children). Associated liver
disease is common, but fortunately rarely leads to fatal hepatic failure requiring hepatic
transplantation.
Management includes education concerning photoprotective measures to prevent exposure to ultraviolet and visible light. Patients should avoid any unnecessary exposure to
sunlight and should wear photoprotective clothing / wide-brimmed hat. If possible, tinted
windows should be installed.
Patients / medical practitioners should remember that other strong sources of light can
also trigger symptoms, including indoor fluorescent and halogen lights. Patients with EPP
should have strict photoprotection of their skin during surgical procedures, as operating
lights can trigger severe attacks. Oral -carotene can be effective in some patients in
reducing photosensitivity.
KEY POINTS

• EPP is a rare, hereditary autosomal dominant disorder of porphyrin metabolism.
• Patients usually present in childhood with photosensitivity.
• The mainstay of management is photoprotection.

CASE 19:

SUDDEN-ONSET WIDESPREAD RASH

History
A 38-year-old woman presented with a lump in her breast and was diagnosed with
peripheral T-cell non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma stage 3A. She underwent six cycles of CHOP21 chemotherapy; however, a PET (positron emission tomography) scan revealed residual
disease in her mediastinal lymph nodes. During a planned admission for a BEAM autologous stem cell transplantation she developed a widespread, mildly pruritic skin eruption.
The rash started on her upper body and spread distally over 24 hours. She had received
pre-conditioning chemotherapy and prophylactic antimicrobials (azithromycin, penicillin, fluconazole, aciclovir) 4 days prior to the onset of the eruption.
Examination
There are multiple erythematous macules and papules scattered diffusely over her trunk
and limbs (Fig. 19.1), with relative sparing of her face. There are no pustules, blisters or
scaling. The eruption blanches on pressure.

Figure 19.1
41

ANSWER 19
The patient has developed a drug rash called toxic erythema; this was confirmed histologically from the skin biopsy. This is the most common type of cutaneous drug eruption.
Classically, it spreads in a craniocaudal direction and is mildly pruritic. The rash is symmetrical and consists of a myriad of very small erythematous papules and macules. The
individual lesions blanch on pressure. There are no blisters or pustules, the palms and
soles are spared. Toxic erythema usually starts within two weeks of taking a new medication. Sudden-onset widespread rashes are usually ‘reactive’ with the two most common
underlying causes being ‘drugs or bugs’.
The key to identifying the culprit drug is the taking of a detailed history of the patient’s
medications and the time course over which each was started in relation to the onset of
the rash. In this case the drug responsible is penicillin. If possible, the culprit drug should
be stopped; however, if the drug is vital for the patient’s underlying condition then
toxic erythema can be managed with a moderately potent topical steroid and emollients.
Usually the rash fades over a few weeks with desquamation.

KEY POINTS

• Toxic erythema is the most common type of drug rash.
• The rash spreads in a craniocaudal direction and consists of erythematous macules and
papules.

• Common culprit drugs include antibiotics, anticonvulsants, allopurinol, non-steroidal
anti-inflammatories, and thiazides.

RECURRENT ANNULAR ERYTHEMATOUS LESIONS
REACTIVATING AT IDENTICAL SKIN SITES

History
A 40-year-old woman is referred to the dermatology clinic with a history of erythematous
skin lesions appearing on her face, neck and chest over the past six weeks. She complains
of a burning and slight itching with the onset of new lesions that then settle over a few
weeks leaving marked pigmentation on her skin. Intermittently she has developed new
lesions in addition to the old lesions flaring. She had no previous history of skin problems. Past medical history includes mild asthma, hayfever and hypertension. Her medication includes becotide and salbutamol inhalers, simvastatin, atenolol and ramipril; the
latter was commenced within the last 2 months to help control her hypertension.
Examination
There are multiple annular hyperpigmented
macular lesions on the skin over her face,
neck and upper chest (Fig. 20.1). No new
erythematous lesions or recently ‘reactivated’
lesions are apparent at the time of this clinic
appointment.

Figure 20.1
INVESTIGATIONS
Histology from her skin biopsy showed a resolving inflammatory interface dermatitis (at the
junction between the epidermis and the dermis) with numerous lymphocytes and dying
keratinocytes (civatte bodies). There was scattered melanin pigment in the upper dermis.

Questions
• What is the diagnosis?
• What is the likely cause?
• How would you manage this patient?

43

ANSWER 20
This patient was diagnosed with a fixed drug eruption (FDE), which is an interesting
phenomenon where exposure to a particular medication leads to annular erythematous
skin lesion(s) which heal with pigmentation. Repeated exposure to the drug invariably
causes reactivation of the old skin lesion(s) and may cause new ones to appear. Solitary
skin lesions most commonly occur in FDE and preferentially occur on the genitalia and
lips. This patient had the multiple FDE variant where lesions more frequently appear on
the arms and trunk. There are reports of FDE lesions occurring on the genitals in patients
who are allergic to their sexual partner’s medication.
The morphology of the skin lesions in FDE is somewhat variable, however. Classically
they are circular or oval, macular or bullous and heal with pigmentation. Some FDE eruptions can be so inflammatory that central skin necrosis can result.
The exact mechanism of FDE is not known. Our current understanding is that the medication acts as a hapten which binds to keratinocytes within the epidermis. This triggers
the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines which attract T-cells (CD4 and CD8) into the
affected skin site. Reactivation of the skin lesions in response to re-exposure to the medication activates memory T-cells at the identical skin site(s). Histological appearances of
involved skin show the action is at the dermoepidermal junction.
The onset of FDE usually starts within two weeks of commencing a new medication.
In this case the most likely culprit is the ramipril owing to the temporal relationship
between commencement of the drug and the onset of the skin lesions. The most common
culprit drugs include antibiotics, anticonvulsants and analgesics. However, FDE has been
reported as being associated with many other preparations including over-the-counter
medications, supplements, minerals and even foods.
The diagnosis of FDE is usually straightforward with a good history and classic clinical
signs. If it is unclear which medication may be the culprit then an oral challenge can be
useful. Histological appearances from lesional skin can help support the clinical diagnosis
of FDE but is usually not diagnostic. Once the culprit medication has been identified this
should be stopped. A potent topical steroid can be applied to any active lesions, which
will help settle any symptoms and inflammation rapidly.
KEY POINTS

• FDE lesions on the skin are reactivated each time the culprit drug is ingested.
• Lesions are frequently solitary and have a predilection for the lips and genitals.
• Skin lesions are often annular with central blistering/necrosis that settles with pigmentation.

CASE 21:

PAINFUL LIP LESION ASSOCIATED WITH A LOCALIZED
BLISTERING RASH AND SORE MOUTH

History
A 39-year-old man is referred by his GP to the on-call dermatologist with a 3-day history
of a sore throat, painful mouth and blistering rash. One week prior to the onset of his
painful mouth and rash he developed a sore on his upper lip. The sore on his upper lip and
widespread blistering eruption had first occurred at the age of 7 years and had erupted
on four previous occasions. He feels well in himself but is having difficulty eating due to
his painful mouth. His past medical history includes diet-controlled diabetes, hypertension and hypercholesterolaemia. He was commenced on amlodipine and simvastatin two
years previously.
Examination
Annular target-like lesions are seen over his lips (Fig. 21.1) and blistering annular lesions
over his hands, elbows and trunk (Fig. 21.2). Within his mouth are painful blisters
(Fig. 21.3) and eroded erythematous ulcers.

Figure 21.1

Figure 21.2

Figure 21.3

INVESTIGATIONS
He is apyrexial, blood pressure is 140/88 mmHg, and pulse is normal. Viral and bacterial
swabs, and skin biopsy were taken through a blister.

Questions
• What is the underlying diagnosis and what secondary phenomenon has occurred?
• How would you treat the patient initially?
• What management would you instigate to prevent further similar attacks?
45

ANSWER 21
When patients present with a sore ulcerated mouth the differential diagnoses include
aphthous ulcers, viral stomatitis such as caused by herpes simplex virus (HSV), shingles
(herpes zoster virus), Behçet’s disease, immunobullous disease (pemphigus vulgaris), vitamin/iron deficiency, neutropenia, and adverse drug reactions.
The clue to the underlying cause of this patient’s oral ulceration was the preceding sore
on his upper lip – herpes labialis (‘cold sore’) caused by HSV type 1 was isolated from
a viral swab. Subsequent to his HSV infection he developed erythema multiforme (EM).
This manifested in this patient as oral ulceration and target lesions on his lips and focal
skin sites. Histology of the skin biopsy showed marked dermal oedema and subepidermal
blisters containing neutrophils and eosinophils.
Target lesions of EM are typically seen on the face, elbows, knees, palms and soles (socalled ‘acral sites’). The lesions themselves consist of erythematous annular rings with a
central papule or vesicle. However, as the name suggests, the cutaneous eruption can be
variable in appearance (multiforme).
With EM there may or may not be involvement of mucous membranes. EM minor is cutaneous involvement at the typical acral sites; EM major has the same cutaneous eruption
(10 per cent epidermal detachment) plus involvement of one or more mucous membrane sites. This can be distinguished from Stevens–Johnson syndrome that has 10–30
per cent skin surface area with epidermal detachment and always significant mucous
membrane involvement. Drugs rather than infections are more commonly associated with
the onset of Stevens–Johnson syndrome. The cause of EM is usually an infection rather
than a medication, with HSV and Mycoplasma pneumoniae most commonly implicated.
This patient presented too late to be treated with aciclovir for his herpes labialis (which
should be initiated in the first 72 hours to be effective), however he was commenced on
aciclovir 400 mg daily as secondary prophylaxis against further episodes. Moderately
potent topical steroid was applied to all the EM lesions and he rinsed his mouth with
the NSAID benzydiamine hydrochloride (Difflam) mouthwash, four times daily. Some
patients develop recurrent EM despite prophylactic aciclovir. In these cases a systemic
immunosuppressive agent such as azathioprine or ciclosporin may be needed to prevent
further attacks of EM.
KEY POINTS

• Erythema multiforme (EM) is a reactive skin eruption that is usually the result of an
underlying infection.

• Although the appearance of the skin lesions can be variable, target-like lesions at acral
sites are classically seen.

• EM with mucous membrane involvement (lips, genitals, nose) is termed EM major.

CASE 22:

PAINFUL ERODED MUCOUS MEMBRANES AND SKIN
LESIONS

History
A 35-year-old female presents with a 2-day history of a sore throat, malaise and a rash. The
cutaneous eruption has spread rapidly over the two days to involve her trunk, limbs and
face. Her eyes feel gritty and sore. Her lips have become crusted and painful. Three weeks
previously her antiepileptic medication had been changed from topiramate to carbamazepine.
Examination
The cutaneous eruption consists of dusky erythema which is patchy on her face and limbs but
more confluent over her trunk. Between 20 and 30 per cent of the skin surface is involved in
the eruption. Blisters are seen centrally within erythematous, atypical, target-like lesions and
there are purpuric macules. Nikolsky’s sign is positive (sloughing-off of the epidermis under
lateral pressure). She has chelitis with erythema, crusting and bleeding. There are erosions
and small areas of skin necrosis (Fig. 22.1). The nasal mucosa and genital tract are spared.
INVESTIGATIONS
Her temperature is 38.4 °C, blood pressure 138/80 mmHg, and pulse 96 bpm. A skin
biopsy was taken for histology and immunofluorescence. She has mildly deranged liver
function.

Figure 22.1
47

ANSWER 22
This patient has developed Stevens–Johnson syndrome (SJS) secondary to carbamazepine.
SJS is a severe, immune-complex mediated, drug hypersensitivity eruption that affects
the skin and mucous membranes. Patients feel unwell and should be admitted to hospital
for high-dependency care. SJS usually develops within two months of commencing a
new medication. Patients characteristically develop a sore throat, eyes, lips and genitals
as the mucosae become inflamed and eroded. Skin lesions affect 10–30 per cent of the
skin surface with a variable morphology: erythematous macules, atypical target lesions
with central blisters, dusky purpuric lesions, erosions and necrosis. As the skin becomes
denuded there is a high risk of secondary bacterial infection.
Patients with SJS need management in hospital by a multidisciplinary team including
dermatologists, high-dependency doctors and nurses, ophthalmologists and oral physicians. This patient also required care from the neurologists to determine and monitor an
alternative anti-epileptic medication.
The management of SJS is essentially supportive. The culprit medication should be
stopped immediately (if the culprit is unclear then all mediations should be stopped
if possible). Patients require intensive nursing care with hourly applications of topical
50:50 white soft paraffin with liquid paraffin, non-adherent dressings to denuded areas
and a non-adherent bodysuit to help reduce cutaneous pain and secondary infection.
Patients should be kept in a warm room and fluid balance monitored. Chlorhexidine
mouthwash, regular eye drops, and supportive nutrition may be required. Active treatments may include prednisolone, methyl-prednisolone, intravenous immunoglobulin
and/or ciclosporin.
KEY POINTS

• SJS is a serious drug hypersensitivity reaction that requires high-dependency care.
• Skin lesions are of variable appearance but develop rapidly with mucous membrane
involvement.

• Management is supportive plus treatment with oral prednisolone or other
immunosuppressants.

ACUTE-ONSET EXTENSIVE BLISTERING AND SKIN
NECROSIS WITH MUCOUS MEMBRANE INVOLVEMENT

History
A 34-year-old woman who was 24 weeks pregnant
developed sudden-onset sore eyes, mouth and genitalia associated with blisters on her skin. She was
admitted to hospital by the obstetricians who referred
her to the on-call dermatologist. The patient was
diagnosed with HIV at antenatal screening and had
been commenced on HAART (highly active antiretroviral therapy) – Combivir and nevirapine – 2 weeks
ago. Over the last 24 hours she has felt unwell with a
fever, malaise, sore throat, gritty eyes and a painful
stomatitis. Initially she had a few blisters on her face
and upper trunk but over a few hours these spread to
involve extensive areas of her trunk and limbs.
Examination
She is unwell and distressed. Her temperature is 38.2 °C,
blood pressure 180/100 mmHg and pulse rate 110 beats/
min. There is crusting and bleeding of her lips, her
conjunctiva are severely injected and she has inflamed
nasal mucosa. The genital region is inflamed and ery- Figure 23.1
thematous. She has numerous flaccid and tense blisters over her face, limbs and trunk with
many areas becoming confluent with small areas of complete tissue necrosis and skin loss
(Fig. 23.1). More than 30 per cent of her skin surface is affected, Nikolsky’s sign is positive.

Questions
• What is the most likely cause of this patient’s sudden-onset skin eruption?
• What is the prognosis for the patient and her baby?
• How would you manage them?
49

ANSWER 23
This presentation with widespread skin loss is typical of drug-induced toxic epidermal
necrolysis (TEN). Nikolsky’s sign is positive when lateral pressure is applied to the skin
and the top layer sloughs off, and is found in TEN, Stevens–Johnson syndrome and staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome and immuno-bullous diseases. The most likely culprit
drug here is the antiretroviral nevarapine. Currently physicians are unable to predict
which patients will develop severe drug eruptions; however, they are more common in
patients with HIV. The trigger antigen sets off a cascade of cell-mediated immune reactions including the activation of cytotoxic lymphocytes and natural killer cells resulting
in full-thickness skin necrosis (confirmed on the skin biopsy).
TEN is a dermatological emergency. Patients should be managed in the intensive care unit
by a multidisciplinary team including a dermatologist. Many patients with TEN require
sedation and ventilation. The offending drug should be stopped immediately. Topical
50:50 white soft paraffin with liquid paraffin should be applied hourly to all the skin,
topical antibiotics and non-adherent dressings (Jelonet®) should be applied to denuded
areas. Patients should be kept in a warm room. Fluid and enteral nutrition are essential
to compensate for high insensible fluid losses and high protein demands. The evidence
for other proactive interventions are mainly anecdotal: many units will treat patients
with a total of 2–4 mg/kg of intravenous immunoglobulin over 4 days and 3 mg/kg per
day of ciclosporin.
TEN has a reported mortality rate of around 20–40 per cent. The mortality rate for any
individual patient can be estimated by calculating their SCORTEN – based on seven criteria:  40 years of age, pulse  120 bpm, underlying malignancy,  10 per cent body surface involved, urea  10 mmol/L, bicarbonate  20 mmol/L and glucose  14 mmol/L.
The higher the number of these criteria the patient has, the worse the prognosis
(mortality: 1/7
3 per cent, 2/7
12 per cent, 3/7
35 per cent, 4/7
58 per cent,
5–7/7 90 per cent).
This patient had a normal healthy baby delivered at term by caesarean section and was
switched to Kaletra, lamivudine and tenofovir.
KEY POINTS

• TEN is a dermatological emergency requiring meticulous skin care and supportive
therapy.

• Patients usually require sedation and ventilation on the intensive care unit.
• The patient’s prognosis can be estimated by calculating their SCORTEN.

Questions
• What is the dermatological diagnosis?
• What management would you initiate?
51

ANSWER 24
This patient was diagnosed with a drug hypersensitivity syndrome called DRESS (drug
rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms). The symptoms and signs of DRESS
may be misdiagnosed as an ongoing infection as patients having a swinging temperature, malaise, lymphadenopathy, a skin rash and eosinophilia. The systemic part of the
syndrome can manifest with internal organ involvement most commonly liver, lung or
kidneys. The mortality rate is around 10 per cent.
The cutaneous manifestations of DRESS can vary quite widely. However, most patients
have quite erythematous and oedematous skin especially in the head and neck region.
Patients may present with marked oedema around their eyes and ears. The morphology of
the widespread skin eruption may be macular, papular, coalescing plaques, occasionally
vesicular or pustular lesions, and there may be areas of desquamation. Mucous membranes
are spared. The rash may be mildly itchy, the skin may feel tight and uncomfortable.
Marked reactive lymphadenopathy is usually present in the cervical and axillary lymph
node basins. The patient’s fever is usually marked and swinging. Patients look and feel
unwell. Eosinophilia and raised liver function tests are commonly seen but may lag
behind the onset of the skin eruption.
The most common drugs implicated in DRESS include antibiotics and anticonvulsants.
DRESS usually occurs within 8–12 weeks after commencing the culprit drug. The phenytoin was the drug implicated in this case and was therefore stopped immediately. The
patient was treated with pulsed intravenous methyl prednisolone (1 g daily for 3 days)
and then a tapering course of oral prednisolone starting at 40 mg daily and reducing
down slowly over 6 weeks.
There is rapid normalization of the patient’s temperature and eosinophil count with commencement of systemic steroids. The hepatitis may not settle for several weeks, and may
even deteriorate further before settling. In severe cases of reactive hepatitis in DRESS
patients may eventually require liver transplantation due to the acute liver damage.
KEY POINTS

• DRESS can often present with clinical signs and symptoms that may be misdiagnosed as
an infection.

• A lag of 8–12 weeks occurs between starting the culprit medication and the onset of
DRESS.

• DRESS has a 10 per cent mortality rate; the culprit drug should be stopped immediately
and systemic steroids given.

Questions

• What is the likely cause?
• How would you manage this patient?

53

ANSWER 25
This patient presented with a very dramatic tender skin eruption called AGEP (acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis). This is a pustular drug eruption, most likely caused
in this case by penicillin. AGEP is characterized by multiple pin-point pustules which are
very monomorphic in nature and appear in sheets on an erythematous background. There
is often accentuation in the flexural areas such as axillae and groin. Swabs are negative
for organisms as the pustules are sterile. In contrast infected cutaneous pustules tend to
be at different stages of evolution varying in size and shape, the erythema tends to be
localized around each pustule rather than diffuse; lesions may be crusted.
The differential diagnosis includes acute pustular psoriasis. Some patients may have a
past history of psoriasis (usually the chronic plaque form) in which the skin suddenly
becomes unstable (this can be triggered by oral prednisolone) and develops multiple
sterile pustules within the psoriatic plaques. Pustules are usually prominent around the
periphery of the areas of erythema rather than as sheets of pustules throughout. Rarely,
it may be difficult to differentiate between AGEP and pustular psoriasis, as some patients’
first presentation of psoriasis may be with the acute pustular form.
Pateints with AGEP frequently have a fever and mild to moderate malaise. Blood tests usually show a neutrophilia and a mildly raised CRP. Patients may therefore be misdiagnosed
as having a skin infection due to staphylococcal bacteria. Histology from the skin biopsy
shows subcorneal collections of neutrophils, which is supportive of the diagnosis of AGEP.
In psoriasis there is usually an associated thickening of the epidermal skin layer – so-called
acanthosis – which is absent in AGEP.
The drug implicated in AGEP should be stopped immediately if at all possible. Pustules
usually resolve over 1–2 weeks. To speed the cutaneous recovery, systemic corticosteroids
should be given. Topical treatment with 50:50 white soft paraffin with liquid paraffin
should be applied to the skin every 2 hours in the acute phase. Secondary infection by
Staphylococcus bacteria to eroded areas can occur before the skin heals. In the meantime patients can loose heat and fluids through their impaired skin barrier causing high
insensible fluid losses.

KEY POINTS

• AGEP is an acute-onset drug eruption characterized by sheets of monomorphic pustules
on red skin.

• The pustules in AGEP are sterile and represent a toxic drug reaction and not a skin
infection.

• The culprit drug should be stopped and systemic/topical steroids used to treat the
patient.

CASE 26:

ACUTE NON-BLANCHING CUTANEOUS ERUPTION
ASSOCIATED WITH A SORE THROAT

History
A 62-year-old man presents to the accident and emergency department with a 2-day
history of an asymptomatic skin eruption appearing mainly on his trunk and limbs. It
seems to have started after visiting his local swimming pool and he had wondered if the
chlorine in the water may have triggered the skin rash. He is otherwise fit and well but
has recently had a sore throat and temperature but no cough. He has no previous history
of skin problems. He is referred to the on-call dermatology team.
Examination
There is a widespread eruption mainly on the lower limbs and trunk but also to a lesser
extent on his arms. The morphology of the rash is purple and non-blanching; lesions are
starting to coalesce and are mainly macular but some are papular (Fig. 26.1). His tonsils
are erythematous with some surface exudate and he has tender cervical lymphadenopathy.
His temperature is 38.7 °C.
INVESTIGATIONS
Throat swab, urine dipstick and skin biopsy were taken.

Questions
• What is the likely cause of the skin
eruption?
• What pathological process would be
seen on the skin histopathology?
• What is the differential diagnosis of
this skin rash?

Figure 26.1

55

ANSWER 26
Non-blanching skin eruptions usually indicate bleeding into the skin, blockage of cutaneous blood vessels or reduced blood flow (viscosity/stasis). The underlying cause may be
benign such as pressure on the skin, or serious such as bacterial meningitis.
Small pin-point areas of bleeding into the skin, so-called ‘petechiae’, can occur due to
leakage from small cutaneous capillaries (capillaritis), pressure on the skin (from tight
bandages/compression stockings) or vascular damage due to infections. Larger areas of
bleeding into the skin (ecchymoses) can occur on the limbs of elderly patients following
minor trauma, as their skin is thin and fragile.
Macular areas of purple non-blanching skin are usually the result of red cell leakage or
bleeding (low platelet count). Palpable purpura by contrast is usually associated with an
acute inflammatory process such as vasculitis. Acute and severe vascular damage may
result in skin necrosis.
This patient had acute vasculitis (leucocytoclastic vasculitis), which is inflammation of
the blood vessels. This inflammation leads to leakage of red cells and ultimately blockage of skin blood vessels. Skin biopsy is extremely helpful in confirming the clinical
suspicion of vasculitis. Histology from affected skin shows tissue swelling, perivascular
inflammation and fibrin blocking cutaneous blood vessels. Neutrophils around the vessels are frequently killed (leucocytoclasis) and remnants of them (‘nuclear dust’) are seen
scattered in the dermis.
The throat swab from this patient confirmed a streptococcal infection, which is the likely
underlying cause of his vasculitis. He was treated with oral penicillin V and potent topical steroids.
The differential diagnosis of a vasculitic rash includes bacterial meningitis, Streptococcus,
hepatitis C/B, autoimmune diseases (lupus, polyarteritis nodosa, rheumatoid), drug reaction and malignancy.
Investigations of cutaneous vasculitis might include the following: skin biopsy, urine
dipstick (for blood/casts), full blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, renal/liver
function, streptococcal serology (ASOT), hepatitis serology, antinuclear antibodies (ANA),
extractable nuclear antibodies (ENA), antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA),
rheumatoid factor, coagulation screen, antiphospholipid antibodies, blood pressure, and
chest X-ray.
KEY POINTS

• Acute-onset non-blanching purple skin eruptions can indicate a serious underlying
cause.

• Skin biopsy can help to distinguish between true vasculitis and simple blood vessel
leakage.

• A vasculitis screen may help to elucidate the underlying cause.

CASE 27:

AN ITCHY PAPULAR ERUPTION ON THE ANKLES

History
A 47-year-old woman is seen in the dermatology clinic with a 5-month history of itchy
eruption consisting of lesions mainly on her feet but also scattered on her legs. The rest of
her skin is unaffected. She does not complain of any symptoms in her mouth or involving the genital area. On direct questioning she had noticed that some of her nails have
become slightly brittle and are liable to splitting. No one else in the family is currently
affected, although she thinks her mother had suffered with a similar skin eruption some
years previously. She is otherwise well and not taking any regular medication.
Examination
There are multiple, discrete, purplish, shiny flat-topped papules over the dorsum of her
feet; some of the lesions have a lacy white pattern over their surface (Fig. 27.1). Further
similar lesions are seen scattered on her lower legs; some of the papules are clustered
in a linear fashion demonstrating Koebner’s phenomenon. A number of her fingernails
have longitudinal ridges on them with ‘V-shaped’ nicks. Her mouth, genital region and
scalp are all normal.
Questions
• What is the diagnosis?
• What triggers are known to be associated with this skin disease?
• What are the treatment options for this
patient?

Figure 27.1

57

ANSWER 27
This woman was diagnosed with cutaneous lichen planus. The aetiology of the eruption
is unknown; however, it is thought to be an immunologically mediated disease and is
known to be associated with autoimmune diseases and hepatitis C. Recent articles suggest
that 16 per cent of patients with lichen planus have underlying hepatitis C. In addition
numerous medications have been implicated in triggering lichenoid drug reactions
including diuretics, -blockers, NSAIDs, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, statins
and tetracyclines. A familial tendency has been reported in association with certain
human leucocyte (HLA) types being implicated including HLA-B7, HLA-DR1/10.
Clinically lichen planus presents with an insidious onset, mildly to intensely pruritic
eruptions especially seen on the flexor aspects of the wrists but also scattered on the
limbs and trunk. The lesions themselves are usually papules that are purplish in colour,
shiny and firm on palpation. There may be a fine white lacy pattern of scale on the
surface of the lesions (Wickham’s striae). Lesions may form discrete nodules/plaques
and become quite hyperkeratotic. A scarring alopecia can develop due to scalp involvement, so-called lichen planopilaris. In addition to the cutaneous eruption, patients may
have involvement of the mouth and genital mucosae with sore erosions and ulceration.
Nails changes may also feature and are characterized by longitudinal ridges and brittle
‘V-shaped’ nicks in the distal nail plate.
The diagnosis is usually made on clinical grounds. However, histological features seen on
a skin biopsy can be helpful in distinguishing between lichen planus and lichenoid drug
eruptions when a drug trigger is suspected.
Most lichen planus settles within months to years and responds well to potent topical
steroids, phototherapy or short courses of oral prednisolone. Orogenital involvement,
however, may be more persistent and recalcitrant and may require prolonged systemic
immunosuppressant therapy such as mycophenolate mofetil.

KEY POINTS

• Lichen planus is an itchy papular eruption of insidious onset.
• In extensive or atypical disease think about a possible drug trigger or underlying
hepatitis C.

• Cutaneous lesions respond to potent topical steroids but orogenital disease is more
recalcitrant.

CASE 28:

A GENERALIZED ITCHY BLISTERING ERUPTION IN
AN ELDERLY WOMAN

History
A 67-year-old woman presents to the accident and emergency department with a 6-day
history of severe, painful and progressive blistering. She had attended her GP eight weeks
earlier with a worsening ‘burning itchy’ eruption. She had been diagnosed with urticaria
and been started on a regular antihistamine with no benefit. Two weeks ago she had
attended her dental practitioner with painful oral erosions, and is awaiting specialist review.
Her past medical history includes a cholecystectomy
and borderline abnormal thyroid function tests, for
which she is on no therapy currently. She is an
ex-smoker. There are no other remarkable features
in her history.

Figure 28.1

Examination
The patient is clearly uncomfortable at rest and it is
painful for her to move during the examination. She
has two small ( 5 mm) healing erosions on her right
buccal mucosa and a fresh tense blister (~7 mm) on
her hard palate. The rest of her oral examination is
normal. She has a symmetrical erythematous urticated eruption over the lateral aspects of her trunk,
her submammary area, medial upper arms, and
thighs and central back. Within these erythematous
lesions there are multiple tense fluid-filled vesicles
( 5 mm) and bullae ( 5 mm) (Fig. 28.1). Her genital mucosa is normal. The remainder of her physical
examination is normal.

ANSWER 28
This is clearly a widespread, evolving and aggressive, blistering eruption. In addition to
establishing a diagnosis and ruling out any underlying medical disorders, the priorities
for this patient are pain relief and prevention of infection. Pain relief would include
simple measures such as reducing friction to eroded areas of the skin (with easy-release
dressings and/or greasy emollients) and minimizing activity, as well as pharmacological
pain relief. Preventing infection can be challenging: barrier nursing and use of topical
antiseptics such as potassium permanganate, triclosan and chlorhexidine, particularly
when washing, are frequently advocated.
The age of the patient, her history and presentation, and eosinophilia are highly suggestive of a diagnosis of bullous pemphigoid. Other autoimmune bullous diseases could
be considered in the differential diagnosis, in particular: inflammatory epidermolysis
bullosa acquisita (a mucous membrane pemphigoid, which often has a more insidious
onset with more mucosal involvement than skin); erythema multiforme major (usually
more haemorrhagic mucosal involvement and targetoid lesions); and bullous vasculitis
(usually purpuric skin lesions in association with blistering, especially of the lower
extremities). Occasionally bullous pemphigoid can be associated with underlying
conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease or occult malignancy or be provoked
by medication (e.g. furosemide, ACE inhibitors, and recently anti-TNF monoclonal
antibody therapy).
Bullous pemphigoid is characterized by circulating and tissue-bound pathogenic
anti-cutaneous basement membrane zone antibodies. These can be detected by
immunofluorescence studies (on skin and
serum). Figure 28.2 demonstrates positive green fluorescence of tissue-bound
antibodies along the cutaneous basement
membrane. Immunosuppression with systemic corticosteroids and steroid-sparing
agents is the cornerstone of treatment;
although for patients with milder or more
localized disease superpotent topical corticosteroids alone may be sufficient to
achieve disease control. Remission over a
period of years is expected; however, prognosis is adversely affected in the elderly by
their frequent co-morbidities.

KEY POINTS

• Bullous pemphigoid frequently affects elderly individuals, presenting as painful tense
bullae on a pruritic urticated base. Mucosal involvement is not usually a major feature.

• As well as the necessary investigations to confirm the diagnosis, co-morbidities and occult
underlying diseases should be sought prior to initiation of immunosuppressive therapy.

• The natural history is for bullous pemphigoid to remit over years, but the adverse effects
of immunosuppressive treatment on the elderly can be significant.

SUDDEN ONSET OF EROSIONS, BLISTERS AND
FRAGILE SKIN FOLLOWING GRADUALLY
WORSENING MOUTH ULCERS

History
A 29-year-old lawyer attends the accident and emergency department with a sudden
and severe skin eruption. She has a 3-day history of a rapidly progressing, painful, erosive eruption affecting her upper trunk and intertriginous (groin and axillae) areas. She
is unable to sleep and finds dressing and undressing difficult as her skin ‘sticks’ to her
clothes and then tears off. The eruption is occurring on the background of a 4-month
history of painful ‘ulcers’ in her mouth and on closer questioning also her genital skin,
which she had attributed to stress. She has been avoiding hot, spicy or hard food for a
couple of months.
She is otherwise well and is on no medication. Her mother has type 2 diabetes and hypertension. Otherwise there is no family history of significant skin or medical disorders.

Examination
She has a widespread skin eruption over her trunk, within her axillae and groin, and
involving the inner lips of her vulva. There are multiple discrete and coalescing lesions.
The individual lesions are erythematous and tender with overlying erosions, flaccid bullae
and friable scale (Fig. 29.1). There are similar erosions involving the mouth, particularly
the lips and buccal mucosae. Nikolsky’s sign is positive. The remainder of her physical
examination is normal.

• What is the management?

Figure 29.1
63

ANSWER 29
Nikolsky’s sign occurs in patients with active blistering diseases – firm sliding pressure
with a finger separates normal-looking epidermis, producing an erosion.
The presence of flaccid blisters on an inflammatory base affecting the skin and mucosa
in this age group is most suggestive of a diagnosis of pemphigus vulgaris. Differential
diagnoses to consider include other immunobullous diseases such as bullous pemphigoid,
linear immunoglobulin A (IgA) disease or dermatitis herpetiformis, erythema multiforme
or Stevens–Johnson syndrome. If the lesions were confined to the skin only, pemphigus
foliaceous or staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome could be considered.
The diagnosis of pemphigus vulgaris, an intra-epidermal antibody-mediated autoimmune
blistering disease, is made on skin biopsy. Histology of a blister shows separation at the
suprabasal layer of the epidermis with acantholysis or individual separation of single
keratinocytes. Immunofluorescence of peri-lesional skin will demonstrate intercellular
IgG throughout the epidermis (Fig. 29.2). Circulating antibodies against desmosomal
adhesion molecules (desmogleins 1 and 3) can also be detected, their titre often reflecting
the severity of disease.
Pemphigus is a chronic skin disease associated with significant morbidity and formerly,
before the synthetic corticosteroid era, a significant mortality due to infection and electrolyte imbalance secondary to fluid loss. Although pemphigus is frequently responsive
to systemic steroids, nowadays the side effects of long-term steroid treatment mean that
patients are frequently treated with steroid-sparing agents such as azathioprine or mycophenolate mofetil. The use of plasma
cell targeting with rituximab, an antiCD20 monoclonal antibody, has been
shown to dramatically reduce circulating autoantibodies and can provide disease control. Extensive skin
involvement such as this case may
require in-patient management for
supportive treatment, skin care, sepsis
prevention and pain relief. Specialized
dressings which do not adhere to
fragile skin may be used, but frequently patients are nursed in such
a way as to minimize friction and
Figure 29.2
trauma to the skin.

KEY POINTS

• Pemphigus vulgaris is a chronic, antibody-mediated autoimmune blistering disease
affecting skin and mucosa.

• Diagnosis is confirmed by the demonstration of bound intercellular antibodies in vivo
•

64

within the epidermis by direct immunofluorescence and circulating antibodies targeting
desmogleins 1 and 3 by indirect immunofluorescence.
Immunosuppressive treatment particularly aimed at antibody suppression is the
cornerstone of therapy. Pain relief and prevention of secondary infection are crucial.

AN ITCHY, VESICULAR EXTENSOR ERUPTION
ASSOCIATED WITH MALABSORPTION

History
A 32-year-old carpenter presents with a 3-month history of an itchy, and ‘stinging’ eruption. He had already been treated with a course of anti-scabies topical therapy and had
used a moderately potent topical steroid in combination with antihistamine for 4 weeks
with no benefit. He has no significant past medical history and is on no other medication.
He comments that the eruption occurs in crops, with small fluid-filled blisters appearing
in very itchy patches.
He is one of five siblings, one of his sisters has type 1 diabetes
mellitus and his mother is hypothyroid. On systems review he
admits to fatigue and 4 kg unintentional weight loss associated
with a change in stools over the past several months, which he
attributes to stress at work.

Examination
He has pale, freckled skin, and a symmetrical but patchy eruption, with erythematous and eczematous epidermal change
studded with excoriated erosions and crusted papules, clustered
particularly over his elbows (Fig. 30.1), buttocks and shoulders.
He has no mucosal lesions and no evidence of scabies burrows.
The remainder of his physical examination is normal.

ANSWER 30
The important clues to the diagnosis here are as follows: the distribution of the eruption;
the history of pruritic vesicles; the positive family history of probable organ-specific
autoimmune disease; his symptoms and blood test results suggestive of an underlying
medical disorder. Although the clinical features in Fig. 30.1 are rather non-specific, the
lack of response to the treatments already tried in combination with the clues before
would all be suggestive of a diagnosis of dermatitis herpetiformis (DH). This is an autoimmune blistering disease characterized by intensely itchy polymorphous vesicular lesions
located over the extensor surfaces, back and scalp. It can be difficult to identify vesicles
as they are often excoriated, but when the vesicles are present they can be clear, fluidfilled or pus-filled. A routine skin biopsy of peri-lesional skin will show papillary dermal
neutrophilic microabcesses. Direct immunofluorescence shows immunoglobulin A (IgA)
deposition within the papillary dermis.
DH is a cutaneous manifestation of coeliac disease (gluten-sensitive enteropathy). Both
conditions are immunological reactions to ingested gliadin (found in wheat, rye and
barley). Serology to detect circulating anti-endomysial and anti-tissue transglutaminase
IgA antibodies help to confirm the diagnosis, but a small bowel biopsy should also be
performed. Occasionally the features of DH precede the pathological small bowel features
of coeliac disease.
A gluten-free diet (GFD) is the treatment of choice for both DH and coeliac disease;
importantly it has a protective effect against small bowel lymphoma. Dapsone therapy
may be required to gain control of the skin disease. However, after several months of
compliance with a GFD this need is usually eliminated.

CASE 31:

AN ITCHY BLISTERING ERUPTION RECURRING IN A
SECOND PREGNANCY

History
A 31-year-old woman is referred urgently by her local antenatal service complaining of an
8-day history of extensive and severe itchiness associated with an evolving tender eruption, which began on the palms of her hands and has spread along the inner aspects of her
arms and now involves her trunk. She is at 21 weeks’ gestation with her second pregnancy.
Her first child is now 2 years old and was born at
38 weeks +3 days by normal vaginal delivery. Her
postpartum period, however, was complicated by a
similar widespread pruritic eruption, which blistered
within her axillae and upper arms. That eruption
began 2 days post-delivery and had responded completely to a potent topical steroid within 10 days. She
is otherwise well. Her only medication is an iron and
folate supplement that was started before conception.

Examination
She is normotensive and continues to slowly gain
weight according to her antenatal records. She has
widespread urticarial plaques over her palms, medial
aspects of her arms, axillae, inner thighs and trunk
(Fig. 31.1). There are two tense fluid-filled bullae
overlying the erythema in her left axilla. There is no
involvement of her mucous membranes. A recent fetal
ultrasound scan confirmed her dates to be correct and
did not identify any anomalies or abnormalities.

Questions
• What is this eruption and what are the possible differential diagnoses?
• How can you confirm the diagnosis?
• What is the management of this patient?
67

ANSWER 31
The clinical features in this case (specifically the distribution of the eruption and the presence of blisters) and the patient’s history of a similar, possibly milder eruption occurring
at a later stage of a previous pregnancy are highly suggestive of a diagnosis of pemphigoid gestationis (PG). Other differential diagnoses include pregnancy-specific dermatoses,
primarily pruritic urticarial papules and plaques of pregnancy (a non-bullous eruption),
and non-pregnancy associated eruptions (e.g. erythema multiforme, acute urticaria, scabies, allergic contact dermatitis, bullous pemphigoid, or other immunobullous diseases).
Cholestasis of pregnancy is important to consider when faced with a pruritic patient in
her mid-trimester without an eruption. It is associated with elevated serum bilirubin and
a significant risk of fetal prematurity.
PG is a pregnancy-associated subepidermal immunobullous disease, analogous to bullous pemphigoid. The diagnosis can be confirmed by the demonstration of tissue-bound
and circulating immunoglobulin G antibodies and complement, targeting the cutaneous
basement membrane zone by direct and indirect immunofluorescence studies, and also
by subepidermal blisters on histology.
There are several considerations when forming a management plan. First, the fetal outcome in PG is generally good; second, it is a self-limiting condition that is expected to
remit following delivery (although it may occur earlier and in a more severe form during
subsequent pregnancies). However, the intractable pruritus and associated blistering may
lead to significant maternal morbidity. Superpotent topical steroids and systemic corticosteroids are used to control the eruption.

KEY POINTS

• Pemphigoid gestationis (PG) is a pregnancy-associated subepidermal immunobullous
disease analogous to bullous pemphigoid.

• PG presents with tense blisters overlying pruritic urticarial plaques.
• PG usually presents towards the end of the third trimester, however it may occur earlier
and behave more aggressively in subsequent pregnancies.

CASE 32:

EXTREMELY ITCHY STRETCH MARKS IN THE THIRD
TRIMESTER

History
A 31-year-old woman presents during the 35th week of her first pregnancy. She is very
anxious about the development of extremely itchy ‘lines’ over her abdomen over the last
two days. She is otherwise well with an unremarkable antenatal history to date. Her dates
are confirmed on ultrasound scanning. She has no previous history of skin problems.
Examination
She has striking erythematous, linear, urticated lesions in a concentric and, in some areas,
coalescing distribution over her pregnancy-distended abdomen (Fig. 32.1). The eruption
corresponds with the striae distensae and there is sparing of the umbilicus. She has a
few similar lesions over her upper thighs. She is normotensive and the remainder of her
examination is normal. It is of note that according to her antenatal notes she has gained
5 kg since her last antenatal check 3 weeks ago. Urine dipstick is negative.

Questions
• What is this eruption?
• What other diagnoses would you
consider?
• What are the implications for the baby?

Figure 32.1

69

ANSWER 32
This presentation with a very pruritic eruption beginning in the third trimester of the
first pregnancy and arising within the striae distensae (sparing the umbilicus) is typical of pruritic urticarial papules and plaques of pregnancy (PUPPP), also referred to as
toxic erythema of pregnancy or polymorphic eruption of pregnancy. Over a few days the
eruption can become more widespread involving the trunk and extremities; less commonly, annular or polycyclic lesions develop. It is thought that maternal weight gain may
somehow precipitate the lesions. Anecdotally it is more often associated with male fetus
pregnancy and the risk of PUPPP seems to be higher with multiple gestation pregnancies.
It is important to consider other pregnancy-specific pruritic eruptions (such as pemphigoid gestationis, intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy) as well as common eruptions
unrelated to pregnancy (such as urticaria, drug eruptions, viral exanthems, scabies). A
comprehensive examination for evidence of scabies is indicated as well as investigations
to rule out pemphigoid gestationis (skin biopsy for direct immunofluoresence studies).
Although PUPPP can be very symptomatic and consequently distressing for the affected
mother, the eruption itself is not thought to have any adverse effects on the fetus.
Management is therefore based on symptomatic relief with cool baths, light clothing,
emollients and topical corticosteroids, as well as reassurance.

KEY POINTS

• Pruritic urticarial papules and plaques of pregnancy (PUPPP) is a benign pregnancy
dermatosis which usually arises in the third trimester.

• The most distressing aspect of the eruption is the associated pruritus. It is otherwise
self-limited with no adverse effects on fetal outcome.

• The pathomechanism of the eruption is unknown but it is more commonly observed
in association with recent, sudden weight gain, male fetus and multiple gestational
pregnancies.

ASYMPTOMATIC SCLEROTIC WHITE PLAQUES ON THE
TRUNK

History
A 30-year-old woman presents with 10-month history of asymptomatic skin lesions
developing over her trunk. Initially the lesions were red oval patches, which over many
months became hard and the skin white. She does not have any joint problems, there is
no family history of skin disease and she is otherwise well.
Examination
There are scattered, oval, indurated shiny white plaques with a purplish, poorly defined
border predominantly over her trunk (Fig. 33.1). Some of the lesions have now become
more hyperpigmented.
INVESTIGATIONS
Blood tests, skin biopsy.

Questions
• What is the diagnosis?
• What are the possible triggers?
• How should the patient be managed?

Figure 33.1

71

ANSWER 33
This patient’s skin biopsy confirmed the clinical diagnosis of morphoea. Palpation of the
skin is an extremely important part of a dermatological examination. Plaques of morphoea feel very firm to the touch and the surface of the skin has lost its normal texture.
The skin feels smooth and often waxy. Histopathology shows a proliferation of collagen
in the dermis and subcutis. The cause of this localized dermal scleroderma is unknown.
Women between the ages of 20–50 years are most commonly affected. The lesions
themselves are usually asymptomatic. Skin changes are usually localized and initially
erythematous/violaceous oval plaques which progress into ivory-coloured, hardening
plaques measuring 1–20 cm in diameter. Morphoea may be circumscribed, generalized,
linear and occasionally involve underlying structures (pansclerotic).
This patient had the generalized form of the disease with multiple plaques over her trunk.
Linear morphoea, in contrast, normally affects the extremities, particularly over the frontoparietal scalp/face where a deep-seated form of linear scleroderma ‘en coup de sabre’
can occur. The sclerotic skin grows no hair and the underlying skull bone may become
distorted.
Although the aetiology of morphoea is unknown, recognized triggers include local skin
injury, post-radiation and viral infections such as measles. A small proportion of patients
with classical morphoea developed the disease following tick bites, which transmit Lyme
disease due to Borrelia burgdorferi infection. Autoantibodies may be positive including
rheumatoid factor, antinuclear and antihistone antibodies.
The clinical course is generally slowly progressive, although some cases can ‘burn out’
and others spontaneously resolve. Extensive sclerotic plaques on the limbs can be associated with stiffness, weakness and loss of mobility.
Management is difficult. However, some success has been with topical vitamin D analogues (calcipotriol), intralesional and systemic corticosteroids, methotrexate, ciclosporin
and psoralen–UVA/UVB or UVA1.

KEY POINTS

• Morphoea appears as ivory-coloured, hardening plaques.
• It can be circumscribed, generalized, linear and may affect underlying structures.
• The aetiology is unknown, but triggers include local skin injury and viral infections.

CASE 34:

INSIDIOUS ONSET OF TIGHTENING OF THE SKIN
OVER THE LIMBS

History
A 54-year-old woman presents to the dermatology out-patient clinic with a two-year
history of a gradual tightening of the skin over her fingers, forearms and legs. She also
describes intermittent swelling of the hands and feet. Since her early 30s she had experienced pain in her digits on exposure to cold weather. Over the past few months she had
noticed shortness of breath on exertion.
Examination
The skin over her fingers and hands appears oedematous, waxy, shiny, and indurated;
normal skin elasticity has been lost. The distal fingers appear tapered and there is a
small ulcer present on one of her finger pulps (Fig. 34.1). She has periorbital oedema and
evidence of facial telangiectasia. On respiratory examination there are fine inspiratory
crackles in the bilateral lower zone.
Questions
• What is the unifying diagnosis?
• Which organs may be involved?
• How should this patient be managed?

Figure 34.1

73

ANSWER 34
This patient was diagnosed with systemic sclerosis, which is a multisystem disease characterized by fibrotic and vascular abnormalities in association with autoimmune changes.
This particularly affects the skin, lungs, heart and gastrointestinal tract.
The earliest skin changes are usually swelling of the hands and feet. Prior to this, however, patients may describe a long history of Raynaud’s phenomenon, which is characterized by the fingers/toes undergoing a triphasic colour change from pallor (white),
cyansois (blue) and rubor (red) following exposure to the cold. This occurs due to episodes
of vasospasm, which causes peripheral vessels to constrict.
In association with intermittent hand and foot swelling are telangiectasia, which are
visible dilated blood vessels occurring on the hands, face and chest. The hands have a
characteristic appearance as in this patient including thickening of the skin over the fingers, which eventually leads to scarring (sclerosis). Fingers then become spindle-shaped
with tapering, termed sclerodactyly, and feel tight and stiff. Skin tightening can result in
difficulty opening the mouth (microstomia) and a ‘beak-like’ pinched appearance of the
nose. Other late changes include finger pulp ulcers and even loss of digits.
This is a multisystem disorder affecting the gastrointestinal tract including oesophageal reflux, constipation, diarrhoea and malabsorption. Cardiorespiratory involvement
includes pulmonary fibrosis and pericarditis. Renal involvement affects 50 per cent of
patients. Joint and muscle pain occurs along with weakness and limited movement,
resulting in contractures.
The diagnosis is generally made from the patient’s clinical history and examination of the
skin and other organs. Up to 90 per cent of patients have elevated antinuclear antibodies
(ANA). Anticentromere antibodies are characteristic. Scl-70 is unique to systemic sclerosis and is more likely to be associated with severe systemic sclerosis involving the lungs.
Management of systemic sclerosis is challenging with as yet no cure. The course of this
disease is progressive. Patients should be advised to keep their hands and feet warm with
special warming gloves and fleecy boots. Vasodilating drugs and calcium channel blocking drugs may be beneficial. H2-blockers may reduce the gastrointestinal symptoms. Oral
corticosteroids, cyclophosphamide and tacrolimus may be of benefit for limited periods.
D-penicillamine may also help. Renal disease is the commonest cause of death, followed
by cardiorespiratory disease.

KEY POINTS

• Systemic sclerosis is a progressive, multisystem autoimmune disease.
• It particularly affects the skin, lungs, heart and gastrointestinal tract.
• There is no cure and so management is with supportive care.

ACUTE FACIAL RASH, FEVER AND JOINT PAINS IN A
YOUNG WOMAN

History
A 23-year-old African Caribbean patient presents with an acute-onset facial rash. She has
no rash elsewhere and no previous history of skin problems. She had taken an antihistamine for suspected allergy reaction as her face had become slightly swollen and red.
Her family had become increasingly worried and took her to the local accident and
emergency department. During her assessment she complained of a two-week history of
general malaise, fatigue, fever and weight loss. On a systems review she admitted to having
experienced intermittent joint pains involving her hands and knees.
Examination
She has a subtle erythematous confluent eruption present over her cheeks and nose which
is ill-defined and slightly oedematous (Fig. 35.1); there is minimal scaling. The rest of her
skin examination is normal including the scalp and nails, however she does have two
ulcers present on her oral mucosa. She has tenderness in the small joints of her hands.
Her temperature is 38.4 °C.

ANSWER 35
This type of clinical presentation can be a diagnostic challenge. Patients presenting with
fever, malaise and weight loss may be suspected of suffering from systemic infections or
malignancy. However, this patient had a facial rash and arthritis which should raise the
possibility of a connective tissue disease. Consequently this patient was diagnosed with
a serious multisystem autoimmune disease – namely systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).
Patients with acute SLE classically develop a ‘butterfly rash’ over their cheeks and nose
which is an erythematous, confluent, oedematous/macular eruption in the shape of a butterfly. Cutaneous lesions are found in 75 per cent of patients, including urticaria, bullae,
photosensitivity, nailfold telangiectasia, calcinosis, vasculitis, Raynaud’s phenomenon,
diffuse/patchy alopecia and mouth ulcers. Patients may present acutely unwell with fever,
weight loss and malaise. SLE is more common in women than men and is more common
in African Caribbeans.
Multisystem involvement with serological or haematological abnormalities must be demonstrated to make the diagnosis of SLE within the framework of the revised American
Rheumatism Association (ARA) criteria for the classification of SLE (see Table 35.1).
Virtually any organ system can be affected by SLE including musculoskeletal (arthralgia,
arthritis, myopathy) and renal, pericarditis, pneumonitis, hepatosplenomegaly, lymphadenopathy and peripheral neuropathies. Central nervous system (CNS) involvement can
occur leading to seizures and psychiatric disturbances.

Table 35.1 The diagnosis of SLE can be made if any 4 or more of the 11 criteria are present
simultaneously or at any time during a patient’s history

Criteria

Definition

1

Malar rash

Fixed erythema, flat or raised, over the malar
eminences

2

Discoid rash

Erythematous circular raised patches with adherent
keratotic scaling and follicular plugging; atrophic
scarring may occur

3

Photosensitivity

Rash occurring following ultraviolet light exposure

4

Oral ulcers

Includes oral and nasopharyngeal ulcers, observed
by doctor

5

Arthritis

Non-erosive arthritis of two or more peripheral
joints, with tenderness, swelling, or effusion

6

Serositis

Pleuritis or pericarditis documented by ECG or rub
or evidence of effusion

7

Renal disorder

Proteinuria  0.5 g/d or 3, or cellular casts

8

Neurological disorder

Seizures or psychosis without other causes

9

Haematological disorder

Haemolytic anemia or leucopenia ( 4000/L) or
lymphopenia ( 1500/L) or thrombocytopenia
( 100 000/L) in the absence of offending drugs

10

Immunological disorder

Anti-dsDNA, anti-Sm, and/or anti-phospholipid

11

Antinuclear antibody

Abnormal ANA in the absence of drugs known to
induce drug-induced lupus syndrome

Relevant investigations include a skin biopsy for histology and immunofluorescence
where there is demonstration of IgG, IgM and C3 in a band-like pattern along the dermal–epidermal junction. Anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA) are positive in over 90 per cent of
cases. Further positive autoantibodies including anti-double strand DNA and extractable
nuclear antigen, anticardiolipin autoantiboides (lupus anticoagulant) may also be seen.
Blood tests may also reveal a normocytic, normochromic anaemia, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, raised ESR and low complement levels. Patients should be investigated for
any concurrent infections to which they are susceptible.
Management of SLE during an acute attack can be challenging. Patients often need
admission to hospital for rest, investigations and systemic corticosteroids. If there is
obvious renal and CNS involvement or significant systemic upset, then high-dose pulsed
methylprednisolone may be required. When patients are stable they should be advised
about photoprotection. Long-term management may include hydroxychloroquine for
cutaneous disease and steroid-sparing immunosuppressants such as azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil and cyclophosphamide.

KEY POINTS

• Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a serious multisystem autoimmune disease affecting mainly females.

• Clinical presentations of acute SLE may be misdiagnosed as infections/malignancy.
• Cutaneous lesions are found in 75 per cent of patients with SLE.

CASE 36:

ANNULAR ERYTHEMATOUS RASH OF SUDDEN ONSET

History
A 39-year-old patient presents to her GP with a rash of fairly sudden onset, which initially affected her chest and arms and then spread to her back. She had noticed that the
eruption started as small red spots that were dry and scaly, which then spread out in a
ring-shape. She was worried she might have caught ring-worm in the school where she
works. However, it seemed to start after her recent holiday in Spain. The rash is asymptomatic. She has no previous history of skin problems, and is otherwise well.
Examination
There is an erythematous eruption predominantly affecting her face, neck, trunk and
proximal limbs. The lesions are annular in appearance, sharply defined with an overlying surface scale. The lesions display central regression and coalesce to give a polycyclic
appearance (Fig. 36.1). Her scalp nails and mucosae are normal.
Questions
• What is the cutaneous diagnosis?
• What systemic manifestations may be
associated?
• How should this patient be managed?

Figure 36.1

79

ANSWER 36
This patient presented with the classic skin eruption of subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus (SCLE). The rash appears fairly suddenly, especially over sun-exposed sites,
and is symmetrical and scaly. There are characteristically bright red, annular, welldemarcated lesions with central regression. Overlying the erythema there is an almost
psorisiform scale. The eruption mainly affects the upper trunk (shoulders and ‘V’ of the
chest) and dorsi of the hands (sun-exposed sites). SCLE occurs in young and middle-aged
patients and is more common in females. It is usually a very persistent eruption lasting
many months.
Approximately 50 per cent of patients will also meet a few of the criteria for systemic
lupus erythematosus (SLE) as defined by the American Rheumatism Association (see also
Table 35.1). These mainly include photosensitivity, arthralgia, serositis and serologic
abnormalities. The serious organ involvement of SLE is uncommon, although renal and
CNS involvement can rarely occur and thus all SCLE patients should be investigated for
systemic disease.
Virtually all patients with SCLE have circulating anti-Ro (SS-A) and 30–50 per cent will
have anti-La antibodies. Pregnant women with Ro (SS-A) positive SCLE may give birth to
babies with neonatal lupus due to placental transfer. The rash is morphologically similar
to SCLE, but is transient. More seriously, congenital heart block can occur. The heart
block is usually permanent requiring a pacemaker and all women of child-bearing age
should be counselled accordingly. Coexistent Sjörgren’s syndrome with SCLE has been
reported.
A comprehensive drug history is essential in patients with SCLE, as the disease can be
triggered by certain medications including naproxen, nifedipine, verapamil, diltiazem
and terbinafine.
Cutaneous disease is most often the commonest concern of patients. Sun avoidance and
photoprotection are essential in all patients. Some patients do respond to potent topical corticosteroids, but many require systemic therapy to control the cutaneous disease,
including thalidomide and hydroxychloroquine. A small proportion of patients may go
on to develop SLE.
KEY POINTS

• The rash of subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus (SCLE) characteristically displays
erythematous annular lesions with central regression.

• 50 per cent of patients with SCLE will also have a few of the criteria of SLE.
• Virtually all patients with SCLE have circulating anti-Ro (SS-A) antibodies.

CASE 37:

HAIR LOSS, SCARRING RASH AND PHOTOSENSITIVITY

History
A 55-year-old woman presents to the dermatology clinic with a long history of a rash
that occurred during the spring and summer months over her face and scalp. Over the
past few years the affected area became more extensive, the skin became scarred and
she noticed her hair did not grow back. She wears a hair weave to cover the area. More
recently, however, she has developed new lesions over her cheeks and is worried about
scarring. She is otherwise well.
Examination
There are large areas of scarring with associated hypo- and hyperpigmentation. She has
alopecia predominantly over her fronto-temporal scalp (Fig. 37.1). Over the face and
vertex of the scalp there are indurated erythematous plaques with overlying scale and
follicular plugging. Her ears are similarly affected. Full skin examination was otherwise
normal as were her nails.
INVESTIGATIONS
A skin biopsy was performed.

Questions
• What is the diagnosis?
• What other investigations might you
arrange?

Figure 37.1

81

ANSWER 37
The scalp shows areas of alopecia with skin atrophy and scarring in the affected areas.
These changes are typical of discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE), which is a chronic,
persistent, often indolent disorder seen mainly in women. DLE is characterized by fixed,
indurated, erythematous plaques with overlying scale, predominantly over the face
and scalp. The plaques in DLE are often annular or polycyclic and well demarcated. As
the lesions expand, central regression occurs and, unlike in subacute cutaneous lupus
erythematosus (SCLE), atrophy and eventually significant scarring results. ‘Burned out’
lesions become pink or hypopigmented but in Asian and African Caribbean patients the
skin may also show hyperpigmentation. Permanently scarring alopecia is often a common feature which can be very disfiguring. The external auditory canals are frequently
involved as in this patient.
A skin biopsy in DLE revealed hyperkeratosis, epidermal atrophy, follicular plugging and
degeneration of the basal cell layer. A perifollicular lymphocytic inflammatory infiltrate
was seen. A positive immunofluorescence was seen in more than 85 per cent of new
lesions.
Patients should be screened for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) with a full blood
count, liver and kidney function tests, clotting time and auto-antibody titre. If the initial work-up does not reveal systemic involvement the risk of developing SLE is only
1–5 per cent. Lesions of DLE are, however, not uncommon in patients with established
SLE and can be found in up to 25 per cent of patients during the course of their disease.
Complete remission occurs in 40 per cent of all patients.
DLE without intervention can persist for many years and lead to extensive scarring. Early
diagnosis and treatment are therefore essential to prevent further scarring. The mainstay
of treatment is with photoprotection (SPF > 30). Potent topical corticosteroids can be
very effective for active lesions. Antimalarials, gold and other immunosuppressants may
be required.

KEY POINTS

• Without treatment discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE) can result in permanent scarring
and disfiguring alopecia on the scalp.

• Screening for systemic disease should be undertaken. which occurs in 1–5 per cent of
patients with DLE.

• Rigorous photoprotection is advised to try to prevent further DLE lesions appearing.

CASE 38:

AN ERYTHEMATOUS RASH AND MUSCLE WEAKNESS

History
A 59-year-old woman visited her GP as she was concerned about unexplained weight
loss. Her GP noted an erythematous rash around her eyes and over the dorsum of her
hands and referred her to the dermatology clinic. On direct questioning she does complain about difficulty in getting up out of a chair and climbing the stairs. She denies any
other symptoms apart from a persistent dry cough. She is a life-long smoker and drinks
alcohol socially.
Examination
She has erythematous flattish papules over the extensor surfaces of her interphalangeal
and metacarpal phalangeal joints (Fig. 38.1). In the periorbital region she has a violaceous
erythema with subtle oedema (Fig. 38.2). There is an erythematous non-scaly macular
rash affecting her neck and upper back. Neurological examination reveals proximal limb
weakness.

Figure 38.1

Figure 38.2

Questions
• What is the cutaneous diagnosis?
• What may be the underlying condition?
• How should this patient be managed?

83

ANSWER 38
The cutaneous manifestations of this disease may be striking or more subtle; therefore
a high index of clinical suspicion is needed to make the diagnosis of dermatomyositis.
The erythematous, purplish, flat papules over the extensor surfaces of the interphalangeal
joints are termed Gottron’s papules and are pathognomonic of dermatomyositis. The periorbital heliotrope rash with associated oedema is also highly suggestive of the diagnosis.
Erythema around the posterior and ‘V’ of the neck is the so-called Shawl’s sign. Periungal
erythema with telangiectasia may also be classically seen.
Muscle involvement is usually manifest by muscle tenderness and weakness with a proximal myopathy. Patients will describe difficulty rising from a supine position, climbing
the stairs or combing their hair. In some cases muscle involvement of the bulbar, pharyngeal and oesophageal areas can occur leading to difficulty in breathing and swallowing.
Muscle involvement may precede, follow or occur simultaneously with cutaneous disease.
Dermatomyositis is rare and the cause remains unknown. However, a high proportion of
affected patients over the age of 50 years had an associated underlying malignancy. This
patient was a smoker with weight loss and, following further investigations, was diagnosed with a carcinoma of the bronchus. The most common types of malignancies associated with dermatomyositis involve the ovary, breast, lung and gastrointestinal tract.
A skin biopsy may be helpful but histopathology is not specific to dermatomyositis.
Raised muscle enzymes are typically seen including creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase. Non-specific antinuclear antibodies (ANA) are found in most patients, specific
anti-Mi-1 is found in around 25 per cent and anti-Jo-1 in just a few. An electromyogram
of an affected muscle will generally be abnormal and biopsy of an affected muscle can
also be helpful. Magnetic resonance imaging is often the preferred investigation, if available, to show focal muscle involvement.
A moderate to high dose of oral corticosteroids is usually the initial therapy given. Steroid
sparing agents used in the second line include methotrexate, azathioprine, ciclosporin,
mycophenolate, cyclophosphamide and high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin. The
prognosis in most patients is relatively good except in those with respiratory myopathy
or with an underlying malignancy. A better prognosis is seen in individuals who receive
early immunosuppression. Most patients will require treatment for life; however, in about
20 per cent of patients the condition abates. Patients are advised to avoid excessive
sun exposure and to use photoprotective measures. Patients should be followed up and
screened regularly for the possibility of underlying malignancy which may reveal itself
in time.

KEY POINTS

• Gottron’s papules are pathognomonic of dermatomyositis.
• An underlying malignancy should be excluded in older patients.
• Early intervention with immunosuppression leads to a better prognosis.

CASE 39:

WIDESPREAD MACULOPAPULAR ERUPTION ON THE
TRUNK AND FACE WITH FLU-LIKE SYMPTOMS

History
A 24-year-old fashion design student presents to the accident and emergency department
with a 1-week history of feeling unwell with a temperature, abdominal pain, diarrhoea
and headaches. Overnight he has developed a widespread asymptomatic rash, mainly
over his face and trunk. His college friend was worried about him and brought him to
the hospital. The patient reports being previously well although he admitted to having a
penile discharge a few weeks previously that had settled spontaneously. He has not travelled outside the UK for at least 5 years. He takes no prescription medication but takes
occasional vitamin supplements.
Examination
Multiple small erythematous macules and papules were seen over the patient’s face, neck
and trunk (Fig. 39.1), with scattered lesions on his limbs. Conjunctivae were unaffected;
he had a slightly ‘coated’ tongue but no ulceration in his mouth. Genital examination was
normal. He had shotty lymphadenopathy in the cervical region.

Figure 39.1

Questions
• What investigations would you request?
• What is your differential diagnosis?
• What diagnosis do you suspect and how would you treat him?

85

ANSWER 39
Widespread erythematous maculopapular rashes are a sign of a ‘reactive’ process and
are usually caused by ‘drugs or bugs’. Antibiotics, NSAIDs, anticonvulsants and thiazide
diuretics are amongst the most common medications to result in these eruptions, termed
toxic erythema. Viral infections such as measles, Epstein–Barr virus (glandular fever),
influenzae infections and acute viral hepatitis may also present with ‘flu-like’ symptoms
and this type of non-specific skin eruption.
This patient was diagnosed with a primary human immunodeficiency virus infection
(HIV-seroconversion). Approximately 4 weeks after becoming infected with HIV it is
estimated that 70–90 per cent of patients develop symptoms that may include general
malaise, headache, sore throat, fever, abdominal pain and diarrhoea. Sixty per cent of
patients develop an asymptomatic classically morbilliform rash with erythematous macules and papules mainly on the face, neck and trunk. Mouth or genital ulcers may also
be present.
A high index of clinical suspicion is needed to make the diagnosis of primary HIV infection as the rash and the symptoms are non-specific. A detailed history of potential risk
factors should be undertaken. Symptoms of primary HIV usually start within 4 weeks of
a high-risk exposure. Known risk factors include originating from an endemic area, intravenous drug users who share needles, men who have sex with men, sex workers, people
with multiple sexual partners and unprotected sexual intercourse. Vertical transmission
from HIV-infected women to the fetus in utero is also a route of spread.
Patients should give consent for an HIV test to look for viral antigen (usually detectable
by day 8 using PCR techniques) as well as antibodies (detectable by weeks 2–4). Full
blood count may show a lymphopenia and a low CD4 count is frequently seen on T-cell
subset analysis.
Treating primary HIV infection with antiretroviral medication is controversial. At present
most doctors feel commencement of highly active antiretroviral treatment (HAART) at
the time of HIV seroconversion is optional. Many patients presenting at this stage of the
disease are being enrolled into large multi-centre trials to see if HAART is effective or
not in the short or long term. There is an increasing body of evidence, however, which
suggests that HAART may need to be started when the CD4 count drops below 350 cells/
μL, rather than 200 cells/μL as was previously thought.
KEY POINTS

• Primary HIV infection presents with non-specific flu-like symptoms and a maculopapular
rash.

• A high index of suspicion and arranging appropriate serological tests are essential to
make the diagnosis.

• Always think ‘could this be a primary HIV infection?’ when you see patients with a
reactive rash.

CASE 40:

SLOW ASYMPTOMATIC DEPIGMENTATION
OF THE SKIN

History
A 23-year-old African Caribbean man presents with a 2-year history of gradual patchy
lightening of the skin. He denies any symptoms such as itching or irritation of his skin
prior to the onset of the whitening patches. He has no previous history of skin problems
but had suffered with mild asthma as a child. He is otherwise well and does not take
medication. There is a family history of thyroid disease.
Examination
There are multiple, well-demarcated, non-scaly macules of depigmentation in a symmetrical distribution, predominantly over the trunk (Fig. 40.1). The periorbital, perioral
and genital areas are also affected. Some of the macules have tiny pigmented spots within
them.
Questions
• What is the diagnosis?
• What are the different presentations of
this disease?
• How should this patient be managed?

Figure 40.1

87

ANSWER 40
This patient presented with depigmentation (leucoderma) which was asymptomatic and
symmetrical. Causes of hypopigmentation include albinism, hypopituitarism, chemical
leucoderma such as with phenolics, and post-inflammatory change secondary to inflammatory dermatoses such as eczema. Onset in this patient was in adulthood (acquired) with
gradual deterioration, which led to the diagnosis of vitiligo.
Vitiligo is a depigmenting acquired disease that occurs due to loss of epidermal melanocytes. Vitiligo has been reported to be associated with autoimmune disease including
thyroid disease, pernicious anaemia and type 1 diabetes mellitus. The cause of vitiligo is,
however, unknown. It affects 1 per cent of the population, usually occurring between the
ages of 10 and 30 years. Vitiligo affects all racial groups, but is particularly distressing
in those with darker skin.
Vitiligo is characterized by sharply defined pale/white macules. Most commonly affected
are periorbital, perioral and anogenital areas, but also the axillae, inguinal regions and
extensor sites of the knees/elbows. Symmetrical involvement is the norm. In addition,
white hair and prematurely grey hair can occur.
There are several types: a focal type which is characterized by one or more macules;
segmental vitiligo occurs when the disease develops unilaterally, for instance, down one
leg; generalized or universal disease can also occur. In patients with lighter skin where
the contrast between disease and normal skin is less obvious, then a Wood’s light can be
very helpful to evaluate the macules.
The course of vitiligo is variable; however, most patients’ course is quite rapid at
the onset followed by a period of stability. Treatments are generally unsatisfactory.
Photoprotective advice is essential for involved skin. Cosmetic camouflage can be useful.
To induce repigmentation, topical corticosteroids and topical calcineurin inhibitors such
as tacrolimus can be effective for focal lesions. For more extensive disease phototherapy
including psoralen–UVA and narrow-band UVB are effective in some patients. Response
to phototherapy is usually evidenced initially by follicular repigmentation where tiny
macular dots of pigmented skin are seen. In extensive disease, patients may be offered
depigmentation of their remaining normal skin using monobezyl ether or hydroquinone.

KEY POINTS

• Vitiligo occurs due to loss of epidermal melanocytes.
• It has been reported to be associated with autoimmune disease.
• Focal, segmental and generalized types exist.

CASE 41:

A YOUNG ADULT WITH HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE,
IRREGULAR PIGMENTATION AND SKIN LUMPS

History
A 23-year-old woman visits the GP practice nurse because of persistently high blood pressure. During the course of her discussion she mentions incidentally that she is cosmetically troubled by ‘lumps’ on her skin, which leads the nurse to refer her to the dermatology
clinic. She describes the lumps as asymptomatic but gradually accumulating, particularly
over her trunk. She is otherwise well and on no medication. Her parents and sister are
also well with no history of hypertension, coronary artery disease or similar skin lesions.
Examination
On examination, her blood pressure is 170/110 mmHg. She has an unusual pigmentary
pattern with generalized freckling or lentigines affecting non–sun-exposed sites (such as
inframammary, axillae and groin) as well as sun-exposed sites. She has scattered tancoloured macules over her trunk and proximal legs (12 in total); these macules vary in size,
but have a regular shape and borders (Fig. 41.1). She also has soft, fleshy, non-tender, pink
to skin-coloured smooth nodules, some of which protrude and are pedunculated and some
are located deeper within the dermis. She has normal heart sounds, but she does have a
clearly audible right-sided abdominal bruit. The remainder of her examination is normal.

Figure 41.1
89

ANSWER 41
The dermatological features (cutaneous neurofibromas with axillary, groin and submammary freckling) are pathognomonic of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). Other cutaneous
features of NF1 include hypopigmented macules, cutaneous angiomas, transient xanthogranulomas and glomus tumours. She has associated hypertension, and the presence
of a unilateral bruit is suggestive of renal artery stenosis, a recognized complication
of NF1.
Further investigations are not required to confirm a diagnosis of NF1. Molecular testing can be considered, and the causative mutation in the NF1 gene can be detected in
95 per cent of cases, but there is not as yet a well-defined genotype–phenotype correlation. Imaging studies to look for central nervous system or bony features of NF1 can be
performed if symptomatic. There is no medical indication to excise the cutaneous neurofibromas as, unlike subcutaneous or plexiform neurofibromas, they are not associated
with malignant transformation. They can be a source of psychological distress.
The priority for this patient is to identify the cause of her high blood pressure and
initiate appropriate treatment. High blood pressure in NF1 can be a primary process or
may be secondary to other NF1 complications, such as renal artery stenosis or phaeochromocytoma. This patient should have urgent assessment for renal artery stenosis
(including duplex ultrasonography) and 24-hour urinary catecholamine collection to
rule out phaeochromocytoma. It is reassuring that her renal function is normal on
routine biochemistry, but a protein/creatinine ratio on a random void urine specimen
should be performed to assess the level of renal dysfunction and identify any mild
to moderate proteinuria which is frequently seen in association with renal vascular
disease.
NF1 is an autosomal dominant disorder and the responsible gene is located on chromosome 17. Its protein product, called neurofibromin, is widely expressed particularly in
the nervous system. Mutations in the NF1 gene predispose to tumour formation. Formal
genetic counselling would be advised before this patient plans pregnancy; she should be
informed of a 50 per cent risk of transmitting NF1 to each offspring. The complications
of NF1 vary between individuals and are unpredictable within families; there is a 1 in 12
risk for this patient of having a severely affected child. Where a pathogenic NF1 mutation is known, both prenatal testing and pre-implantation genetic diagnosis are available.
Approximately 50 per cent of affected individuals have new mutations, however the family of this patient should be examined for any suggestive features.

CASE 42:

AN OVERWEIGHT TEENAGER WITH THICKENED SKIN
AROUND HER NECK

History
A 13-year-old girl attends your clinic with her mother. She is complaining of skin changes
affecting her neck, which have been progressively worsening over the past 18 months.
In particular the changes are leading to name-calling at school with her peers saying her
neck is ‘dirty’. Her school attendance for the last term was only 87 per cent.
She is a very quiet girl and there is little eye contact through the consultation. Both she
and her mother acknowledge that she is overweight. Her menarche was at the age of
11 years and 3 months, her menses are irregular. She is not on medication. She is an only
child. Her mother has type 2 diabetes, hypertension and is also overweight, her father
suffers from asthma.

Examination
Her height is 163 cm and weight 97.5 kg – a body mass index (BMI) of 37 – and blood
pressure 140/85 mmHg. She has symmetrical hyperpigmented velvety thickened papillomatous plaques associated with scattered skin tags (acrochordons) around her neck,
especially posteriorly and laterally, as well as in her axillae (Fig. 42.1) and groin (intertriginous sites). She has mild to moderately severe comedonal acne over face and chest.
There are longitudinal striae over her lower abdomen and thighs. There is no evidence
of hirsutism.
Questions
• What is the problem affecting this
patient’s neck and axillae?
• What is the likely underlying pathogenesis?
• What complications might you consider?

Figure 42.1

93

ANSWER 42
The hyperpigmented, velvety thickening of the skin in the intertriginous zones, including
this patient’s neck and axillae, represent acanthosis nigricans, usually a clinical diagnosis
which very rarely requires histological confirmation. It often coexists with acrochordons.
It is thought to be caused by factors that stimulate epidermal keratinocyte and dermal
fibroblast proliferation. The most common association with acanthosis nigricans in young
patients is insulin resistance. In older patients with new-onset acanthosis nigricans, an
associated (usually aggressive) internal malignancy (particularly gastrointestinal) must be
considered. Familial and syndromic forms of acanthosis nigricans have also been identified. Many syndromes share common features, including obesity, hyperinsulinaemia and
craniosynostosis.
The definition of childhood obesity depends on age-dependent centile charts, however
a BMI of  30 kg/m2 is generally accepted as obese. The unfortunate complications of
childhood obesity are manifold. It predisposes to insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes,
hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, liver and renal disease, reproductive dysfunction and
orthopaedic problems. It also increases the risk of adult-onset obesity and cardiovascular disease. Emotional and psychosocial sequelae are widespread. Anecdotal evidence
suggests that depression and eating disorders are common in children and adolescents
referred to obesity clinics. Prejudice and discrimination against individuals with obesity
are ubiquitous within youth culture; even very young children have been found to regard
their peers who have obesity in negative ways. Social isolation, peer problems, and lower
self-esteem are frequently observed. The presence of acanthosis nigricans is an important
predictor of metabolic syndrome of insulin resistance and polycystic ovary syndrome in
later life unless the BMI is addressed.
Acanthosis nigricans is not a skin disease per se, but rather a sign of an underlying
problem. If associated with insulin resistance, the most common cause, treatment of the
metabolic abnormality may lead to improvement of the appearance of the skin. Dietary
changes and weight loss may cause the acanthosis nigricans to regress almost completely.

CASE 43:

A DRAMATIC AND PAINFUL ULCER IN A YOUNG
PATIENT WITH NO EVIDENCE OF INFECTION

History
A 26-year-old woman is referred by the orthopaedic surgeons for an urgent dermatology
opinion. Three weeks previously she had sustained a lower leg laceration at work and
had attended the accident and emergency department where the wound was cleaned and
sutured. Within four days the sutures had dehisced, so she presented to her GP who prescribed a course of flucloxacillin. Two days later, with an enlarging ulcer and increasing
pain, she attended the A&E once more. The concern was of potential extending necrotic
infection, such as necrotizing fasciitis and she was taken to theatre for urgent debridement and commenced on intravenous vancomycin and gentamicin. In theatre the ulcer
was debrided but the base, surrounding skin and fascia were all noted to be healthy. She
continued on antibiotics and daily ulcer dressing. There was no growth from any of the
swabs or samples sent for microbiological, atypical mycobacterial, viral or mycological
analysis. Over the next 10 days the ulcerated areas have continued to extend associated
with extreme pain. She also complains of lethargy and arthralgia. She is a non-smoker
and is otherwise well. She has no past medical history.
Examination
There is marked erythema and swelling of the distal third of the right lower leg, ankle
and proximal foot. There are two areas of ulceration: a smaller regularly shaped ulcer
anteromedially, and a more irregularly shaped and larger ulcer extending posteriorly
from the medial malleolus (Fig. 43.1). Both have raised, purple to red inflammatory borders. The bases of the ulcers are covered with adherent yellow slough. The surrounding
skin (particularly distal to the ulceration) is erythematous and there is marked swelling.
Pedal pulses are difficult to palpate on the affected side due to pain and swelling, however bedside Doppler studies confirm good flow.

ANSWER 43
This presentation is not typical of many types of leg ulceration; both venous and arterial
ulceration are easily excluded. The history of a penetrating injury followed by an enlarging wound and pain must raise the concern of infection and/or foreign body reaction.
Necrotizing fasciitis is a progressive, rapidly spreading, inflammatory infection located
in the deep fascia, with secondary necrosis of the subcutaneous tissues. It can be difficult to recognize in its early stage, but without aggressive treatment is associated with
a high mortality and morbidity even amongst previously fit and healthy individuals.
Other infective differential diagnoses include ecthyma (an ulcerative pyoderma of the
skin caused by group A -haemolytic Streptococci) and sporotrichosis (a subcutaneous or
systemic infection caused by Sporothrix schenckii, a rapidly growing dimorphic fungus).
Cultures in this circumstance should be continued for at least six weeks before being
declared negative.
The lack of positive culture despite provision of surgically obtained affected tissue samples, as well as the lack of response to broad-spectrum systemic antimicrobial agents,
makes infection unlikely. The clinical features would be consistent with the presentation
of pyoderma gangrenosum. The diagnosis of pyoderma gangrenosum is one of exclusion,
histopathological features can include massive neutrophilic infiltration, haemorrhage,
and necrosis of the overlying epidermis; however, they are non-specific. Approximately
50 per cent of patients with pyoderma gangrenosum have an underlying systemic disease such as inflammatory bowel disease, myelodysplasia, lupus or other autoimmune
diseases. Full systemic work-up to exclude these conditions is essential, as treatment of
the underlying disorder may improve the cutaneous features.
Treatment of pyoderma gangrenosum can be challenging. Surgery should be avoided, if
possible, because of the pathergic phenomenon that may occur with surgical manipulation or grafting, resulting in wound enlargement. Topical therapies include gentle local
wound care and dressings, superpotent topical corticosteroids and antiseptic precautions.
Systemic immunosuppression with agents such as corticosteroids, ciclosporin, mycophenolate mofetil, cyclophosphamide, anti-tumour necrosis factor agents such infliximab
and even intravenous immunoglobulins are used. Adequate pain relief is crucial.
KEY POINTS

• Pyoderma gangrenosum is an uncommon ulcerative cutaneous condition of uncertain
•
•

96

aetiology. Ulcerations of pyoderma gangrenosum may occur after trauma or injury to
the skin in 30 per cent of patients; this process is termed pathergy.
The diagnosis is made by excluding other causes of similar appearing cutaneous ulcerations, including infection, malignancy, vasculitis, collagen vascular diseases, diabetes
and trauma.
Therapy of pyoderma gangrenosum involves the use of anti-inflammatory agents, such
as corticosteroids, and immunosuppressive agents.

SLOW-ONSET ASYMPTOMATIC LESIONS ON THE
SHINS OF A DIABETIC PATIENT

History
A 23-year-old woman attends the dermatology clinic complaining of the appearance
of asymptomatic lesions on her legs. She has a background of type 1 diabetes mellitus,
diagnosed at age 6 years. Her glycaemic control had been erratic when she first moved
to university 4 years ago, however she now feels more in control of her glucose levels
with careful titration of her insulin.
Examination
There are bilateral skin lesions affecting her anterior shins. The individual lesions are
discrete and well demarcated with irregular borders. There is atrophy of the dermis and
epidermis resulting in a shiny (but ‘transparent’) surface with yellow colour and apparent arborizing telangiectasia (Fig. 44.1). A full examination including fundoscopy was
otherwise unremarkable. She has no skin lesions elsewhere.

Figure 44.1
97

ANSWER 44
This patient has a history of poor glycaemic control and evidence of diabetic nephropathy. Her current HbA1c value is acceptable but could be tighter. These skin lesions are
called necrobiosis lipoidica (NL), which is associated with diabetes mellitus, particularly
type 1. The frequency of diabetes mellitus amongst patients with NL ranges from 10 to
70 per cent in various studies, and the prevalence of NL amongst patients with diabetes
mellitus ranges from 0.3 to 3.0 per cent. The association with poor glycaemic control is
controversial. However, exercise and improved glycaemic control are reported to improve
the lesions. The lesions initially present as red/brown papules and nodules which may
resemble granuloma annulare or cutaneous sarcoid. They gradually flatten and become
atrophic, taking on the characteristic appearance seen in Figure 44.1. NL has a predilection for the anterior shins, but may also occur elsewhere on the lower legs and feet.
Although the clinical course may be indolent, NL lesions can be associated with refractory ulceration. The clinical appearance and lack of spontaneous remission often prompts
therapeutic intervention. Treatment of NL can be disappointing. Once established the
hallmark of these lesions is atrophy and few therapeutic interventions improve their
appearance. Early application of topical glucocorticoids may slow progression. Some
authors advocate intralesional glucocorticoid injections, but these carry an associated risk
of ulceration. Other treatment modalities described include phototherapy with psoralen–
UVA and even aspirin. Ulcerated NL is managed with dressings and immunosuppressive
therapy (ciclosporin, methotrexate and systemic glucocorticoids).

CASE 45:

SLOWLY PROGRESSIVE SWELLING AND
DISCOLOURATION OVER THE SHINS

History
A 51-year-old man presents to his GP with progressive swelling of the lower legs. He
works as a teacher and had initially ignored the changes, assuming they resulted from
standing all day. However, the swelling did not recede overnight and his shins were
becoming ‘lumpy’. He feels otherwise well in himself, reporting plenty of ‘energy’ in the
classroom, although he has lost weight recently which he can’t explain. There is a family
history of varicose veins and diabetes. He takes occasional paracetamol for headaches
and ‘tired eyes’ at the end of the day.
Examination
There are bilateral pigmented plaques of the anterior shins, worse on the left than the
right, and the associated swelling does not pit on firm pressure (Fig. 45.1). There is no
evidence of varicose veins. He has mild proptosis and clubbing, and is of slim build. There
is no obvious swelling in his neck. His scalp and nails are normal.
Questions
• What investigations would you request?
• What is the diagnosis?
• How would you manage this patient?

Figure 45.1

99

ANSWER 45
One of the many exciting aspects of dermatology is the ability of the trained eye to observe
a cutaneous sign and diagnose a systemic disease – this is one such case. The cutaneous
findings of pretibial myxoedema (thyroid dermopathy) point to an underlying thyroid
disorder most commonly that of autoimmune Graves’s thyrotoxicosis. Pretibial myxoedema may also be seen in Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, and primary hypo-/euthyroidism. The
exact pathogenesis of the skin changes is yet to be delineated, however it is thought that
through an antibody-mediated process skin fibroblasts are stimulated to produce excessive
quantities of glycosaminoglycans, which leads to deposition of hyaluronic acid in the skin.
Classically, the development of pretibial myxoedema is insidious with the development
of non-pitting oedema over the anterior and lateral shins. Chronic oedema leads to firm
indurated pigmented plaque-like areas which may become slightly tender. Skin changes
usually follow eye disease and the diagnosis of thyroid disease, however skin changes
may be the first sign. Many patients with pretibial myxoedema have thyroid eye disease
with proptosis, lid retraction and periorbital oedema. Thyroid acropachy (clubbing) is
common in patients with pretibial myxoedema, and onycholysis of the 4th and 5th fingernails may also occur.
Investigations should include thyroid function tests, which usually show very high levels
of free thyroxins T4 and T3, and low levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone. Thyrotropin
receptor and antithyroglobulin antibodies are usually positive. Skin biopsy is not usually
recommended, as healing of the biopsy site may be poor leading to chronic ulceration.
Treatment of pretibial myxoedema is unsatisfactory. Topical or intra-lesional corticosteroids and compression stockings can help to improve the appearance, lessen discomfort
and prevent possible ulceration. Trials of intra-lesional octreotide have had mixed success
at reducing the levels of hyaluronic acid in the affected skin. Surgery should be avoided
as healing is usually poor.
Radioactive iodine is still considered the first-line treatment for Graves’s disease with
subsequent thyroid replacement necessary in a proportion of patients commencing
approximately two months following thyroid gland destruction. For severe Graves’s disease ophthalmopathy, high-dose corticosteroids may be required or even orbital decompression surgery.
KEY POINTS

• Pretibial myxoedema occurs in about 15 per cent of patients with underlying thyrotoxic
Graves’s disease.

• Deposition of hyaluronic acid in the skin leads to oedematous plaques of the shins.
• Pretibial myxoedema is difficult to manage, however compression and topical steroids
may help.

CASE 46:

ASYMPTOMATIC ANNULAR LESIONS ON THE LIMBS

History
A 56-year-old man presents to the dermatology out-patient clinic with a 2-year history
of an asymptomatic eruption on his limbs. Lesions initially appeared on the dorsi of his
hands, but over the past two years they have also appeared on his elbows and ankles. He
is otherwise well.
Examination
He has an erythematous eruption consisting of grouped lesions on his hands, elbows and
ankles. On the dorsi of his hands the lesions consist of discrete annular and polycyclic
lesions with a raised erythematous edge and central clearing (Fig. 46.1). On palpation
the lesions are indurated (firm thickening of the dermis) with no surface change such as
xerosis or scaling (normal epidermis).
INVESTIGATIONS
A skin biopsy was taken. Serum glucose was determined.

Figure 46.1

Questions
• What is the diagnosis?
• What is the underlying pathophysiology?
• What are the options for treatment?

101

ANSWER 46
This man has a cutaneous eruption consistent with the diagnosis of granuloma annulare
(GA). This is a relatively common skin eruption that can occur at any age. The asymptomatic lesions characteristically appear symmetrically on the dorsi of the hands and feet
and over the flexor surfaces of the wrists and ankles. The onset of the lesions is usually
insidious.
The morphology of GA is variable but characteristically there are multiple, grouped,
small-diameter, annular erythematous lesions with a raised discrete edge. The centre of
the lesions is usually mildly hyperpigmented compared with the surrounding normal skin.
Papules, nodules and plaques may also be seen. The skin lesions feel firm on palpation.
Disseminated GA is a rare variant of the disease characterized by multiple papules on the
trunk and limbs.
There is an increased incidence of GA in association with type 1 diabetes; therefore, testing of fasting blood glucose may be indicated if patients have any systemic symptoms.
The cause of GA remains unknown. Histopathology from affected skin is characterized by
areas of degenerative collagen fibres surrounded by palisading granulomas and reactive
giant cells. A granulomatous pathology has led to speculation of an infective aetiology.
Treatment of GA is often unsatisfactory, however the eruption can resolve spontaneously. Lesions can demonstrate a reverse Koebner’s phenomenon, whereby they resolve
following damage though a skin biopsy or cryotherapy. Superpotent topical steroids with/
without occlusion for a few weeks may help lesions to disappear more quickly. For problematic lesions over joints intra-lesional triamcinolone can be helpful. There are numerous case reports of other successful treatments including psoralen–UVA, photodynamic
therapy, antibiotics, oral prednisolone and ciclosporin.
KEY POINTS

• Granuloma annulare is an asymptomatic eruption of unknown aetiology.
• Lesions are grouped characteristically over the dorsi of the hands and feet.
• The eruption usually resolves spontaneously, however treatment can be attempted to
speed resolution.

AN ASYMPTOMATIC PAPULAR AND ANNULAR
ERUPTION

History
A 34-year-old man presents to the dermatology clinic with multiple skin lesions on his
limbs, which are asymptomatic and have increased in number over one year. He is otherwise well. On direct questioning he admits to shortness of breath whilst playing football.
Examination
He has multiple papules, nodules and annular lesions that are mainly scattered over his
limbs (Fig. 47.1). These range in colour from tan/brown to purple. The skin overlying the
lesions is slightly shiny and taut. On palpation of the lesions there is neither surface scale
or textural change at the surface (epidermis normal), however there is marked induration
(a firmness felt in the underlying tissue) indicating dermal pathology. The lesions are
non-tender and skin temperature was normal. His temperature is 37 oC, blood pressure
124/87 mmHg, pulse 72 /min and oxygen saturation on air is 96%.

Questions
• What tests would you request to help confirm your diagnosis?
• What is your approach to this patient’s management?
103

ANSWER 47
This man has cutaneous and respiratory sarcoidosis. Skin lesions are classically asymptomatic and firm to touch. The involved skin is usually brown or slightly purplish in colour.
Papules, nodules, plaques and annular lesions are often seen. However, some patients
may present with just a few flesh-coloured nodules on the face, or purple infiltrated nasal
skin (lupus pernio). Some patients may have signs of erythema nodosum (tender nodules
on the anterior shins), which results from an underlying panniculitis (inflammation of
fat). Approximately 30 per cent of patients with sarcoidosis have cutaneous involvement.
Patients may have palpable lymphadenopathy or evidence of ‘bulky hilar’ on their chest
X-ray. Formal lung function tests should be conducted in patients with respiratory
symptoms and/or an abnormal chest X-ray. A skin biopsy from involved skin should
be performed to help confirm the diagnosis. The histology classically demonstrates noncaseating ‘naked granulomas’ within the dermis. The aetiology of sarcoidosis is unknown
but is hypothesized to be caused by a persistent antigen of mild virulence leading to
chronic T-cell activation and granuloma formation.
Sarcoidosis is frequently managed by a multidisciplinary team, according to which
organs are affected. If patients have solely cutaneous involvement, then lesions can be
managed with superpotent topical or intra-lesional steroids, oral prednisolone, hydroxychloroquine or low-dose methotrexate.
This patient has significant respiratory as well as cutaneous involvement of his sarcoidosis, therefore a systemic approach to his management is indicated. A short course of
tapering oral prednisolone (20–40 mg daily) may be commenced initially before switching to steroid-sparing low-dose methotrexate weekly for disease control.

KEY POINTS

• Cutaneous sarcoid can have a very heterogeneous appearance.
• Cutaneous lesions may signify underlying systemic disease, so always order a systems
review.

• In multisystem disease the skin is often the most accessible organ for a histological diagnosis.

CASE 48:

ULCER OVER THE GAITER AREA ON A BACKGROUND
OF ACHING LEGS

History
A 73-year-old retired dinner lady presents with a 4-week history of a non-healing area
on her right leg following trauma from a shopping trolley. She tells you that she has
‘suffered from her legs’ for many years now, complaining of long-standing swelling, aching and itching of her lower legs, particularly towards the end of the day. She is a nonsmoker. She has six children. She mentions that her own mother had leg ulcers which
never healed. Her only medication is bendroflumethiazide 2.5 mg/day.
Examination
She is overweight (height 1.55 m, weight 78 kg), her blood pressure is 130/70 mmHg, and
urine dipstick is negative. There is an irregularly shaped ulcer over the medial malleolus
on the right leg (Fig. 48.1). It measures 6.5  4 cm at maximum diameter. The surface
of the ulcer has some clean adherent slough and the base shows evidence of granulation
tissue, the edges of the ulcer are sloping. The surrounding skin is red-brown colour, it is
noticeably shiny and feels tight. Her dorsalis pedis pulses are easily palpable bilaterally.
The remainder of her examination is unremarkable.
Questions
• What is the diagnosis?
• What risk factors does the patient have
for this condition?
• How should she be investigated and
managed?

Figure 48.1

105

ANSWER 48
This clinical presentation would fit best with venous ulcer disease. Venous ulcers are
classically found in the gaiter area and may, as in this case, occur on the background
of chronic venous dermatitis with consequent lipodermatosclerosis. Lipodermatosclerosis
refers to the fibrosis of subcutaneous adipose tissues and is usually accompanied by
haemosiderin deposition, erythema, pruritus and trophic changes of the skin. Its presence
further impairs wound healing. There may be varicosities and oedema. Preceding venous
hypertension may be associated with rather non-specific symptoms.

!

Risk factors for venous ulcer disease

•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Advancing age
Male sex (male to female ratio 1.5–10 : 1)
History of deep vein thrombosis
History of phlebitis
Trauma to legs
Congestive cardiac failure
Family history of venous ulcers
Obesity
Higher number of pregnancies
Occupation involving prolonged standing

In general the diagnosis of venous ulcer disease is a clinical one based on clinical findings
and demonstration of adequate pedal pulses to rule out an element of arterial insufficiency.
Where secondary infection is suspected, microbiology swabs should be obtained. A recent
expert consensus paper suggests that all patients with venous ulcer should undergo duplex
ultrasonography to confirm or exclude venous dysfunction and identify whether the
problem is caused by anatomical obstruction, reflux, or both. It is also standard practice
to document ankle/brachial index prior to application of compression.
The goals of management are to control symptoms, promote healing and prevent recurrence. A non-surgical approach remains the primary treatment. Bed-rest and elevation is
effective but for most impractical, and compression is the ‘gold standard’. Compression
garments or dressings can be painful and are frequently itchy. The mean time to ulcer
healing, even with strict adherence to treatment, is in excess of five months. Surgical
intervention to address perforator vein incompetence does not seem to alter outcome but
may help to prevent recurrence; there is no effective surgical intervention to address deep
venous insufficiency. There are no drugs that promote healing and, in particular, routine
use of systemic antibiotics is not indicated.
KEY POINTS

• Venous disease is the most common cause of leg ulcers.
• Symptoms of venous hypertension include aching, a sense of swelling or heaviness,
•

106

cramps, itch, tingling and restlessness, often worse at the end of the day or after
prolonged standing.
In addition to ulceration at the gaiter area, signs of venous hypertension include
varicosities, broken reticulate capillaries, oedema, hyperpigmentation associated with
haemosiderin deposition, erythema, loss of hair, or thickened trophic nail changes and
ultimately lipodermatosclerosis.

CASE 49:

SLOW-ONSET, UNILATERAL, PAINLESS LEG SWELLING

History
A 33-year-old woman attends the dermatology clinic with
a 9-month history of unilateral leg swelling. Although
the swelling is a cause of significant cosmetic concern, it
is fairly asymptomatic. She is otherwise fit and well. She
has travelled within France, Sweden and North America
over the last 10 years but never visited the tropics. She is
not taking any medication. There is no family history of
similar swelling or varicose veins.
Examination
There is unilateral swelling of the entire left leg, including
toes and extending to the groin. There is no involvement
of the skin above the inguinal ligament. The oedema is
non-pitting and non-tender. Over the distal anterior shin,
the skin is erythematous, with evidence of early verrucous
or cobble-stone change (Fig. 49.1), but there is no crusting, oozing or ulceration. There are no palpable lymph
nodes. Examination of her cardiorespiratory system, abdomen and pelvis was normal.

Questions
• What is the diagnosis?
• What are the potential causes?
• How would you investigate this patient further?
107

ANSWER 49
The diagnosis in this patient is unilateral lymphoedema. Differential diagnoses would
include deep venous thrombosis (DVT) (although one would anticipate more symptoms
and a degree of pitting were that the case) and lipoedema (usually painful and symmetrically bilateral, rarely involving the feet or ankles, but occurring in young adult females).
Lymphatics are essential for clearing extravascular fluid and debris and for the transport
of immunocompetent cells during the initiation of an immune response. Lymphoedema is
an accumulation of protein-rich (1-5.5 g/mL) interstitial fluid due to impaired functioning of the lymphatic channels. This high protein concentration favours the accumulation
of water within the interstitium. This protein and fluid accumulation initiates a marked
inflammatory reaction. Macrophage activity is increased, resulting in destruction of elastic fibers and production of fibrosclerotic tissue. Fibroblasts migrate into the interstitium
and deposit collagen. The result of this inflammatory reaction is a change from the initial
pitting oedema to the brawny non-pitting oedema that is characteristic of lymphoedema.
Consequently, local immunologic surveillance is suppressed, and chronic infections, as
well as malignant degeneration to lymphangiosarcoma, may occur.
Lymphoedema can be primary or secondary. The primary causes are abnormalities in
the lymphatic system that are present at birth, although not always clinically evident
until later in life. The causes of secondary lymphoedema include (1) infections, such as
recurrent lymphangitis or cellulitis, or worldwide the most common cause, filariasis (the
direct infestation of lymph nodes by the parasite Wuchereria bancrofti), (2) malignancy,
(3) obesity, and (4) scarring following trauma or surgery.
Further investigations should be undertaken to rule out occult malignancy and underlying
infection (such as full blood count, CRP and ESR, renal and liver function, tumour markers, abdominal and pelvic imaging studies). Lymphoscintigraphy can be used to assess
the lymphatic system: it allows for detailed visualization of the lymphatic channels with
minimal risk. The anatomy and the obstructed areas of lymphatic flow can be assessed.
Ultrasonography can be used to evaluate the lymphatic and venous systems. Volumetric
and structural changes are identified within the lymphatic system. Venous abnormalities
such as DVT can be excluded based on ultrasonography findings. Lymphangiography,
although once considered the ‘gold standard’ investigation of lymphatic obstruction, is
now rarely performed because of potential adverse effects.
In this case no evidence of occult malignancy was detected on physical examination or
following bloods tests and imaging studies. The diagnosis therefore would be of a primary
lymphoedema.
Primary lymphoedema has been subdivided into three entities: congenital lymphoedema,
lymphoedema praecox, and lymphoedema tarda, depending on age at presentation.
These conditions may be sporadic, with no family history, and usually involve the lower
extremity almost exclusively. All are thought to result from a (usually localized) developmental abnormality of the lymphatic system, which may only become apparent after
a triggering event in later life. Overall women are more commonly affected than men.
The management of lymphoedema is lifelong and is often onerous for the patient; it
requires a high degree of compliance to prevent long-term complications. The principles
of treatment are to eliminate protein stagnation and restore normal lymphatic circulation. Meticulous hygiene is essential as well as the avoidance of trauma, and a pragmatic
approach to weight reduction. Long-term prophylactic antimicrobial treatment might be
108

considered for patients with recurrent cellulitis or lymphangitis. A compression garment
should be worn during the day with elevation of the affected limb overnight. Intermittent
pneumatic pump compression therapy may also be instituted on an out-patient basis or
in the home.

Complications and treatment of lymphoedema
Complications

• Functional effects of swelling – fatigue, embarrassment, difficulty with clothing
• Inflammatory effect of accumulated protein-rich fluid, leading to dermatitis
• Increased infection risk – recurrent fungal (e.g. tinea pedis) and bacterial

CASE 50:

AN INFIRM ELDERLY MAN WITH ARTERIAL DISEASE
AND AN ULCERATED HEEL

History
You are asked to review a painful skin wound on the right heel of an 82-year-old man
who is currently convalescing at a residential care home. He has been a resident of the
home following a cerebrovascular accident two months ago and although he is showing signs of neurological recovery his mobility is limited by osteoarthritis of the hips
and knees. He had coronary artery bypass grafting 8 years ago. He is an ex-smoker. His
medications are aspirin 75 mg, atorvastatin 10 mg, lisinopril 10 mg and nifedipine 20 mg
daily, as well as codeine and paracetamol prn for pain relief, and a prescription for prn
haloperidol 1.5 mg.
Examination
He is a frail man with limited mobility during the examination. His blood pressure is
120/80 mmHg. He has a left-sided upper motor neurone weakness. He has a well-defined
area of ulceration over the medial aspect of his left heel (Fig. 50.1). The ulcer is ‘punched
out’ with a dry necrotic eschar overlying the base, the surrounding skin is erythematous.
On examination of the arterial system of his legs, the femoral pulses are present but
popliteal, posterior tibial and dorsalis pedis pulses are reduced on the left compared with
the right. He has normal sensation in his feet. Ankle/brachial indices are measured and
demonstrate an ankle pressure of 60 mmHg on the left and 80 mmHg on the right.
Questions
• What is the diagnosis?
• What are the likely factors in the
aetiology of this ulcer?
• What is the optimum management?

Figure 50.1

111

ANSWER 50
The diagnosis in this patient is pressure or decubitus ulcer. The ulcer is located over a
bony prominence. The history and examination showed that he has arterial disease, and
ischaemia leading to tissue necrosis will be an important factor; however an ankle pressure of  50 mmHg is not considered to represent critical ischaemia. The presence of
arterial disease is a poor prognostic feature.
Other contributing factors will be his age and his neurological impairment (particularly
the combination of spasticity and paralysis) and reduced mobility due to arthritis. The
appropriateness of the prescription for haloperidol should be considered, as excessive
sedation will contribute to impaired sensory perception. Other factors to consider are
malnutrition, anaemia and incontinence. The aetiology of decubitus ulcers is generally a
combination of pressure over bony prominences, shearing forces, destruction of the skin
and compromised blood flow.
The prevention and care of chronic lower leg ulceration places a significant burden on
patients and the health care system. Non-healing ulcers place the patient at risk for lower
extremity amputation. Pressure relief is essential to the management of pressure ulcers
using repositioning schedules and specialized beds. Management of incontinence to prevent contamination as well as wound cleaning and appropriate dressing are important to
encourage healing and prevent bacterial secondary infection. Necrotic tissue may require
surgical debridement. Measures to address immobility and spasticity, nutritional status
and lower limb perfusion should be considered.

!

Staging of pressure ulcers

• Stage I – no tissue loss, non-blanching erythema
• Stage II – superficial, partial-thickness ulcer with skin breakdown and minimal
tissue necrosis

• Stage III – full-thickness ulcer displaying breakdown extending through the
dermis and exposing subcutaneous tissue

• Stage IV – extends through the deep fascia, damaging underlying muscle and bone

KEY POINTS

• Decubitus ulcers remain a significant cause of morbidity despite advances in their
prevention, as well as active medical, surgical and nursing management.

• They particularly affect elderly persons with impaired sensation, prolonged immobility
and other complex co-morbidities.

• Recognition and remediation of risk factors and, in particular, pressure relief are crucial
to their prevention.

CASE 51:

NON-HEALING FOOT ULCER IN A DIABETIC PATIENT

History
A 63-year-old man presents to the dermatology out-patient clinic complaining of a
non-healing ulcer on his right foot. He has had poorly controlled type 2 diabetes for
22 years. Four years ago his right big toe was amputated because of ulceration and infection. Following that procedure his compliance with medication improved and he stopped
smoking. He attends many different hospital appointments monthly and struggles with
his weight because of chronic back pain and impaired vision. His medication includes
metformin, glicazide, ramipril, amlodipine, aspirin and simvastatin.
Examination
The patient is 1.85 m tall, weighs 104 kg and his blood pressure is 154/88 mmHg. He
has a painless round ulcer overlying the right third metatarsal head, the base of which
is covered with purulent slough. The ulcer is surrounded by callus formation with erythema and swelling extending medially and overlying the second metatarsal (Fig. 51.1).
There is no tissue crepitus but some scaliness of the surrounding plantar skin. There is
onychodystrophy suggestive of onychomycosis affecting four of his nine toenails. He has
reduced posterior tibial artery pulses bilaterally and absent dorsalis pedis pulse on the
right. Ankle reflexes cannot be elicited. He is unable to sense 10-g monofilament pressure over the medial aspect of the distal third of his right foot; vibration, fine touch and
pin-prick sensation are also absent. Furthermore these modalities are reduced at both feet
from approximately the ankle level.

114

This page intentionally left blank

ANSWER 51
Foot ulcers affect 15–25 per cent of patients with diabetes. This patient’s peripheral neuropathy is likely to be the direct cause of an ulcer at this site. His elevated blood sugar,
peripheral vascular disease and possible ulcer infection contribute to poor healing.
Callus formation often precedes ulceration and in this case reflects abnormal pressure
distribution as a result of amputation and neuropathy. Diabetic foot ulcers occur typically
over bony prominences of the feet, especially the big toe, or the plantar skin overlying
the 1st or 2nd metatarsal heads. Complications of foot ulcers include soft tissue infection
(cellulitis, fasciitis) and osteomyelitis. Lower extremity ulcers are a significant factor in
amputations amongst diabetics.
Additional bedside tests would include urine dipstick – looking for proteinuria, in particular – and lying and standing blood pressure, as the patient may be describing postural
hypotension, a symptom of autonomic neuropathy. A scraping of the scaly areas can
be taken to look for tinea pedis and the ulcer should be swabbed for bacterial culture.
Blood glucose monitoring may not be informative as it reflects only short-term control.
It would, however, be important to check HbA1C level.
The management of diabetic foot ulcers requires modification of factors that contribute to
ulcer formation, for example, management of infection and glycaemic control. Standard
therapy includes debridement, off-loading and protective dressings. Regular review and
inspection of the ulcer is important.
Ulcer prevention is one of the most important interventions medical professionals can
provide for diabetic patients. Optimizing glycaemic control and patient education are
crucial to ulcer prevention.

Risk factors for the development of foot ulcers in diabetics

• Poor glycaemic control (there is a direct correlation between HbA1C level and

•
•
•
•

incidence of foot ulceration)
Previous foot ulceration ( 50% will re-ulcerate within 3 years)
Prior lower limb amputation
Duration of diabetes ( 10 years)
Impaired visual acuity (reflecting microvascular disease)
Onychomycosis

KEY POINTS

• Diabetic ulcers occur over bony prominences often within an area of callus formation.
• Poor glycaemic control, neuropathy and microvascular disease (with or without
peripheral vascular disease) are important risk factors.

• Education and support from a multidisciplinary team are important.
• General foot care guidelines for patients with diabetes: daily washing of feet with
lukewarm water and careful attention to drying; choice of appropriate footwear (always
wear shoes and socks); daily inspection and palpation inside shoes to check for foreign
objects or rough surfaces; seeking rapid professional attention for calluses, blisters, cuts,
rash or ingrown toe-nails, etc.

CASE 52:

A REGRESSING VASCULAR LESION IN A
PRE-SCHOOL CHILD

History
A 3-year-old girl attends the paediatric dermatology clinic with her mother. She has a
red lesion on her left ear, which her mother fears will lead to bullying in school. The
lesion is entirely asymptomatic. Her parents first noticed the lesion shortly after birth and
describe it as having the appearance of a red ‘stain’. Shortly before her six-week check it
was beginning to enlarge and it grew until she was approximately four months old. Her
mother feels it has been fairly static subsequently. The child is otherwise well; she was
born at term and is fully vaccinated to date. There is no family history of birthmarks or
other skin lesions.
Examination
She is thriving with height and weight between the 50th and 75th centiles for her age.
She has an elevated, dome-shaped, dusky red, rubbery, non-tender lesion on the dorsal
aspect of the lobule of her left ear (Fig. 52.1). The overlying skin is showing some patchy
pallor (or greying). She has no other skin lesions.
Questions
• What is this lesion?
• What is its natural history?
• What management options
available?

are

Figure 52.1

117

ANSWER 52
This lesion is an infantile haemangioma, also referred to as a capillary haemangioma,
strawberry naevus or cavernous haemangioma. These are benign vascular neoplasms
and are the most common tumours of infancy. Most infantile haemangiomas are medically insignificant and the vast majority of lesions (80 per cent) are focal and solitary.
Occasionally, however, they can impinge on vital structures, ulcerate, bleed, become
secondarily infected or painful; also they can cause high-output cardiac failure or significant structural abnormalities or disfigurement. Visual obstruction, airway obstruction or
interference with feeding/defaecation are the most commonly encountered complications.
Haemangiomas can also occur in extracutaneous sites such as larynx, gastrointestinal
tract and other abdominal viscera. Rarely, they may be associated with more extensive
underlying congenital anomalies (e.g. PHACE syndrome, posterior fossa brain abnormalities, haemangiomas, arterial lesions, cardiac anomalies and eye abnormalities).
Infantile haemangiomas follow a characteristic course, with an early rapid-proliferation
phase during the neonatal period or early infancy, followed by a slow gradual involution
phase up to the age of approximately 10 years. Early features include blanching of the
affected skin, fine telangiectases, or a red macule or papule. As they proliferate, depending on their size and depth, their appearance may combine one or more features such
as dome-shaped, lobulated, plaque-like, and tumoural. Most reach a maximum size of
about 5 cm, but they can range from a pin-head to more than 20 cm in diameter. During
the involution phase it is common for the haemangioma to shrink centrifugally from the
centre; they become less red and gradually duskier (greying) before becoming softer and
regaining flesh tones. The involution phase will be completed by 9 years of age in the
overwhelming majority of patients, and for approximately 70 per cent of patients the
haemangioma resolves completely. In the remainder there may be some residual permanent changes such as telangiectasia, superficial dilated vessels, stippled scarring, epidermal atrophy, hypopigmentation and/or redundant skin with fibrofatty residua.
The majority of infantile haemangiomas, such as the case presented, do not require any
medical or surgical intervention. Treatment is indicated to reduce morbidity and mortality
and to prevent complications which may have an impact on growth and development.
In general the cosmetic aspect of haemangiomas is dealt with following the involution
phase. Laser therapy is beneficial in treating ulcerated haemangiomas and thin superficial
lesions in cosmetically sensitive sites. Surgical excision is exceptionally rare because of
the potential intra-operative hazards and longer-term cosmetic results. Medical treatment
with systemic or intra-lesional corticosteroids can be effective at slowing the growth and
decreasing the size of proliferating haemangiomas. Propranolol is also emerging as a
potentially more effective therapy during the proliferation phase, and has been in use for
the management of severe or disfiguring haemangiomas since 2008. Duration of therapy
varies from 2 to 10 months and there are currently no universally accepted criteria for
initiation of therapy or therapeutic protocols. Propranolol, however, is very likely to make
the use of agents such as interferon- and vincristine obsolete in the management of
haemangiomas.
In the case presented it is essential to educate the parents about the natural history and
prognosis of infantile haemangiomas, as well as the potential risks and benefits of different treatments. Emotional support and exchange of views are available through forums
such as the Birthmark Society. However, there would be little indication for intervention
at this stage.

118

KEY POINTS

• Infantile haemangiomas are the most common tumour of infancy.
• These benign endothelial neoplasms are typically absent at birth, they characteristically
grow rapidly in infancy and gradually spontaneously involute over the first decade.

• The majority of haemangiomas require no treatment; however, if there are associated
complications such as visual or airway obstruction, ulceration or bleeding, different
treatments are available under close hospital supervision.

CASE 53:

A LIVID RED BIRTHMARK ON A NEWBORN CHILD

History
A 7-week-old baby boy attends the paediatric dermatology clinic with his mother for
follow-up of an extensive red patch. He was born at 38 weeks by elective caesarean section for transverse-lie, following an uneventful pregnancy. He has one sister. There is
no family history of similar skin lesions. The red patch was noted at birth, and he was
reviewed on a daily basis both by the dermatology department and by the neonatal team.
No other problems presented prior to discharge on day 5. In particular, his height and
weight were both on the 50th centile, he was feeding well, passing urine and meconium.
A full blood count was performed prior to discharge and was normal, as was an ultrasound scan of his abdomen, pelvis, spine and head. Since discharge he has continued
to thrive, feeding from both breast and bottle. His mother has had contact with health
visitors and dermatology specialist nurses and despite considerable initial anxiety is now
calm and feels she is coping well.
Examination
His weight is now between the 50th and 75th centiles, with height and head circumference remaining on the 50th centile. He has an extensive, flat (macular), well-defined
dusky red patch, which extends from the sole of his left foot along the posterolateral
aspect of his leg to involve his entire left buttock and lumbosacral region (Fig. 53.1).
He has a similar discrete patch on the left side of his upper abdomen, which extends
posteriorly to the midline. Additionally he has a blue-grey macule over his right lumbosacral area (a Mongolian blue spot). His observations are stable and examination of
his cardiovascular, respiratory, abdominal systems and genitalia was normal. A detailed
neurological examination revealed no concerns, his anterior fontanelle is level and he has
a social smile. There is symmetry of all limbs.

Questions
• What are these patches?
• What complications can be associated with them?
• How should this child and his family be managed?

121

ANSWER 53
These lesions are capillary malformations or port wine stains. They represent congenital
malformation of superficial dermal blood vessels as a result of abnormal morphogenesis.
In the past, the nomenclature of these lesions has led to confusion and difficulty in differentiating vascular malformations from vascular proliferative lesions such as infantile
haemangiomas. Capillary malformations are almost always present at birth (although
not always detected because of neonatal plethora) and grow with the child; they remain
present for life but may show tendency to colour change (either fading or more commonly becoming a deeper purple). The surface can develop a cobblestone contour or
nodularity in adulthood.
Thorough assessment of patients with capillary malformations for associated complications is important. Capillary malformations can occur with other vascular malformations
(venous, lymphatic, arterial or mixed). Ocular and/or central nervous system involvement
occurs in approximately 10 per cent of patients with facial capillary malformations. In
particular, involvement of the distribution of the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal
nerve is associated with leptomeningeal involvement (Sturge–Weber syndrome), with
risk of glaucoma, seizures, developmental defects, subdural haemorrhages and hemiplegia. All patients with upper facial capillary malformations should have ophthalmological
assessment (and magnetic resonance imaging of the brain if Sturge–Weber syndrome is
suspected). Klippel–Trenaunay syndrome (angio-osteohypertrophy syndrome) is a triad of
capillary malformation, congenital venous malformation and hypertrophy of the underlying tissues including muscle and bone. A capillary malformation overlying the spine may
be associated with vascular malformations in the subjacent spinal meninges or occult spinal dysraphism. The coexistence of the capillary malformation and Mongolian blue spot in
this case may be coincidental, however the literature suggests the risk of spinal structural
or vascular anomalies is higher in the presence of another lumbosacral cutaneous anomaly.
Isolated capillary malformations are not associated with significant medical complications; however, psychosocial disability secondary to disfigurement can be overwhelming.
In the neonatal period such obvious and visible differences will inevitably be a source of
anxiety for parents and it is crucial that the parents of this baby are offered sympathetic
explanations, education and reassurance as well as the opportunity for them to discuss
their concerns. They may benefit from peer support through patient support networks.
This child will require long-term follow-up; if associated complications such as limb
length discrepancy arise, he will benefit from the care of a multidisciplinary team
including dermatology, orthopaedics, interventional radiology, plastic surgery, as well as
occupational therapy, physiotherapy, and psychology. The treatment of choice for capillary malformations is pulsed-dye laser, which causes selective destruction of superficial
abnormally dilated dermal bloods vessels, by inducing coagulation and rupture. The cosmetic outcome is variable, with larger lesions over limbs responding less well and tending
to recur, compared to smaller lesions over the head and neck.
KEY POINTS

• Capillary malformations are congenital malformations of superficial dermal vessels,
which are present at birth and grow with the child.

• They can be associated with other vascular malformations or structural anomalies.
• Isolated capillary malformations can be a source of significant psychosocial morbidity
for new parents as well as for the affected individual.

CASE 54:

SLOW DEVELOPMENT OF A SCALY PLAQUE
ON A FINGER

History
A 74-year-old woman presents with a 1-year history of a lesion on the dorsum of
her middle finger. This has gradually increased in size over the last 12 months and is
asymptomatic. Previously she had a similar lesion on her left leg, which had been treated
successfully 18 months ago. She lived abroad as a child and is a keen gardener. She is
otherwise well and takes 75 mg aspirin daily.
Examination
There is an erythematous plaque 1 cm in size with overlying scale on the dorsum of her
middle finger, the surrounding skin being normal (Fig. 54.1).
Questions
• What are the differential diagnoses?
• How would you confirm the diagnosis?
• What are the options for treatment?

Figure 54.1

123

ANSWER 54
This elderly patient has had significant sun exposure in childhood and now enjoys outdoor activities. The lesion is on a sun-exposed site and has grown slowly. The diagnosis
is Bowen’s disease – squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) in situ. She has had a similar lesion
previously. The history of a solitary erythematous plaque with overlying scale on the
dorsum of the finger led to a suspicion of Bowen’s disease, which was confirmed by taking a biopsy for histopathological analysis.
Bowen’s disease appears as a sharply, demarcated, erythematous, patch or plaque with
overlying hyperkeratosis. These lesions occur most commonly on the legs of older
woman, but also occur on other sun-exposed sites such as the face, ears and the dorsi of
the hands. Bowen’s disease is a pre-malignant condition, hence the term SCC in situ. A
SCC is a cancer derived from squamous cells. These are cells that make up the epidermis.
In situ means that the malignant cells are confined to the epidermis and have therefore
not invaded deeper. A change in the appearance of Bowen’s disease such as development
of a nodule can indicate progression into an invasive SCC.
Bowen’s disease occurs in aging skin. It may be caused by ultraviolet irradiation or
human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. HPV-induced Bowen’s disease occurs mostly in
the genital sites but may also appear periungally.
Differential diagnoses include discoid eczema, psoriasis, viral warts, seborrhoeic keratoses,
actinic keratoses, superficial basal cell carcinoma and extramammary Paget’s disease.
Histolopathology shows full-thickness change of the epidermis with loss of the normal
maturation keratinocytes.
Treatments include topical chemotherapy with 5-fluorouracil cream and imiquimod.
Cryotherapy with liquid nitrogen is very effective. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) refers
to treatment with a photosensitizer that is applied topically to the affected area prior to
exposing it to a strong source of visible light. Other destructive methods include curettage and cautery.
KEY POINTS

• Bowen’s disease occurs on sun-exposed skin sites in the elderly.
• Patches are well demarcated, erythematous and hyperkeratotic.
• Bowen’s disease is squamous cell carcinoma in situ.

CASE 55:

A SLOW-GROWING ULCERATED NON-HEALING
NODULE ON THE FACE

History
A 59-year-old construction worker presents to the dermatology clinic with a 3-year history of a slow-growing lesion on the left temple. The patient describes that the lesion
had begun as a small ‘spot’, which had gradually enlarged and had more recently been
crusting over and intermittently bleeding. There is no previous history of skin disease
and no family history of similar problems. He has worked outdoors for 40 years and has
travelled abroad to tropical climates twice a year.
Examination
There is a nodular lesion 18 mm in diameter with a translucent edge and overlying telangiectasia with central crust (Fig. 55.1). Full skin examination does not reveal any other
similar lesions, although he is noted as being tanned.
Questions
• What is the clinical diagnosis?
• What investigation should be
performed?
• How should this patient be treated?

Figure 55.1

125

ANSWER 55
Clinically, this man has a basal cell carcinoma (BCC) or rodent ulcer. Malignant skin
tumours are amongst the commonest of all cancers. BCCs are the most common of the
skin cancer group and their incidence is continuing to rise. Most typically they are found
on sun-exposed sites in lighter skinned, middle-aged to elderly individuals, although
owing to changes in lifestyle and increasing travel such patients can present as early as
in the third decade.
There are different clinical and histological types. This patient has a nodular BCC, which
is the most frequently seen and, like this lesion, has well-defined, rolled edges that
have a pearly translucent appearance. On closer examination superficial blood vessels
(telangiectasia) are often seen. As the BCC enlarges it can ulcerate, hence the patient’s
description of recent intermittent bleeding and crusting. Eventually the ulceration can
cause destruction of the underlying tissue. For example, around the nasal area the cartilage can be destroyed and hence the name ‘rodent’ ulcer. This patient’s outdoor occupation and recreational history of travel to areas of high intensity ultraviolet are important.
To confirm the diagnosis a skin biopsy
was performed for histopathological confirmation. Other subtypes include superficial
BCCs, where the lesion is much flatter and
erythematous, often with an overlying surface scale (Fig. 55.2). Morphoeic BCCs are
translucent plaques with an ill-defined edge
(Fig. 55.3).
Although BCCs have a low malignant potential they are locally destructive and can
cause significant morbidity, especially when Figure 55.2
occurring around facial structures such as
the eyes and nose. Treatment is dependent
on site, size and type of BCC. Treatment
options include curettage and cautery, surgical excision, photodynamic therapy and
radiotherapy. For those lesions in high-risk
anatomical sites and for lesions that have
clinically ill-defined margins, such as the
morphoeic BCCs, then Mohs’ micrographic
surgery is the treatment of choice, where the
tissue is sectioned and examined to ensure
that all the tumour has been excised before Figure 55.3
repairing the defect.
Patients should undergo a full skin examination and be given future photoprotective
advice.
KEY POINTS

• Basal cell carcinomas (BCCs) are the most common type of skin cancer.
• Subtypes of BCCs include nodular, superficial and morphoeic.
• Treatment options include curettage and cautery, surgical excision annd radiotherapy.

CASE 56:

MULTIPLE BASAL CELL CARCINOMAS IN A
YOUNG PATIENT

History
A 36-year-old man presents with multiple skin lesions, which have gradually developed
over the last two years. He had been diagnosed with a basal cell carcinoma (BCC) over
his left cheek 10 years previously, and this had been removed. He is otherwise well but
has undergone numerous dental procedures in the past. His father also had multiple BCCs.
Examination
He has multiple erythematous patches with overlying scale on his anterior and posterior
trunk (Fig. 56.1) and three similar lesions on his face. Examination of his hands reveals
sharply marginated, depressed lesions 1-2 mm in diameter (Fig. 56.2).

Figure 56.2

Figure 56.1

Questions
• What is this syndrome?
• What are the other features?
• How should this patient be managed?

127

ANSWER 56
This patient has Gorlin’s syndrome (basal cell naevus syndrome). The history of a previous BCC at such an early age combined with now several likely superficial BCCs, which
appear as erythematous patches with overlying scale, is highly suggestive of the diagnosis. The palmar pits and family history are also relevant.
Gorlin’s syndrome is an autosomal dominant disease caused by a mutation in the patched
(PTCH) gene on chromosome 9q (9q22). This gene normally functions as a tumour suppressor, so when defective it allows basal cell carcinomas to develop. It usually presents
in late childhood, although some features are congenital.
BCCs can occur from early adolescence and continue throughout life. They are more
common on sun-exposed sites, but also occur in unexposed areas and are usually multiple. The most common cutaneous lesions are superficial and nodular BCCs, although
morphoeic BCCs can also occur. Small indentations on the palmar surfaces which are pinpoint to several millimeters across are present in 50 per cent of patients. Developmental
abnormalities include frontal bossing, odontogenic keratocysts (which was the reason
for this patient’s dental procedures), bifid or splayed ribs, scoliosis and kyphosis. Eye
lesions including strabismus can also occur. Ovarian fibromas and teratomas have also
been reported.
Gorlin’s syndrome is an important condition to recognize owing to potential development of literally hundreds of BCCs in one lifetime, which leads to multiple excisions and
considerable scarring. Patients with suspected Gorlin’s syndrome should be referred for
genetic counselling. Life-long photoprotection and follow-up is the mainstay of treatment.
Management of superficial BCCs, which are the main type in these patients, includes
topical therapy with the immunomodulator imiquimod 5% cream. Destructive methods, such as cryotherapy with liquid nitrogen and curettage and cautery, are effective.
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) and surgical excision are also therapeutic options.
KEY POINTS

• Gorlin’s syndrome is an autosomal dominant disease caused by a mutation in the
PTCH gene.

• Patients develop multiple BCCs.
• Other manifestations include palmar pits, frontal bossing and jaw cysts.

CASE 57:

AN ULCERATING LESION ON THE SCALP, ENLARGING
OVER 4 MONTHS

History
An 86-year-old man presents with a bleeding lesion on his scalp. This had slowly
enlarged over a 4-month period and was very painful. He had worked abroad whilst in
the army 50–60 years ago. He had previously had other lesions treated on the scalp with
liquid nitrogen.
Examination
There is a large ulcerated eroded nodule over the vertex of the scalp that is friable, erythematous and with a soft fleshy margin (Fig. 57.1). Over the surrounding skin there are
scattered erythematous patches with overlying scale. There is palpable lymphadenopathy
in the cervical chain.
INVESTIGATIONS
A skin biopsy was performed.

Questions
• What is the likely diagnosis?
• How should this patient be treated?

Figure 57.1

129

ANSWER 57
The likely diagnosis is an invasive squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). This patient, an elderly man, has a friable lesion on a bald scalp, which has developed over four months.
Initially, SCCs begin as ill-defined, erythematous papules or nodules with a hyperkeratotic top (rough surface); as they enlarge they may ulcerate. He had worked in tropical
climates whilst in the armed forces. The palpable cervical nodes suggest that the skin
cancer may have metastasized.
The differential diagnoses would include an amelanotic malignant melanoma, and a
nodular basal cell carcinoma, actinic keratoses, Bowen’s disease and a keratoacanthoma.
Invasive SCC is a malignant tumour of keratinocytes. SCCs often arise in precancerous
lesions in otherwise healthy individuals over the age of 55 years. Men are more commonly affected than women. SCCs usually arise from actinic keratoses and Bowen’s disease. Actinic keratoses are single or multiple erythematous patches with adherent scale
on sun-exposed skin in middle-aged adults.
Histologically, there are different levels of differentiation, which can correlate to the
aggressiveness of the SCC: well, moderately and poorly differentiated. Poorly differentiated lesions do not show signs of keratinization and clinically appear fleshy, friable and
ulcerated as in this case. Metastasis is more common than with well-differentiated lesions.
Predisposing factors include chronic actinic damage, sites of chronic ulceration and scarring, exposure to ionizing radiation and immunosuppression, especially in solid organ
transplant recipients and HIV disease.
Surgical excision is the treatment of choice. Depending on location and size of the lesion,
it may require closure with a skin flap or graft. Mohs’ micrographic surgery may be
required for difficult sites. In elderly patients, SCCs can be treated with radiotherapy if
surgery is not feasible/desirable. SCCs are more aggressive than basal cell carcinomas and
can metastasize. The majority of ultraviolet-induced lesions have a low rate of distant
metastasis. Higher risk SCCs are defined as those on the ear, lip and genitalia. A greater
incidence of metastases occurs in immunosuppressed patients. All patients with SCCs
should have a full skin check to exclude any further suspicious lesions and all lymph
node groups examined to exclude metastases. Suspicious nodes should be biopsied.
KEY POINTS

• Invasive squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is a malignant tumour of keratinocytes.
• SCCs usually arise from actinic keratoses and Bowen’s disease.
• Metastases can spread into the draining lymph nodes and ultimately the blood.

CASE 58:

A RAPIDLY GROWING LESION ON THE DORSUM OF
THE HAND

History
A 59-year-old man presents with a 7-week history of a rapidly growing lesion on the
dorsum of his right hand. He had seen his GP who had referred him to the dermatology
out-patient clinic. However, over the past week the patient had thought that the lesion
was now getting smaller and had wondered about cancelling his appointment. His wife
had insisted that he attend the clinic to put her mind at rest. He is otherwise well and
denies any previous skin problems.
Examination
He has an erythematous, firm, dome-shaped nodule measuring 1.3 cm in diameter with a
central keratin plug (Fig. 58.1). Full skin examination reveals a somewhat sun-damaged
skin with freckling and solar lentigos but nothing else of note.
INVESTIGATIONS
A biopsy was arranged.

Questions
• What is the most likely diagnosis?
• What is the usual course and prognosis
of this lesion?

Figure 58.1

131

ANSWER 58
The diagnosis of keratoacanthoma should always be considered when a patient presents
with a rapidly enlarging nodule with a central crater. These lesions grow rapidly over a
few weeks and are occasionally painful. They typically appear on sun-exposed sites, such
as the face and the dorsal surfaces of the hands. Clinically they appear as dome-shaped
nodules with shouldering that has a central keratin plug. If the plug falls away a crater is
left. Although a keratoacanthoma may mimic a squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) the latter
would not spontaneously regress which can occur with keratoacanthomas over a period
of weeks to months.
Keratoacanthomas are epidermal tumours, which may behave in a benign way and are
therefore called ‘pseudo’ tumours. In some cases there is a preceding history of minor
trauma at the affected site. Previous ultraviolet light exposure appears to be a risk factor,
as does human papilloma virus infections. Histologically, they can be difficult to distinguish from SCCs as they contain cytologically atypical keratinocytes. For this reason they
can usually only be distinguished on clinical grounds.
SCC is a skin cancer that can metastasize early into the blood. Therefore, most dermatologists would excise such nodules to be sure they have always fully eradicated any
potential SCCs. It is not current clinical practice to wait for keratoacanthomas to regress:
they are treated as if they were SCCs.
In the right clinical context, where the suspicion of keratoacanthoma is very high and the
patient deemed unsuitable for a full excision, some keratoacanthomas may be removed
by curettage and cautery (tumour curettage – performed aggressively using three passes)
with satisfactory results. If keratoacanthomas involute spontaneously, then they usually
leave a cosmetically disfiguring residual scar. Hypertrophic actinic keratoses may also be
included in the differential diagnosis.
Finally, a rare genetic disease called Ferguson–Smith syndrome is an autosomal dominant condition where multiple keratoacanthomas develop over the face and extremities.
In Ferguson–Smith syndrome the keratoacanthomas do regress spontaneously but lead
to significant scarring.
KEY POINTS

• Keratoacanthomas manifest as dome-shaped nodules with a central keratin plug.
• Histologically they are difficult to distinguish from SCCs.
• Keratoacanthomas may spontaneously regress.

CASE 59:

A LONGSTANDING FLESH-COLOURED NODULE ON
THE FACE

History
A 49-year-old woman presents with a 20-year history of a nodule on her face, which she
felt had slowly increased in size over the years. She is anxious about the lesion as friends
and neighbours have starting asking her what it is. She feels embarrassed by the lesion
and is keen to have it removed. There is no history of itching or bleeding of the lesion.
She has quite fair skin (Fitzpatrick type II) and has had limited sun exposure.
Examination
She has a dome-shaped, firm, flesh-coloured nodule lateral to her left eye (Fig. 59.1).
There is no surface change felt over the nodule, no telangiectasia and no tenderness. Full
skin examination does not reveal any other lesions of note.
Questions
• What is this lesion?
• Can you classify this lesion on clinical
grounds?
• How would you manage this patient?

Figure 59.1

133

ANSWER 59
This nodule is a benign intradermal naevus, otherwise known as a ‘mole’. A naevus from
the word ‘nest’ is a benign proliferation of cells, as in this case melanocytes. Naevi may be
congenital or acquired and may contain melanocytes, epidermal cells or connective tissue.
Melanocytic naevi are very common and are usually multiple. Naevi may be macular or
papular/nodular, they vary in colour from pink or flesh-coloured to dark brown or black.
Most are round or oval in shape. They are usually  1 cm in diameter and are common
in patients of skin types I–IV and less common in types V and VI.
Melanocytic naevi are classified accordingly to their histology. They are described
according to the site of the naevus cells in the skin (Fig. 59.2).
The naevus cells in melanocytic naevi are thought to be
derived from melanocytes that
migrate to the epidermis during embryonic development
from the neural crest.

Junctional naevus

Compound naevus

Intradermal naevus

Figure 59.2

Melanocytic naevi begin as a proliferation
of cells along the dermo-epidermal junction, forming a junctional naevus. Clinically
these moles tend to be flat and dark brown
(Fig. 59.3). With continued proliferation,
cells extend from the dermo-epidermal junction into the dermis, forming nests of naevus
cells, so-called compound naevus. Clinically
these moles have a centrally raised area and
may be surrounded by flat pigmentation
(Fig. 59.4). Finally, the junctional component of the naevus may resolve leaving
an intradermal naevus, as in this patient.
These moles often protrude from the skin
surface and are flesh-coloured or slightly
pigmented.

Figure 59.3

Acquired melanocytic naevi appear throughout childhood and adolescence reaching
a peak in early adulthood. They may also
appear in later adult life, usually secondary
to excessive ultraviolet light exposure for
the skin type. In the 60th decade onwards
naevi usually gradually involute and many
disappear altogether.
Figure 59.4
This patient should be reassured that her mole is benign. She should be given sun-protection
advice as she has fair skin and is liable to get sunburn in strong sunlight.

134

Acquired moles should be distinguished from congenital melanocytic naevi (CMNs),
which are usually present at birth or appear in the first year of life. Approximately
1 per cent of Caucasians are affected. The lesions are usually  1 cm in diameter and
can become protuberant and hairy in nature with increasing age. CMNs usually grow in
proportion to the child – sudden increase in growth, satellite lesions appearing at the
periphery or nodules forming within them warrant a skin biopsy. The risk of malignant
transformation (melanoma) is thought to be very low but is more often reported in
so-called ‘giant naevi’ which are  20 cm in diameter.

KEY POINTS

• A naevus is a benign proliferation of melanocytes.
• Naevi can be junctional, compound or intradermal.
• Naevi are either congenital or acquired.

CASE 60:

MULTIPLE, SLIGHTLY ATYPICAL LOOKING NAEVI ON
THE TRUNK

History
A 28-year-old woman presents with multiple naevi, which had gradually appeared over
many years, since puberty. She denies any history of obvious change in her moles but
feels she has had too many to keep a proper check on them. She reports that all her family have multiple naevi. Her brother on a routine check had recently been diagnosed with
a malignant melanoma.
Examination
She has multiple naevi over her trunk and limbs, all of which have a similar appearance,
with a slightly irregular border and varying shades of brown, tan and light red (Fig. 60.1).
Questions
• What is this syndrome?
• How would you manage this patient?

Figure 60.1

137

ANSWER 60
This patient was diagnosed with atypical (dysplastic) naevus syndrome. The patient has
multiple atypical naevi, as do her family and a first-degree relative with a malignant
melanoma.
Single atypical naevi are present in 5 per cent of the population. These naevi are usually
larger than the rest of the patient’s moles and clinically have an asymmetrical shape,
irregular border and outline. These moles tend to ‘stand-out from the crowd’. They have a
greater variation in pigmentation than the rest of the patient’s moles. These atypical naevi
tend to occur later in childhood than common, acquired melanocytic naevi. Histologically
these moles show features of mild to severe architectural dysplasia.
Atypical melanocytic naevi occur sporadically or as part of the familial atypical naevus
syndrome (patients with this syndrome may have several hundred atypical naevi) and are
potential precursors for malignant melanoma.
To be diagnosed with the atypical naevus syndrome patients must have:
1. one or more first-degree or second-degree relatives with malignant melanoma;
2. a large number of naevi (often more than 50), some of which are atypical naevi
clinically;
3. histologically dysplastic naevi.
Patients with atypical naevi have a slightly higher risk of developing melanoma than
the general population, particularly if they have five or more. Patients with the atypical
naevus syndrome have a far greater risk of developing melanoma than those with a small
number of atypical moles.
Consequently, patients diagnosed with this syndrome should undergo life-long surveillance due to the potential risk of development of malignant melanoma. Patients are
taught to examine their own skin and told what signs to look for, namely, change in
size, shape or colour. Photographic and dermatoscopic records are helpful for monitoring
these patients to detect early change. Any suspicious or changing atypical naevus should
be removed by excision biopsy. Careful photoprotection and sun avoidance are essential.

KEY POINTS

• Atypical melanocytic naevi occur sporadically or as part of the familial atypical naevus
syndrome.

• Patients with this syndrome have a far greater risk of developing melanoma.
• Patients diagnosed with this syndrome should undergo life-long surveillance.

CASE 61:

AN ENLARGING PIGMENTED MACULE ON THE FACE
OF AN ELDERLY MAN

History
A 73-year-old man presents with an 18-month history of a pigmented lesion on his
left cheek. He had not paid much attention to it and had assumed it to be a ‘sun spot’;
however, his daughter is concerned that it has been enlarging slowly and appears to be
getting darker in colour. She had taken her father to the GP who had then referred him
to the dermatology out-patient department. The patient is a retired roofer and keen gardener. He takes aspirin and an antihypertensive medication.
Examination
The patient has a brown to black macular lesion measuring 2 cm in diameter that has a
highly irregular border over his left cheek (Fig. 61.1). He is tanned but otherwise his full
skin check is unremarkable.
INVESTIGATIONS
An incisional skin biopsy was performed.

Questions
• What is the most likely diagnosis?
• What diagnosis should be excluded?
• How would you manage the patient?

Figure 61.1

139

ANSWER 61
Patients presenting with large pigmented lesions on their skin appearing in later life
always warrant referral to a dermatology specialist. This elderly patient had an outdoor
occupation before retirement and now spends long hours outside in the garden. Clinically
the most likely diagnosis is lentigo maligna (LM). These lesions usually appear in the
seventh to eighth decades of life. Sun-exposed sites including the face, neck and dorsi
of the hands are most commonly affected. Large macules appear with highly irregular
borders and significant variation of pigmentation from tan, brown to black. LM can
be a precursor for malignant melanoma in situ, so-called lentigo maligna melanoma
(LMM). Dermatologists have a low threshold for performing a biopsy from these lesions
to exclude malignant transformation. Sampling such large lesions with small punch
biopsies, however, may lead to sampling errors and the clinical appearance of the lesion
is also important in determining the ultimate management.
Histopathologically, LM is characterized by abnormal melanocytes confined within the
epidermis above the basement membrane. When atypical melanocytes invade the rich
vascular and lymphatic networks of the dermis, then this becomes LMM.
Possible risk factors for LM include ultraviolet light exposure, fair skin types and occupational risks. Differential diagnoses include solar and seborrhoeic keratoses and LMM.
The definitive treatment of LM is surgical excision. In many patients, however, surgery
may not be possible due to other co-morbidities. Other modalities of treatment that may
be considered include radiotherapy, cryotherapy and topical imiquimod 5% cream (which
is an immunomodulator).
The development of a papular or nodular element within the LM should lead to a high
suspicion of transformation to melanoma. LMM makes up 15 per cent of UK malignant
melanomas.

KEY POINTS

• Lentigo maligna (LM) occurs in the seventh or eighth decades on sun-exposed skin.
• LM can be a precursor for malignant melanoma.
• The definitive treatment of LM is surgical excision.

CASE 62:

A UNILATERAL RASH AROUND THE NIPPLE

History
A 68-year-old patient presents with a 3-year history of a rash surrounding her right nipple, which is red and mildly pruritic. She denies any discharge from the nipple. Topical
steroids prescribed by her GP had been ineffective so she was referred to the dermatology out-patient clinic. The patient has a history of eczema as a child and asthma. More
recently she has developed irritation on her hands since looking after her grand daughter
3 days per week. She is otherwise well and takes hormone replacement therapy.
Examination
There is a sharply demarcated erythematous plaque surrounding the right nipple with
some slight overlying scale, measuring 6 cm in diameter (Fig. 62.1). There is no obvious
underlying breast mass or axillary lymphadenopathy. The left nipple is normal and full
skin examination does not reveal any further similar areas. On the dorsi of her hands she
has an eczematous rash in the finger webs and under her wedding ring.
Questions
• What is the most likely diagnosis?
• How would you investigate this patient?
• What treatment options are possible?

Figure 62.1

141

ANSWER 62
Asymmetrical ‘eczema’ of the nipple that is unresponsive to topical steroids should
always raise the possibility of an underlying malignancy of the breast. Patients should
be referred for consideration of an urgent skin biopsy. This patient was diagnosed with
Paget’s disease of the right nipple. This represents the intra-epidermal spread of an
intraductal breast carcinoma. Although clinically this may mimic eczema a high index
of suspicion is needed if the patient is elderly, the disease is asymmetrical and largely
unresponsive to conventional eczema therapy. This patient did have a history of atopy;
however, atopic eczema of the nipple, although very common, is usually symmetrical and
responds rapidly to topical corticosteroids.
Paget’s disease is uncommon and involves the nipple or areola, and manifests as erythematous, well-demarcated plaques with overlying scale. It is most commonly seen in
woman over 50 years of age. Onset, as in this case, is usually very insidious. Lesions
can be asymptomatic or pruritic, painful, oedematous, bleeding or ulcerated. Sometimes
nipple retraction and discharge may occur. An underlying breast mass is palpable in less
than 50 per cent of patients.
A skin biopsy should be performed from the affected skin. A mammogram and further
work-up of any palpable breast mass is vital.
As with any other breast cancer, treatment consists of surgery, radiotherapy and/or
chemotherapy. Prognosis is variable and is worse when associated with an underlying
breast mass and lymph node involvement.
A similar condition called extramammary Paget’s disease may occur away from the nipple
and present with a similar eczema-like eruption, usually around the female/male anogenital region or axilla. It is histologically similar to Paget’s disease and may be associated
with intra-epidermal spread of a ductal apocrine carcinoma of the lower gastrointestinal
tract, urinary or female genital tract.
KEY POINTS

• Paget’s disease should be suspected when presented with asymmetrical ‘eczema’ of the
nipple.

• An underlying breast mass is palpable in less than 50 per cent of patients.
• Extramammary disease occurs mainly around the female/male anogenital region.

CASE 63:

A CHANGING PIGMENTED LESION ON THE LEG

History
A 39-year-old woman presents to the dermatology ‘two-week-wait’ clinic with a changing pigmented lesion on her leg. Her partner reported that it had been changing over
the last five months. She has type II skin and had moved to the United Kingdom from
Australia 5 years previously. Whilst in Australia she had regular skin checks as her father
had been diagnosed with malignant melanoma 6 years previously. She is otherwise well
and takes no medication other than the oral contraceptive pill.
Examination
She has an asymmetrical, macular, variably pigmented lesion measuring 1.4 cm in diameter on her posterior calf (Fig. 63.1). With the dermatoscope the dermatologist notes a
central whitish/blue area in the centre.
INVESTIGATIONS
Excision of the lesion was performed.

Questions
• What is the diagnosis?
• How would you determine the prognosis?
• What management would you organize?

Figure 63.1

143

ANSWER 63
This pigmented lesion looks highly abnormal as it is asymmetrical, has an irregular
border and colour and therefore, clinically, is a malignant melanoma. This patient was
brought up in Australia where ultraviolet light is intense; a change in the mole had been
noted and she had a positive family history of malignant melanoma (MM).
Malignant melanoma is a malignant skin tumour of melanocytes. It is the most aggressive
type of skin cancer. Its incidence has doubled in the past decade. Melanoma is amongst
the commonest type of cancer in young adults. Approximately 30 per cent of melanomas arise in a pre-existing naevus and the rest appear de novo. MM is more common in
Fitzpatrick skin types I and II and has an increasing incidence closer to the equator. The
aetiology is complex, however. It is known that genetic predisposition and ultraviolet
light exposure (particularly intermittent sun-burning episodes) are likely to play a role.
A pigmented lesion that demonstrates significant change should be excised to exclude
melanoma. The A-B-C-D-E rule of melanoma is a useful tool for determining if a lesion
is suspicious:
A – Asymmetrical shape
B – Border or Bleeding. The outline of a mole should be regular.
C – Colour. Benign naevi have a uniform colour. Those naevi with differing pigment
should be evaluated carefully.
D – Diameter. Melanomas are usually  6mm in diameter.
E – Evolution: any change noted in a mole
There are four main different variants of melanoma:

• Superficial spreading melanoma is the most common type and has a female preponderance. The lower leg is a common site. Clinically, the lesions are usually enlarging
brown/black macules with irregular margins and varying degrees of pigmentation. Some
lesions may show signs of regression (areas of paleness/whiteness within).
• Nodular melanoma is more common in men and is most frequently reported on the
posterior trunk. Clinically it appears as a pigmented papule or nodule that may ulcerate. During its horizontal phase of growth, the melanoma is normally flat, that is,
superficial spreading melanoma. A nodular melanoma
occurs as the vertical phase develops and the melanoma becomes clinically thickened and raised.
• Acral lentiginous melanomas occur on the palmar
plantar regions and subungal sites. They are the most
common form of melanoma in Fitzpatrick skin types
IV–VI. Acral melanomas may present as a pigmented
macule or as a black area around the subungal skin and
nail (Fig. 63.2). The diagnosis is frequently delayed due
to the skin sites affected and patients’ lack of awareness,
hence they often present late with a poor prognosis.
• Lentigo maligna melanoma is a melanoma that arises
within a lentigo maligna.
Figure 63.2
KEY POINTS

• Malignant melanoma (MM) is the most aggressive type of skin cancer.
• It is more common in Fitzpatrick skin types I and II.
• Variants include superficial spreading, nodular, acral and lentigo maligna melanomas.

CASE 64:

A PIGMENTED NODULE ON THE BACK

History
A 29-year-old man presents with a nodule over his posterior trunk. He had recently
moved into a flat with friends who had noticed the lesion and advised him to go to the
GP. As far as the patient can remember he has had a mole on his back since childhood
at the site of the nodule. He has Fitzpatrick skin type I and always burns in the sun, if
not careful, and never tans. His family is also fair skinned. He is otherwise well and takes
no medication.
Examination
There is a reddish brown nodule arising from a deeply pigmented, irregular macule with
variable colour (Fig. 64.1). Full skin examination reveals freckling over his face and
shoulders and multiple acquired moles which looked benign.
INVESTIGATIONS
Excision of the lesion was performed.

Questions
• What is the likely diagnosis?
• What determines his prognosis?
• How should this patient be managed?

Figure 64.1

145

ANSWER 64
This young man has a nodular pigmented lesion on the posterior trunk that has changed
in size, shape and colour. The clinical appearance of this lesion should immediately raise
the possibility of a nodular malignant melanoma.
Any patient concerned about a mole or skin lesion should have a full skin examination to
check all their moles. A suspected melanoma should be excised for histological analysis
with a 2-mm margin around it. The pathologist will report the thickness of the melanoma –
the Breslow thickness (local invasion) in millimetres. This is the measurement between
the granular cell layer to the deepest identifiable melanoma cell. The full skin check of
a patient with a suspected malignant melanoma should also include examination of the
lymph nodes.
The ‘gold standard’ treatment of melanomas is surgical. The extent of surgery depends
on the thickness of the melanoma and its site. A small area of normal skin around the
melanoma is also excised to ensure that all melanoma cells have been removed. This is
termed a wide local excision (WLE). For lesions with a Breslow thickness of  1 mm
a 1-cm WLE is required; for lesions  1 mm a 2-cm WLE is advised. For these thicker
melanomas a technique called a sentinel lymph node biopsy may be offered to patients
to exclude lymphatic spread. The sentinel lymph node biopsy can predict the presence
of clinically non-detectable metastatic melanoma within regional lymph nodes through
histopathology. The first node draining a lymphatic basin is termed the ‘sentinel node’.
If positive, a full basin clearance is offered and all the nodes are examined for further
micro-metastases.
If the melanoma has spread to distant sites adjuvant therapies may be offered, but the
prognosis is very poor. Distant metastases most commonly occur in lungs, liver, brain,
bone and intestines.
Prognosis is determined by the staging classification: local disease T 1–4 a, b; disease in
the regional lymph nodes N 1–3; and distant spread M 1a, b, c. The thinner the Breslow
thickness, the better the prognosis. For those patients whose melanoma is  4 mm thick,
50 per cent will die within 5 years.
Following diagnosis, regular follow-up is essential to detect any recurrence. This includes
local, lymphatic (lymph nodes) and blood borne (to distant sites). Examination of the
scar site to exclude in-transit metastases, full skin examination, lymph node checks and
palpation for organomegaly are required. A full systematic review should also be performed to exclude any distant spread. The periodicy and regularity of follow-up is also
determined by the stage of the melanoma.
KEY POINTS

• Patients with a changing naevus should have a full skin examination.
• Breslow thickness measures the invasion depth of a melanoma in millimetres.
• Sentinel lymph node biopsy predicts clinically non-detectable metastatic disease.

CASE 65:

LONGSTANDING ERYTHEMATOUS SCALY PATCHES

History
A 54-year-old woman presents with a widespread eruption that has persisted for almost
20 years. She had initially noticed the first few patches over her pelvic girdle, but slowly
over the years the patches have become more widespread. The patches are occasionally
mildly itchy; she has noticed a slight dryness over their surface. She has tried over-thecounter antifungal creams and emollients with no real benefit. She is systemically well
and takes hormone replacement therapy.
Examination
There is an extensive eruption of multiple erythematous patches with overlying scale over
the trunk and limbs, occurring predominantly in unexposed areas (Fig. 65.1). The patches
are oval to annular in shape and most, but not all, are well demarcated. Some of the areas
are thicker, forming thin plaques.
INVESTIGATIONS
A skin biopsy was performed.

Questions
• What is the diagnosis?
• What are the differential diagnoses?
• What are the options for treatment?

Figure 65.1

147

ANSWER 65
Any patient presenting with a very long history of a slowly progressive skin eruption that
is unresponsive to topical therapy warrants a skin biopsy. The diagnosis that shouldn’t be
missed is mycosis fungoides, a form of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL). This patient is
typical of those presenting with an indolent rash over many years that has a predilection
for the pelvic girdle. The condition in the early stages classically presents with erythematous patches with fine overlying scale.
CTCL encompasses 65 per cent of all cutaneous lymphomas. Mycosis fungoides is the
commonest of these, accounting for almost half of all cases. It is a low-grade T-cell
lymphoma in which there is an abnormal neoplastic proliferation of lymphocytes of a
´T´ subtype (thymus-derived). There is a male predominance and it has an incidence of
1 per 100 000 per year.
The average time from disease onset to diagnosis is 7 years. Patients may be misdiagnosed
with psoriasis, parapsoriasis, discoid eczema or tinea corporis. Even for an experienced
dermatologist the diagnosis may be a challenge, as several skin biopsies may be required
to finally clinch the suspected diagnosis of CTCL. Histopathology classically shows atypical lymphocytes in the upper dermis extending into the epidermis with epidermotropism
and Pautriers’ microabscesses. T-cell gene rearrangement studies from skin biopsies can
help to confirm the diagnosis by showing a clone of abnormal T-lymphocytes.
CTCL has three skin stages:
1. Patch stage: macular erythema to patches with overlying scale predominantly over
non-exposed skin. Spontaneous resolution, fixed lesions and slow progression may be
seen. Involved skin can be pruritic and atrophic (thinned).
2. Plaque stage: The patches become thickened and form plaques.
3. Tumour stage: Large irregular nodules develop within plaques, or de novo. At this
stage, spread to other organs is more likely than in the earlier stages.
CTCL may remain confined to the skin for many years running an indolent course, but
the abnormal cells can eventually infiltrate other tissues including blood, lymph nodes
and visceral sites, usually in the context of extensive cutaneous involvement with widespread plaques, tumours or erythroderma. Unlike some other lymphomas, the prognosis
is generally good. However, acurate diagnosis and staging is critical in determining the
prognosis of those with CTCL. Investigations therefore are tailored to the clinical setting.
Management of patients should be carried out by a multidisciplinary team. Currently,
treatment is not curative but is aimed at controlling symptoms and cosmesis whilst
limiting toxicity. Early-stage disease is treated with skin-directed therapy such as topical corticosteroids, phototherapy (psoralen–UVA) and radiotherapy. Patch-stage disease
usually improves with topical and phototherapy whereas more infiltrated plaques may
require radiotherapy. More advanced disease requires more aggressive treatment including extracorporeal photophoresis, oral retinoids, interferon, single-agent and multi-agent
chemotherapy, and even stem-cell bone marrow transplantation.
KEY POINTS

• Mycosis fungoides is the most common form of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma.
• It is an indolent rash that has a predilection for the pelvic girdle.
• It may infiltrate other tissues including blood, lymph nodes and visceral sites.

CASE 66:

A SLOW-GROWING PLUM-COLOURED SKIN NODULE

History
A 63-year-old man presents to the dermatology out-patient clinic with a slowly growing
nodule on his back. He had been unaware of it but his wife is worried as she feels that
it has grown over the past year. There is no previous history of skin problems. He takes
amlodipine, aspirin and simvastatin and is systemically well.
Examination
There a 3 cm  3 cm red to plum coloured, firm, non-tender, solitary nodule with a
smooth surface on his back (Fig. 66.1). Full skin examination does not reveal any further
lesions and there is no evidence of peripheral lymphadenopathy.
INVESTIGATIONS
A skin biopsy was performed.

Questions
• What are the clinical differential
diagnoses?
• How should the patient be managed?
• What is the prognosis?

Figure 66.1

149

ANSWER 66
The differential diagnoses of a firm, indurated erythematous purple papule/nodule that
remains fixed for a period of time on the trunk include sarcoid, cutaneous metastasis
B-cell lymphoma, Kaposi’s sarcoma, and a keloid scar. Skin biopsy with histopathology
and immunophenotyping should help to clarify the diagnosis.
This patient was diagnosed with cutaneous B-cell lymphoma, CBCL (a primary cutaneous
follicle centre cell lymphoma). CBCL develops when a clonal proliferation of B lymphocytes is confined to the skin. Primary cutaneous lymphomas of the B-cell type
comprise approximately 20 per cent of cutaneous lymphomas. Other types of CBCL
include primary cutaneous marginal zone, primary cutaneous large B-cell, leg type, and
primary cutaneous diffuse large B-cell lymphomas.
Follicle centre cell lymphomas are clinically characterized as asymptomatic nodules,
plaques or tumours. CBCL lesions are slow-growing, usually red to plum in colour and
are firm with a smooth surface. Common sites include the trunk, scalp and forehead.
Primary CBCL needs to be differentiated from a secondary cutaneous lymphoma, which
is where a nodal follicular lymphoma has metastasized to involve the skin. This can be
differentiated by molecular techniques to demonstrate a lack of the t (14;18) chromosomal translocation.
For solitary lesions or small groups, the treatment of choice is local radiotherapy. For
those patients with multiple lesions at distant sites, then chemotherapy may be required.
The prognosis is excellent with a 5-year survival of more than 95 per cent.
For the other cutaneous subtypes, patients should be investigated thoroughly for nodal
and extracutaneous disease. These investigations include peripheral blood studies, bone
marrow biopsy, radiographic imaging and, if indicated, lymph node biopsy.
KEY POINTS

• Cutaneous B-cell lymphoma (CBCL) occurs when a clonal proliferation of
B lymphocytes is confined to the skin.

• Follicle centre cell lymphomas are characterized as asymptomatic nodules.

CASE 67:

PAPULAR AND PUSTULAR ERUPTION ON THE FACE
WITH SCARRING

History
A 25-year-old woman presents to the dermatology clinic with a long history of a facial
eruption that has been getting worse progressively over the past few years. Some of the
lesions on her face are painful at times and sometimes heal with scarring. The rest of
her skin is unaffected. Her GP had prescribed several prolonged courses of tetracycline
antibiotics with little benefit, and she was unable to tolerate erythromycin due to its
gastrointestinal side effects. She took Dianette (oral contraceptive pill) for several months
but this had to be stopped as it was significantly lowering her mood.
Examination
There are numerous comedomes, particularly on her forehead, pustules, papules, inflammatory lesions, cysts and atrophic scars (Fig. 67.1). There is sparing of the periorbital
skin.
Questions
• What is the likely diagnosis?
• What is the underlying pathophysiology?
• What treatment would you suggest?

Figure 67.1

151

ANSWER 67
This patient had been suffering from acne vulgaris on her face for many years. This is a
common condition, which usually starts around puberty but can persist into the third or
fourth decades. Acne lesions develop from sebaceous glands that produce lipid material
called sebum. Blockage of the sebaceous glands results in comedomes, which appear as
small monomorphic papules, often on the forehead and cheeks. Comedomes can be closed
(whiteheads) or open (blackheads) and are usually the primary acne lesions. In addition,
there is increased sebum production and numbers of Proprionibacterium acnes bacteria
within the ducts, which leads to inflammation around the glands. Painful cysts can then
form which may heal with scarring.
Various factors are known to play a role in the development of acne including androgens,
testosterone, oestrogens, sweating, occlusive oils and steroids. Women may develop acne
as part of the polycystic ovarian syndrome. The impact of acne on a patient’s well-being
should not be underestimated. Many acne patients lose self-confidence and feel depressed
as a consequence of their highly visible skin disease. Patients should therefore be treated
early and effectively.
Most patients start on the acne treatment ladder with topical therapies (antibiotics, retinoids, benzoyl peroxide), and then progress to systemic treatment with antibiotics (tetracyclines, erythromycin), hormone preparations (females) and finally isotretinoin.
Isotretinoin is a vitamin A-derived medication, which is highly effective at treating and
usually ‘curing’ acne through its action of shrinking-down the sebaceous glands by
90 per cent. Despite its high efficacy it is usually reserved for treating resistant or severe
acne owing to its unfavourable side-effect profile.
Isotretinoin is teratogenic (90 per cent risk of birth defects). Therefore, women of childbearing age who are sexually active need a reliable form of contraception. The reduction
in sebum production means patients taking the medication may suffer from severely dry
lips and skin. Other side effects include a temporary rise in liver enzymes and lipids.
Mood change and depression are potential side effects and therefore care should be taken
when prescribing the medication to those with a history of depression or mental illness.
Patients usually take a cumulative target dose of isotretinoin between 120 and 150 mg/kg
body weight over six to nine months. Most patients benefit from long-term elimination
of their acne.
Residual scarring may be treated with topical retinoids, chemical peels, laser resurfacing
and tiny pinch-grafts.
KEY POINTS

• Acne is a common condition affecting up to 80 per cent of Western populations.
• Acne lesions include comedomes, papules, pustules, cysts and eventually scarring.
• Isotretinoin is a highly effective treatment for acne but needs careful prescribing and
monitoring.

CASE 68:

A RED FACE WITH PAPULES AND PUSTULES

History
A 59-year-old man attends the dermatology clinic for a skin review following renal
transplantation for hypertensive nephropathy. He is immunosuppressed with sirolimus
and mycophenolate mofetil. He has a few viral warts on his hands but his main complaint
is a 6-month history of facial redness and painful ‘spots’. The erythema is exacerbated
by heat. He has applied a bland emollient cream and topical antibacterials to the affected
areas with little benefit. At the initial consultation he is noted to have a florid facial erythema with multiple papules and pustules over his forehead and cheeks. He is commenced
on oral minocycline 100 mg daily and is asked to come back in 3 months.
Examination
On review after 3 months of minocycline his facial eruption is starting to improve but he
has persistent erythema, papules and pustules; he is also noted to have a slate grey colour
starting to appear on his nose (Fig. 68.1).
Questions
• What is the initial cutaneous diagnosis?
• What is the cause of the grey pigmentation on his nose?
• How would you now manage this patient?

Figure 68.1

153

ANSWER 68
This renal transplantation patient was suffering from florid rosacea that was unresponsive to topical therapy. He was treated with oral minocycline with some improvement
in his rosacea after a few months. Rosacea is an acneiform condition that causes facial
flushing, fixed erythema, papules, pustules and cutaneous oedema. If the tissue swelling
becomes chronic then rhinophyma can result. Patients usually report an exacerbation of
their condition with heat, spicy food and alcohol. Their erythematous skin tends to be
sensitive and numerous topical preparations can cause burning or stinging.
Oral tetracyclines are usually highly effective in the treatment of rosacea. However, this
patient developed slate-grey pigmentation on his nose secondary to the minocycline
antibiotic. Of patients taking minocycline 3.7 per cent are reported to develop some
altered skin pigmentation, usually within five months of commencing the treatment. The
development of minocycline-induced pigmentation is not dose dependent. In many but
not in all cases the slate-grey pigmentation fades eventually on discontinuation of the
minocycline. This patient’s minocycline was stopped and he was switched to oral lymecycline 408 mg daily which was effective in treating his rosacea.
The patient was given some sun-protection advice as tetracyclines can be photosensitizing. In addition patients who are post-transplantation and on immunosuppressive drugs
are at an increased risk of skin cancer, therefore skin surveillance and sun-protection are
paramount.
KEY POINTS

• Rosacea is an acne-like condition with pustules and papules but also erythema and
flushing.

• A side effect of oral minocycline is a slate-grey pigmentation in the skin, which may be
permanent.

• Post-transplant patients on immunosuppressive medication are at increased risk of skin
cancer.

CASE 69:

SUDDEN-ONSET FACIAL CRUSTING AND BLISTERING
IN A CHILD

History
A 5-year-old boy presents to the accident and emergency department with a suddenonset facial eruption over the previous 24 hours. Initially the skin was erythematous and
crusted, then his parents noticed blisters developing and were understandably concerned.
Apart from a fever the previous day he is otherwise well, and is eating and drinking normally. He is recovering from a recent episode of chickenpox but otherwise has had no
previous skin problems. No one else at home is obviously affected.
Examination
There are crusted resolving chickenpox lesions on his face, trunk and limbs. On his central face there are acute tense bullae and areas of golden crusting (Fig. 69.1), but no ulcers
or erosions. Calamine lotion applied to the skin by his parents has given him a patchy
white appearance. Elsewhere on the trunk and limbs there are healing crusted lesions
and post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation. He is now apyrexial and has normal blood
pressure and pulse rate.
INVESTIGATIONS
Full blood count, renal and liver function tests were normal.
Skin swabs were taken for microbiology and virology cultures.

Questions
• Why do blisters form?
• What is the differential diagnosis?
• Who else may be affected?

Figure 69.1

155

ANSWER 69
Blisters (vesicles and bullae) are usually a sign of an acute cutaneous reaction. Blisters
comprise clear, serous fluid, which may become cloudy due to the accumulation of neutrophils (pus), or blood-stained due to vascular damage. Blisters can form due to damage
to the adhesion structures in between cells; this damage can result from friction/pressure,
heat, infections, autoimmune-mediated complexes, phototoxic reactions, adverse drug
reactions, and congenital deficiencies or malfunction of adhesion structures within the
skin. Blisters can also form due to cutaneous oedema.
This child has bullous impetigo, which results from a cutaneous infection with exotoxinproducing strains of Staphylococcus aureus (confirmed by skin swabs). Exotoxins cause
loss of cell–cell adhesion in the epidermis, resulting in superficial blisters which break
down, leaving denuded areas and classic golden crusting. Impetigo is very common,
especially in children, and is highly contagious with spread by direct inoculation. The
initial infection may occur through a small break in the skin – this child had resolving
chickenpox lesions which left his skin vulnerable to secondary bacterial infection. Other
family members are commonly subsequently infected by contact with the index case.
Classically, impetigo develops rapidly on localized areas of skin. Blisters, pustules,
erosions and golden crusted exudate complete the clinical picture. Patients are usually
otherwise well. Skin swabs may isolate S. aureus or occasionally Streptococcus (group A).
Localized cutaneous impetigo can be managed with topical antiseptics such as dilute
chlorhexidine to wash the skin and topical antibiotics such as fusidic acid, polymyxin
or mupirocin. Oral antibiotics such as flucloxacillin or erythromycin may be required if
involvement is more widespread.
KEY POINTS

• Blisters indicate an acute cutaneous reaction.
• Impetigo is common and highly contagious.
• Patients with localized disease may be managed with topical antibiotics.

CASE 70:

AN ERYTHEMATOUS PAINFUL FACE

History
A 50-year-old woman presents to the accident and emergency department with a 2-day
history of painful facial swelling that was unresponsive to chlorpheniramine. She had
seen her GP 1-day previously who prescribed flucloxacillin 500 mg qds; however, over
the next day the pain and swelling had worsened. On direct questioning she thinks she
may have been stung by an insect 3 days ago on her left cheek. The eruption is not pruritic. She has no known allergies.
Examination
There is a well-demarcated, confluent, livid erythema
with oedema and bullae formation, mainly on the left
side of her face but spreading to the right (Fig. 70.1).
There is no evidence of any skin erosions, no mucous
membrane involvement and her vision is unaffected.
She is apyrexial. Her blood pressure is 134/89 mmHg,
pulse rate 92 /min, oxygen saturation on air 97%,
blood sugar level on finger prick testing 7.9 mmol/L.

Questions
• What is the diagnosis?
• What is the likely underlying cause?
• What treatment would you initiate?
157

ANSWER 70
This patient was diagnosed clinically with erysipelas. This is a cutaneous infection, usually caused on the face by group A Streptococcus pyogenes, which may originate from
the patient’s throat. The history of a possible insect bite was not thought to be significant
but any minor skin laceration would act as a port of entry to microorganisms. The spread
of the erythema is characteristically rapid and well demarcated (you could outline the
edge with a skin marker); this contrasts with cellulitis, which usually has a slower onset
with ill-defined margins. Cellulitis is deep, erysipelas is more superficial. Erysipelas may
also affect the lower limb. The confluent erythema is very oedematous and consequently
vesicles or bullae may form.
The differential diagnosis of sudden-onset facial erythema includes ‘slapped cheek’ or
fifth disease, however this usually occurs in children, is symmetrical, and there is little
oedema and no blistering. An acute allergic reaction usually presents more rapidly over a
few hours rather than days and usually results from ingesting an allergen; such patients
usually have lip swelling and may have gastrointestinal upset.
Patients with erysipelas should be managed initially with intravenous antibiotics. This
patient was given 1.2 g benzylpenicillin and 2 g flucloxacillin qds for 2 days. The large
bullae were deflated using a sterile needle. Gauze soaked in diluted potassium permanganate solution was applied to the affected skin once daily and topical fusidic acid applied.
The patient was discharged on oral amoxicillin 1 g tds for 2 weeks.
KEY POINTS

• Erysipelas characteristically affects the face or lower limb.
• The onset or erysipelas is rapid over 48 hours with well-demarcated erythema.
• Group A Streptococcus is usually the cause and should be treated initially with intravenous antibiotics.

A HOT, SWOLLEN LEG

History
A 55-year-old woman presents to the accident and emergency department with a 6-day history of swelling of
her right lower leg. She has been finding it increasingly
difficult to walk due to the pain. She does not recall any
preceding trauma to her leg, and she has not recently travelled. She has no respiratory symptoms and has not had a
temperature. There is no history of previous skin problems.
She is otherwise fit and well.
Examination
The right leg is hot, swollen and erythematous with
indistinct borders (Fig. 71.1). Blisters are forming at the
margins of the involved skin and several have broken

Questions
• What is the most likely diagnosis?
• What organism might you expect to be the cause?
• What management would you implement?
159

ANSWER 71
This patient has cellulitis of the right leg. She has the classic signs of erythema, heat,
swelling and local tenderness. Oedema blisters developed on the involved skin secondary to acute tissue swelling. The fragile blisters rapidly de-roofed (loss of the overlying
epidermis) leaving eroded areas. Her duplex scan of the right lower leg was technically
challenging due to the marked oedema, so thrombus could not be ruled out. However,
the clinical signs were most in keeping with infection rather than thrombus. Occasionally
patients have tender regional lymphadenopathy and a fever.
A swab taken from the involved skin was negative for microorganisms, which is typical
in cellulitis as the infection is in the dermis and subcutis. Blood cultures are usually negative as most patients do not develop a bacteraemia. The cutaneous infection triggers an
inflammatory response, which leads to the clinical signs of localized erythema, swelling,
heat and tenderness.
As with most cases of lower leg cellulitis there was no history of trauma or preceding
skin disease in this case. Occasionally patients may have tinea pedis (fungal infection)
between their toes, which can act as a portal of entry to bacteria.
Cellulitis is most commonly caused by group A Streptococci or Staphylococcus aureus.
Streptococcus pneumoniae can cause a very severe cellulitis of the leg, presenting with
haemorrhagic bullae and necrosis, usually in immunocompromised patients or those
with diabetes. S. pneumoniae may also cause cellulitis of the face as can Haemophilus
influenzae type B.
Patients with moderate or severe cellulitis should be treated with intravenous antibiotics,
usually in hospital. Benzylpenicillin, cephalosporins or macrolides can be given. Initially
patients should rest, elevate their legs and be given suitable analgesia. Topical treatment
may include potassium permanganate soaks, deflation of tense blisters, applications of
topical antibiotics (to prevent secondary bacterial colonization) to any eroded areas and
gentle compression to reduce the oedema.

KEY POINTS

• Cellulitis is usually unilateral, the leg is hot, swollen, erythematous and tender.
• Skin swabs and blood cultures are usually negative for microbiological culture.
• Intravenous antibiotics are usually required plus elevation of the leg and light compression.

CASE 72:

PAINFUL AREAS OF SUPERFICIALLY ERODED SKIN IN
THE FLEXURES OF A CHILD

History
A 4-year-old girl is admitted to hospital with painful raw areas in her axillae, neck and
groin. These have developed over 24 hours. Her skin had initially become erythematous
and inflamed before peeling off to leave large superficial eroded areas in her flexures. She
has a history of atopic eczema but is otherwise well. Her mother had suffered recurrent
boils on the lower legs following varicose vein surgery one year previously but her skin
was currently clear. The patient has not travelled abroad and does not have contact with
animals. She does have intermittent contact with a childminder and other young children.
Examination
On admission the child looks unwell and is in pain, and her temperature is 38.3 oC. She
holds her arms away from her body. Skin inspection reveals erythema and desquamation
in her axillae (Fig. 72.1), groin (Fig. 72.2) and around her neck. She has moderate eczema
on her limb flexures. Her mucous membranes are normal.
INVESTIGATIONS
Swabs were taken from the groin and axillae.
Blood tests were normal.

Figure 72.1

Figure 72.2

Questions
• What is the clinical diagnosis?
• What are the swabs likely to isolate?
• How would you treat this patient?

161

ANSWER 72
This child looked unwell and had tender skin. There was extensive erythema and desquamation in her groin and axillae leading to a diagnosis of staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome (SSSS). This is an exfoliative toxin-mediated bacterial infection mainly affecting
children under the age of 5 years. Flexural areas of skin are classically involved; however,
the cutaneous involvement may become widespread. Children may have suffered a recent
bacterial infection of their ear or throat. Children with atopic eczema are frequently colonized by Staphylococcus aureus, of which 5 per cent of strains produce exotoxins which
are spread through the blood leading to widespread skin involvement by SSSS.
Children may be pyrexial and appear unwell; they do not want their skin to be touched
at the affected sites owing to tenderness/pain. Lateral pressure on affected skin can lead
to a positive Nikolsky’s sign (the superficial skin sloughs-off). Swabs from involved skin
usually isolate S. aureus; strain typing and identification of exotoxins can be carried out
if the diagnosis is in doubt. Interestingly, blood cultures are usually negative in children.
This child’s skin swabs also isolated Pseudomonas, which is an opportunistic secondary
colonizer of eroded skin.
The patient was admitted to hospital and treated with oral flucloxacillin (intravenous
lines should be avoided in patients with fragile/infected skin if possible) plus topical
combination fusidic acid and hydrocortisone. She washed in a mild chlorhexidine lotion
as the pain settled.
This child had several episodes of SSSS over a few months. Swabs from family members and close contacts were negative for S. aureus nasal carriage. The patient therefore
required a prolonged course of oral flucloxacillin to try to prevent relapse. She was
also treated with clindamycin, which inhibits exotoxin formation by S. aureus. The
Pseudomonas was treated with ciprofloxacin as it was felt in this case that the bacterium
was having a significant secondary impact on slow skin healing. Mild topical hydrogen
peroxide cream was also used as a local antiseptic.

KEY POINTS

• Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome (SSSS) usually occurs in children under the age
of 5 years.

• Erythema and desquamation, especially in the flexures, is common with SSSS and may
be widespread.

• Systemic and topical antibiotics plus antiseptic washes usually settle the condition over
a few weeks.

CASE 73:

ASYMPTOMATIC ERYTHEMATOUS SCALY PATCHES ON
THE PALMS AND SOLES

History
A 32-year-old actor presents to the accident and emergency department with a 7-day
history of malaise, fever, aching in his joints and neck, and a persistent headache. He has
also noticed a rash on his palms and soles and is worried that he might have developed
meningitis. He had eczema as a child but otherwise no previous skin problems. He takes
antihistamines for hay fever. He lives alone and has no significant past medical history.
The casualty officer arranges for some preliminary blood tests and asks for a dermatological opinion on the skin eruption.
Examination
There are multiple, small erythematous macules 1–4 mm in diameter and patches with
mild superficial scale on his palms (Fig. 73.1) and plantar aspect of his feet (Fig. 73.2).
Some of the lesions are slightly pigmented and there is some desquamation in places. He
has a few similar lesions scattered over his trunk. The lesions are blanching. His mucous
membranes, scalp and nails are normal. He has mild neck stiffness but no photophobia
and his temperature is 38.0 oC.
INVESTIGATIONS
Blood tests results were requested.

Figure 73.1

Questions
• What is the clinical diagnosis?
• What tests would you need to perform
to confirm the diagnosis?
• How would you manage this patient?

Figure 73.2

163

ANSWER 73
Fever, headache and a rash is a common combination of symptoms with a wide differential diagnosis. Many viral infections such as measles, chickenpox, Epstein–Barr virus
and viral meningitis can present in this way. This patient was concerned about bacterial meningitis but the rash was blanching and not purpuric. The diagnosis is secondary
syphilis, which can be easily missed. The rash of secondary syphilis is frequently subtle
and asymptomatic in most cases. Patients develop non-specific symptoms of malaise and
may not present to a medical practitioner.
The rash of secondary syphilis classically affects the palms, soles and trunk, but may
become widespread. Lesions start as small erythematous papules and macules that may
become slightly scaly and form erythematous-to-pigmented patches. The eruption is usually asymptomatic and may be misdiagnosed as guttate psoriasis. Patients usually develop ‘flu-like’ or even ‘meningitis-like’ symptoms. The rash of secondary syphilis usually
appears 1–3 months following the initial infection. The spirochete Treponema pallidum
is usually transmitted by sexual intercourse and at the site of entry a small painless ulcer
(chancre) appears on the genitals/mouth.
If syphilis remains untreated a tertiary stage affecting several organ systems can develop
many years later. Classically, the central nervous system is affected leading to mental
disturbance and even dementia, spinal cord involvement leads to sensory neuropathy and
autonomic dysfunction of the bladder. Cutaneous manifestations at this late stage include
nodules (gummas) which may ulcerate.
Early diagnosis is essential to ensure long-term sequelae are avoided and the infection is
not passed on. Serological tests are the key to confirming the diagnosis at the secondary
syphilis stage. Specific treponemal antibody tests include TPHA (T. pallidum haemagglutination) and TPPA (T. pallidum particle agglutination), which can confirm infection with
syphilis. However, the exact timing of disease acquisition may only be estimated owing
to rising or falling titres of non-specific tests such as VDRL (Venereal Disease Research
Laboratory) and RPR (rapid plasma regain). The latter usually becomes negative after
effective treatment whereas TPHA remains positive for life.
If patients present with a chancre, then a smear can be taken onto a glass slide for darkfield immunofluorescence microscopy to identify the spirochaetes. Patients should also
undergo a full sexual health screen and be offered an HIV test, as the two diseases may
be transmitted simultaneously.
Treatment of early disease is with intramuscular benzathine penicillin G 2.4 million units
in a single dose, and for late disease is four times weekly for 3 weeks. Use of ceftriaxone
and azithromycin is currently being evaluated but appears highly effective. For penicillinsensitive patients doxycycline has been traditionally prescribed 100 mg daily for 14 days
(increased to 30 days in late disease and 200 mg daily for 30 days for neurosyphilis).
KEY POINTS

• The incidence of syphilis worldwide is increasing and may be simultaneously transmitted
with HIV.

• The rash of secondary syphilis may be subtle with palmar/plantar red/brown scaly
macules/patches.

• A combination of serological tests is usually needed to confirm the disease and the
stage.

CASE 74:

ACUTE-ONSET BLISTER ON THE LIP WITH FACIAL
SWELLING AND PAIN

History
A 10-year-old boy presents to the accident and emergency department with a 7-day history of a blister, which appeared on his lower lip with subsequent crusting and is now
spreading over the right side of his cheek. He complains of pain in his mouth, lip and
right side of his face, which feels swollen. He is initially referred to the maxillary-facial
team with a suspected dental abscess. An orthopantomogram X-ray is normal; he is then
referred to the on-call dermatology team. He reports an allergy to erythromycin.
Examination
He has tense blistering and erythematous crusted lesions on his right lower lip and cheek
(Fig. 74.1). There is erythema that has golden crusting with vesiculation particularly on
his lower lip. He has tender lymphadenopathy in the supraclavicular region. Inside his
mouth there is no evidence of a dental abscess.
INVESTIGATIONS
Swabs were taken for microbiological and virological analysis.

Questions
• What is the most likely diagnosis?
• What secondary cutaneous complication has arisen?
• How would you manage this patient
acutely and in the future?

Figure 74.1

165

ANSWER 74
When any patient presents with a blistering eruption on the lip, the most likely diagnosis
is herpes simplex virus (HSV), usually type I. Patients may describe a prodrome of tingling and pain 24–48 hours prior to the onset of blistering. Although the lip is the most
common site (herpes labialis), lesions of HSV can occur at other mucous membrane sites
(nose and genitalia, usually type II), or indeed anywhere else on the skin.
Primary HSV is usually asymptomatic, however in a small minority of patients the initial
infection can be very severe and extensive. Subsequent attacks occur due to reactivation of the life-long persistent HSV, which stays within the dorsal root ganglion of the
affected nerve. Attacks of so-called ‘cold-sores’ can occur at intervals, usually at the same
mucous membrane/skin site. Triggers include cold weather, bright sunlight, immunosuppression, intercurrent illness, trauma and high altitude.
The differential diagnosis of blistering on the lips includes primary impetigo, burn/
trauma, hand-foot and mouth, erythema multiforme major, Stevens–Johnson syndrome,
toxic epidermal necrolysis, fixed drug eruption, immunobullous disease and porphyria.
The history, clinical signs and investigations should, however, help to distinguish HSV
from these other diagnoses.
This patient suffered a HSV type I infection of the right lower lip and subsequently
developed secondary impetigo due to Staphylococcus aureus (an ‘aureus’ was a gold
coin issued in Rome in the first century BC). Secondary bacterial infection is particularly
common with HSV infections and is characterized by golden crusted areas on the skin.
Antibacterial washes containing low concentrations of chlorhexidine (Dermol®) are helpful in clearing mild, localized skin infections. Topical (fucidin) or oral antibiotics (flucloxacillin, erythromycin) are required in some cases.
Swabs that were sent to the laboratory in viral transport medium confirmed the presence
of HSV type I DNA. If patients present within 72 hours of the onset of HSV infections,
then a course of oral aciclovir is helpful. Patients can purchase topical aciclovir over
the counter, which can be effective in mild attacks if treated early. Patients developing
recurrent symptomatic attacks may benefit from secondary prophylaxis with aciclovir
400 mg daily, other patients may prefer to have some aciclovir tablets at home to take
immediately they become symptomatic with the prodrome/blisters.

KEY POINTS

• Herpes simplex virus (HSV) reactivation is usually preceded by a cutaneous prodrome
of tingling and pain.

• Recurrent attacks of blistering affecting a mucous membrane site are likely to be caused
by HSV.

• Patients suffering from recurrent attacks of reactivation may require secondary prophylaxis with aciclovir.

A LOCALIZED, PAINFUL, BLISTERING ERUPTION

History
A 69-year-old retired man is referred by his GP to the on-call dermatology registrar with
a 1-week history of increasing pain, erythema and blisters on the left side of his face. He
is unable to open his left eye. Two days prior to the onset of the cutaneous eruption the
patient had complained of pain on swallowing and pain in the left ear and temple area,
when he was prescribed flucloxacillin. He has a history of hypertension and is taking
amlodipine and simvastatin.
Examination
He has marked swelling of the left side of his face with prominent periorbital oedema
(Fig. 75.1). There is a sticky discharge around his left eye. He has multiple vesicles on a
background of erythema with crusting and erosions. There is a small area of ulceration
on the lower lip with multiple ulcers on the hard palate and buccal mucosa. The signs
and symptoms are localized to the left side of his face. His temperature is 37.8 oC, blood
pressure 133/78 mmHg and pulse rate 67 beats/min.

ANSWER 75
This man had herpes zoster virus (HZV) (shingles) affecting the left mandibular branch of
the trigeminal nerve. The first symptom is usually tingling followed by severe pain in the
skin supplied by the affected nerve. Patients feel unwell and may develop localized tender
lymphadenopathy. Within a few days a localized cutaneous eruption occurs in crops of
erythematous papules that rapidly form into blisters which then crust over and heal with
scarring over a few weeks.
The patient will have acquired HZV from a primary chickenpox infection (usually in
childhood) after which the virus remains latent in the spinal dorsal root ganglia. When
the virus is reactivated (most frequently in the elderly) as shingles the cutaneous dermatome supplied by the sensory nerve is affected. In this case the mandibular branch
of the trigeminal nerve was affected resulting in cutaneous/mucocutaneous signs in the
distribution of the nerve (supplying the skin of the temporal region, lower lip and chin,
buccal mucosa, muscles of mastication, mucous membrane of the anterior two-thirds of
the tongue). Sensory nerve involvement is characteristic of shingles; however, 5 per cent
of cases include motor nerve involvement. Multi-dermatomal shingles is seen in immunocompromised patients.
If possible, patients should receive aciclovir within 72 hours of the onset of the cutaneous
eruption. Oral aciclovir is sufficient for the majority of patients (800 mg five times daily
for 7–10 days). However, this patient developed severe oral ulceration and pain on swallowing and therefore was treated with intravenous aciclovir (5 mg/kg body weight, three
times a day) for the first 48 hours of his treatment followed by a further 7 days of oral
therapy. Consider intravenous therapy if there is involvement of the eye, motor nerves
or if the patient is immunocompromised. If motor involvement is severe, consider giving
oral prednisolone in addition to aciclovir.
The cutaneous eruption should be treated topically with an emollient such as 50:50 white
soft paraffin with liquid paraffin (hourly if necessary) to keep the affected skin greasy.
The emollient helps reduce pain in the eroded areas and the likelihood of fissures (skin
splitting) as the blisters crust over. The emollient also acts as a barrier to help prevent
secondary bacterial infection in the denuded areas of skin. Topical antibiotic ointments
may be indicated if secondary infection is suspected. Occasionally oral antibiotics may
be indicated.
This patient was jointly managed with the ophthalmologists who recommended regular
eyelid cleaning with sterile normal saline and chloramphenicol 1% ointment four times
daily to the left eye. Analgesia (such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) should
be given in the acute phase and for post-herpetic neuralgia, which may be severe and
protracted (consider gabapentin or amitriptyline).

KEY POINTS

• Treatment with antiviral drugs should be started as early as possible to improve clinical
outcomes.

• Topical treatment to the skin and affected mucous membranes helps reduce pain and
complications.

• Multi-dermatomal zoster should alert the clinician to a patient with underlying
immunosuppression.

MULTIPLE FLESH-COLOURED PAPULES ON THE FACE

History
A 38-year-old woman is admitted to hospital with
a 6-week history of increasing shortness of breath
on exertion, fever, dry cough, malaise and weight
loss. She also complains of multiple ‘spots’ on her
face and chest, which have become more numerous over the past 2 weeks. Her past medical history
is unremarkable and she has no history of previous
skin problems. She has been taking paracetamol
for her fevers, but otherwise is not on any regular
medication.
Examination
She looks unwell and is breathless at rest, her
temperature is 38.5 ˚C; chest examination reveals
mild crackles in the mid zones only. On her
skin she has multiple, small (2-3 mm in diameter), firm, flesh-coloured papules on her face
(Fig. 76.1) and chest. Many of the papules have
a central umbilicated depression, the surrounding
skin is normal.

Figure 76.1

INVESTIGATIONS
Chest X-ray showed bilateral diffuse patchy infiltrates in the mid zones. Bronchoalveolar
lavage samples were sent for microscopy and culture.

Questions
• What is the skin diagnosis?
• What is the respiratory diagnosis?
• What is the unifying underlying diagnosis?

169

ANSWER 76
When patients present with a cutaneous eruption in association with other signs or
symptoms, the skin can often give a vital clue to the underlying/unifying diagnosis. Skin
can be the ‘window’ to internal disease. This patient had very characteristic skin lesions
of molluscum contagiosum. The flesh-coloured umbilicated papules are caused by a
cutaneous infection with a highly contagious poxvirus. Gently squeezing an individual
lesion characteristically causes the extrusion of semi-solid white material (comprising the
molluscum bodies). Poxvirus is spread by direct contact and autoinoculation is common.
When adults present with multiple lesions, then underlying immune compromise should
be suspected. Molluscum contagiosum in young children is seen in otherwise healthy
individuals.
This patient was found to be HIV-positive with a viral load of 632 000 copies/mL and
a CD4 lymphocyte count of 3. It is estimated that approximately 10 per cent of adult
HIV patients have molluscum contagiosum and that the more widespread the lesions, the
lower their CD4 lymphocyte count.
The patient’s progressive respiratory symptoms were caused by co-infection with
Pneumocystis (carinii) jiroveci and Mycobacterium tuberculosis pneumonia. This dual
respiratory infection is not uncommon in patients from sub-Saharan Africa.
The patient immediately received treatment for her acute pneumonia and tuberculosis
and within a few weeks started on HAART (highly active antiretroviral therapy). After
discharge from hospital she was seen in the dermatology out-patient clinic and had the
molluscum lesions treated fortnightly with cryotherapy (liquid nitrogen). The molluscum
slowly cleared with a combination of cryotherapy and immune reconstitution.
Molluscum contagiosum is usually self-resolving in children and those with an intact
immune system. Inflammation around the lesions is usually seen just prior to their resolution indicating activation of the patient’s own immune system in dealing with the cutaneous infection. Most attempts at treating molluscum lesions revolve around destructive/
irritant methods, such as with acid chemicals, cryotherapy and immunotherapy (topical
imiquimod 5% cream daily).

KEY POINTS

• Multiple molluscum contagiosum lesions in an adult may indicate underlying immunodeficiency.

• Molluscum contagiosum is a poxvirus spread by direct contact and is not uncommon in
children.

• Molluscum is self-resolving, but locally destructive treatments may speed resolution.

CASE 77:

MULTIPLE HYPERKERATOTIC PAPULES AND NODULES
ON THE FINGERS

History
A 51-year-old patient under the care of the haematologists is referred to the dermatology clinic with a 6-year history of multiple papules and nodules on her fingers. The
lesions have slowly been increasing in size and number over the last two years and are
mainly asymptomatic. The lesions were treated with liquid nitrogen by her GP but they
were unresponsive. She had been diagnosed two years previously with stage B chronic
lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL). She has received several courses of chlorambucil, fludarabine and cyclophosphamide to which she partially responded and is being considered for
alemtuzumab (Campath – antiCD52) biological therapy in the future.
Examination
She has multiple hyperkeratotic flesh-coloured papules and nodules, mainly over the
dorsi of her fingers and hands (Fig. 77.1) The lesions are warty in nature and firm on
palpation. The surrounding skin is normal.
INVESTIGATIONS
At the time of review in the dermatology clinic, blood counts were normal.

Questions
• Why does she have multiple lesions on
her hands?
• What treatment options are possible
for her skin lesions?

Figure 77.1

171

ANSWER 77
This woman has been suffering from multiple viral warts on her hands for many years.
The warts result from an infection with human papilloma virus (HPV) in the cutaneous keratinocytes. HPV is specific to humans and is passed by direct skin contact and
through fomites. HPV infects the basal keratinocytes; when these infected cells leave
the basal layer they become highly differentiated, triggering viral genome replication.
Consequently, when the keratinocytes reach the epithelial surface, viral particles are
released with the sloughed-off cells into the environment where they can survive for
many months.
HPV infections are common in the general population but are more frequently found
in patients who are immunosuppressed, when warts are often multiple. CLL causes
down-regulation of immune surveillance and an increased susceptibility to all manner
of infections. In addition, chemotherapy depletes patients’ white cell populations rendering them more vulnerable to infections. These patients are unable to clear the HPV and
subsequently develop multiple recalcitrant warts.
Although cutaneous warts are not harmful in themselves they can cause a considerable
amount of distress to patients both psychologically and socially. Patients frequently feel
embarrassed by their warts and can often feel stigmatized by others.
Most treatments for HPV are locally destructive (cryotherapy with liquid nitrogen, salicylic acid, electrodessication, CO2 laser) and then the host’s immune cells ‘mop-up’ the
residual virus released; however, when the host’s immune system is suboptimal, locally
destructive treatments are frequently ineffective.
Although not licensed to treat cutaneous warts, treatment options include immunotherapy with imiquimod 5% cream (daily with Elastoplast occlusion) or diphencyprone (DPC)
fortnightly. DPC is a highly sensitizing chemical – patients are rendered allergic to it by
painting a small amount on their forearm skin, then increasing percentages are applied
directly to the warts to recruit immune cells into the local tissue. Cure rates of 60 per cent
are reported in immunosuppressed patients after 6 months of treatment. This patient was
treated with DPC immunotherapy to good effect. Topical bleomycin has also been used
with some success to treat recalcitrant warts in this group of patients.
KEY POINTS

• If a patient presents with multiple HPV warts, then consider immune deficiency.
• Warts will eventually resolve spontaneously in the majority of patients.
• Management of warts includes local destructive modalities and immunotherapy to the skin.

CASE 78:

SUDDEN-ONSET MACULOPAPULAR RASH WITH
CONJUNCTIVITIS AND MALAISE

History
A 42-year-old woman presents to the accident and emergency department with a 1-week
history of malaise and a widespread rash that started on her face and spread distally.
In addition she complains of a temperature, vomiting, diarrhoea, productive cough and
painful red eyes. She has just finished a course of amoxicillin for recurrent sinusitis. Her
two young children have recently had a viral illness with a rash. She was previously well
with no underlying medical problems. She is admitted to a side room and referred to the
dermatology team.
Examination
The patient is pyrexial with a temperature of 39.4 ˚C. She has an extensive erythematous maculopapular eruption, which is particularly marked on her face, neck and
trunk (Fig. 78.1). Some of the papules are coalescing into plaques with central bullae.
Examination of her mouth reveals marked erythema with prominent white spots on her
palate and buccal mucosae (Fig. 78.2). Her conjunctivae are erythematous and injected.
INVESTIGATIONS
Chest X-ray showed right lower lobe consolidation.
Viral serology and oral fluid tests, sputum culture and skin biopsy were performed.

Figure 78.1

Figure 78.2

Questions
• What is the most likely diagnosis and possible complication?
• How would you confirm the diagnosis?
• Who else may need some form of treatment and what form should that take?

173

ANSWER 78
This woman was obviously unwell on admission. A viral illness was suspected but a possible reaction to amoxicillin was also considered. Oral fluid swab and serology confirmed
a diagnosis of measles. Her two children had recently had a viral illness that was subsequently confirmed as measles. The patient herself had been partially vaccinated with
MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine as a child. Measles is highly contagious and passes readily among contacts through droplet spread; the incubation period is 1–2 weeks.
Patients frequently experience a prodrome of fever and malaise with photophobia and
conjunctivitis. White Koplik’s spots on the buccal mucosa/palate are virtually pathognomonic, but not always present. The cutaneous eruption usually appears within days of
the onset of symptoms, first appearing behind the ears and then spreading caudally. The
rash is erythematous and mainly macular but can develop papules, which may coalesce
and blister. Complications include otitis media, encephalitis and bronchopneumonia. This
patient developed a chest infection as a complication of her measles; sputum culture grew
Haemophilus influenzae.
Oral fluid can be collected using a foam swab and sent to the virology laboratory for
rapid diagnosis of measles via RNA detection tests. IgM antibodies to measles can be
detected around day 4 after the onset of the rash (90–100 per cent sensitivity) and up to
3 months thereafter. Mid-stream urine, nasopharyngeal and conjunctival swabs can also
be taken to confirm the presence of measles virus.
Management of measles is largely supportive and patients should be isolated, so they
don’t transmit this highly infectious disease; however, patients may need admitting to
hospital for treatment of any serious complications that may arise. Close contacts of those
infected with measles are likely to develop the disease if they are not immune (through
vaccination or previous infection). Measles is a notifiable disease in the United Kingdom
so the local Consultant for Communicable Diseases should be informed.
Young children who have not yet been vaccinated but who have been exposed to measles
can be given two doses of live attenuated MMR vaccine to try to prevent disease onset.
Vitamin A supplementation during the acute illness has been shown to reduce morbidity
and mortality.

KEY POINTS

• Measles is highly contagious; patients are infectious 2 days prior to the onset of the rash.
• The maculopapular and erythematous rash spreads in a cephalocaudal direction.
• Patients with severe complications of measles may need treatment in hospital.

CASE 79:

CROPS OF BLISTERS BECOMING WIDESPREAD IN A
CHILD WITH GASTROINTESTINAL UPSET

History
A 3-year-old boy is noted by his parents to have two small erythematous papules on his
abdomen just before bedtime. The next morning he feels hot and has developed multiple
lesions over his trunk, some of which look like blisters. Later that day he develops vomiting and diarrhoea and his parents take him to the accident and emergency department.
The child has previously been well and attends nursery four days per week. No other
family members are obviously affected. His mother feels tired as she is currently 12 weeks
pregnant with her third child.
Examination
The child feels hot and looks slightly miserable, he does not obviously look dehydrated. There are multiple erythematous papules and vesicles over the child’s abdomen
(Fig. 79.1), back and around his neck. Most of the vesicles are intact, however some have
ruptured and are starting to crust. There are a few excoriation marks around his neck.
Mucous membranes are normal.

Questions
• What would be your first course of
action?
• What is the most likely diagnosis?
• What investigations might be required?
• What treatment should be offered and
to whom?

Figure 79.1

175

ANSWER 79
Chickenpox caused by varicella zoster virus (VZV) is a common, highly contagious infectious disease that usually affects young children. In the United States children are vaccinated against VZV to try to prevent the disease, however this is not routinely given in
the United Kingdom as the disease is considered mild. It is also thought that the lower
rates of shingles (latent reactivation of VZV in the skin) in adults who themselves had
chickenpox as a child results from chronic exposure to the virus through contact with
infected individuals. The virus is spread by droplets from the respiratory tract and from
infected blister fluid (of chickenpox and shingles). There is usually a history of contact with another person with chickenpox/shingles 21 days before symptoms and signs
develop. Patients are contagious 2 days prior to the onset of the rash and until all the
lesions have completed crusted over.
Chickenpox can cause mild choryzal symptoms, headache, fever and even diarrhoea and
vomiting. Small erythematous papules appear in clusters usually on the abdomen initially
and then form blisters that appear in crops over a few days spreading outwards across
the trunk and limbs. The lesions are classically at different stages: some papules, some
blisters, and some crusted lesions starting to heal over. The eruption is usually itchy
and many children scratch the tops off the vesicles, which can lead to scars that may be
atrophic or keloid.
The first action you should take if assessing a child with potential chickenpox is to move
out of the general waiting area/communal areas into a side room. VZV can be potentially
serious if transmitted to non-immune, immunocompromised and pregnant individuals. It
is important in this case to ascertain if the mother herself has previously had chickenpox
as she is currently 12 weeks pregnant. Serology tests can look for rising titres of antibodies to VZV (IgM) in active disease and signs of life-long immunity (IgG) to VZV. Blister
fluid can be analysed by polymerase chain reaction for the virus in those with the rash.
VZV acquisition in pregnancy can lead to maternal pneumonia, premature labour, and
even maternal death. Fetuses and newborns infected with primary VZV often develop
very severe disease. Non-immune pregnant women exposed to VZV should be given
varicella zoster immune globulin within 96 hours of exposure.
Children with severe chickenpox – that is, 300–500 lesions on a background of atopic
eczema – may occasionally need treatment with aciclovir. Mild topical steroids should be
restarted once the lesions are starting to crust over to help reduce inflammation, exacerbation of eczema and possible scarring. VZV remains latent in the body for life in the
sensory dorsal root ganglion where reactivation results in shingles in distribution of the
sensory cutaneous nerve (dermatome). Acute shingles can be very painful and even after
healing can result in post-herpetic neuralgia.
KEY POINTS

• Chickenpox is caused by exposure to VSV and has an incubation period of 21 days.
• Crops of blisters appear on the trunk over several days.
• Non-immune at-risk individuals (pregnancy, immunocompromised) exposed to VZV
may need aciclovir or zoster immune globulin.

CASE 80:

MULTIPLE CUTANEOUS BOILS APPEARING OVER
12 MONTHS

History
A 54-year-old man with a 1-year history of multiple skin boils is seen in the dermatology clinic.
These had started within two months of returning
from India. The lesions first appeared as small red
nodules, which increased in size and became painful before discharging pus. The lesions seemed to
heal slowly, leaving scars. New lesions would then
appear every few weeks. He has taken numerous
courses of antibiotics from his GP, which seemed
partially helpful, and has required incision and
drainage of some of the larger, more painful furuncles. His wife, who is a nurse working in the local
orthopaedics department, does not have any skin
problems. The patient has a history of inflammatory
bowel disease but is otherwise well and not taking
any regular medications.
Examination
Multiple actively discharging boils and furuncles are
seen on the right side of his chest with scarred areas
from healed lesions (Fig. 80.1). He has a few boils
elsewhere: on his left hip, and neck. There are palpable lymph nodes in the right axilla. Examination
is otherwise unremarkable and his temperature is
37 oC.

Figure 80.1

INVESTIGATIONS
A swab was taken from the pus and carrier sites (nose, axilla, groin, throat) for
microbiological analysis. Full blood count was normal.

Questions
• What organism is most likely the cause of his boils?
• Why might the boils not clear up with conventional systemic antibiotics?
• What special microbiological test would you request?

177

ANSWER 80
Recurrent recalcitrant boils caused by the bacterium Staphylococcus aureus are usually
seen in young to middle-aged adults. Conventional treatment of large/painful furuncles
is incision and drainage with 2 weeks of oral antibiotics. This patient, however, did not
respond to this traditional approach. Pus from the active boils taken by the GP cultured
methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) – this was a hospital-acquired rather
than the community-acquired type of MRSA.
Subsequently, swabs were taken in the dermatology department from the active lesions as
well as his carrier sites and sent to the microbiology department with a special request for
gene detection studies to look for S. aureus with the virulence factor Panton Valentine
leukocidin (PVL). Microbiology results showed the patient to have MRSA and PVLpositive S. aureus in the boils and up his nose.
PVL is a virulence factor that is acquired by certain strains of S. aureus rendering them
difficult to kill by conventional antibiotic treatment regimens. Not all strains that are
PVL-positive are also resistant. In fact most are fully sensitive to methicillin; however
bacteria that are resistant and virulent are very recalcitrant clinically and therapeutically,
as in this case.
This patient may have acquired his PVL-positive S. aureus whilst travelling in India –
travel is a risk factor for acquiring this virulent strain, as are contact sports and keeping
pets. There was no direct evidence that the patient acquired the bacteria from his wife
(who worked in hospitals) as her swabs were all negative. Nonetheless there is evidence
that PVL-positive strains of S. aureus are also highly transmissible and this is thought to
play a role in multiple family/team members being simultaneously affected.
Treatment for PVL-positive S. aureus is similar to treatment for MRSA, in that patients
require decontamination therapy alongside systemic antibiotics. This patient was treated
with nasal mupirocin three times a day for 5 days up each nostril. He was asked to wash
daily with Hibiscrub (4% chlorhexidine). He was asked to take rifampicin and clindamycin 300 mg twice daily for 10 weeks. All the lesions healed and no new lesions appeared.
Follow-up swabs from all sites were negative.
In patients with PVL-positive S. aureus that is fully sensitive to methicillin, a prolonged
course of high-dose flucloxacillin plus decontamination may be sufficient to clear the
infection. Asymptomatic family members should be swabbed, and if found to be positive
at their carrier sites should also undergo decontamination.

KEY POINTS

• Consider virulent strains of Staphylococcus aureus in patients with severe or recurrent
boils.

• Ask your microbiologist to undertake special gene detection tests on S. aureus isolates
to look for PVL.

• Patients should undertake decontamination with nasal antibiotic, antiseptic wash and
prolonged courses of systemic antibiotics.

CHRONIC, SORE, MACERATED SKIN IN THE
FINGER WEBS

History
A 46-year-old housewife with known multisystem sarcoidosis comes for a regular
follow-up visit to the dermatology clinic. She complains of an increasing number of
asymptomatic skin lesions on her limbs. She also mentions soreness between her fingers
where the skin has started to break down. She had become increasingly breathless over
the past two months and after consultation with the respiratory team she was commenced
on a slowly reducing course of oral prednisolone and is currently taking 30 mg daily. Her
past medical history includes hypothyroidism and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura.
Examination
She is slightly breathless at rest and looks mildly cushingoid. The skin between her fingers is erythematous with superficial white maceration (Fig. 81.1) and ulceration forming
deep fissures (Fig. 81.2). In addition she has indurated, slightly hyperpigmented nodules
and plaques on her limbs.

Questions
• What is the likely underlying cause of the skin changes in the finger webs?
• What is the cause of the cutaneous lesions on this patient’s limbs?
• How would you manage her skin?
179

ANSWER 81
This patient has multiple, indurated, asymptomatic nodules and plaques of cutaneous sarcoidosis on her limbs. She had been taking systemic corticosteroids for her deteriorating
respiratory sarcoid. This iatrogenic immunosuppression had left the patient vulnerable
to infection. She developed a Candida albicans intertrigo in her finger webs (confirmed
by yeast culture from her skin swab). This presentation is occasionally referred to as
erosio interdigitalis blastomycetica (interdigital candidosis) and can be associated with
occupations requiring frequent ‘wet work’ such as housework and gardening. Clinically,
this superficial yeast infection is characterized by erythema, maceration and peeling of
the flexural skin between the fingers. So-called ‘satellite lesions’ can often be seen as
small erythematous papules/pustules at the periphery of the area of yeast-infected skin.
Candida prefers a warm moist environment and hence the most commonly affected skin
sites include the groin, natal cleft, axillae, under the breasts and between the digits.
C. albicans yeast forms part of normal human flora, with reservoirs in the gastrointestinal
tract and vagina. C. albicans is not part of the normal skin flora, however it can transiently colonize flexural areas. The fine balance between the patient’s immune system and
yeast numbers can be easily upset by minor changes in the local skin environment, use
of antibiotics, raised serum glucose and immune compromise through disease or medications leading to active candidiasis of the skin.
Management of Candida intertrigo includes trying to ensure the skin is kept as dry as
possible to make the local skin environmentally hostile to the yeast. This can be achieved
by using drying soaks such as potassium permanganate, antifungal powders and acetic
acid. Antifungal treatments can be given orally or applied topically. Many dermatologists
will try to manage localized disease with a topical combination antifungal cream plus
anti-inflammatory steroid. Short courses of oral fluconazole or itraconazole may, however, be required in patients who are immunosuppressed or who have recalcitrant disease.
This patient needed to remain on her systemic corticosteroids and therefore oral fluconazole was given to try to help eliminate the Candida intertrigo over a few weeks. In addition she was asked to wash her hands once daily in chlorhexidine and to apply Canestan
cream twice daily. This type of infection can take several weeks to clear, particularly in
patients who are diabetic or immunosuppressed.

KEY POINTS

• Cutaneous Candida infections should be suspected in flexural skin with erythema and
maceration.

• Candida yeasts more frequently cause skin disease in patients who are vulnerable such
as neonates, the immunocompromised and the elderly.

• Combination treatment with skin drying agents, antifungals and topical steroids are effective.

ASYMPTOMATIC PURPLE SKIN LESIONS APPEARING
ON THE LIMBS AND TRUNK

History
A 56-year-old Albanian man presents to the dermatology clinic with a 2-year history of
developing asymptomatic purple lesions on his skin. The initial lesions appeared on his
feet 4 months after an orthoptic liver transplant for hepatitis B. Over the past few months
he has developed further cutaneous lesions on his legs, arms and trunk. He is taking
systemic prednisolone and tacrolimus.
Examination
There are well-demarcated macular purple patches on his shoulder, forearms, dorsi of his
hands, right calf and left foot. The lesions on the left foot and medial shin are indurated,
firm plaques (Fig. 82.1). The mouth, genitals, scalp and nails are normal.
INVESTIGATIONS
A skin biopsy was taken from a lesion on the left foot.
An HIV test was carried out.
A computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest was performed.

Questions
• What is the cause of the skin lesions?
• What is the aetiological agent?
• How would you manage this patient?

Figure 82.1

181

ANSWER 82
Cutaneous lesions with a vascular origin frequently appear as purple discolouration,
including purpura, vasculitis, livedo, vascular occlusion (thrombosis) and vascular proliferations (benign or malignant). When blood vessels proliferate there may be a palpable
component to the skin lesions such as papules, patches, plaques or nodules.
This Albanian patient presented with multiple, asymptomatic, palpable, purple skin
lesions on a background of immunosuppression, leading to a clinical diagnosis of
Kaposi’s sarcoma (KS). This was confirmed histologically by taking a skin biopsy. The histopathology showed the classic spindle cells surrounding slit-like spaces with red blood
cells; staining for human herpes virus type 8 (HHV-8) was positive.
This patient’s HIV test was negative, and he was therefore diagnosed with disseminated
endemic KS. The immunosuppressive medication he was taking for his liver transplant
had allowed the proliferation of KS-associated herpes virus (thought to be HHV-8) leading to the development of clinical KS lesions. In the context of transplantation these
patients are thought to harbour the latent oncogenic herpes virus, which then reactivates
leading to the development of malignant vascular tumours. KS classically affects the skin
but mucosal tissue and systemic involvement may also occur. This patient’s CT scan was
negative for KS lesions in the lung.
So-called iatrogenic KS in liver and renal transplant patients poses a therapeutic challenge. The tumour is chemosensitive and radiosensitive. However, in the context of transplantation, adjustment to the immunosuppressive medication can be highly successful.
This patient was switched from tacrolimus to sirolimus (rapamycin) with regression of the
tumours. Sirolimus is immunosuppressive and has anti-tumour properties.
Recent evidence from laboratory studies has shown that the tumour is stimulated by iron
salts. Transplant recipients often receive multiple blood transfusions leading to possible
iron overload, and consequently leave them more susceptible to KS than other iatrogenically immunosuppressed patients.

KEY POINTS

• Kaposi’s sarcoma (KS) is a malignant vascular tumour that occurs in endemic areas, in
HIV carriers and organ transplant recipients.

• Immunohistochemical staining for HHV-8 is positive from KS lesions.
• KS in transplant patients can be managed by adjusting the immunosuppressive medication.

CASE 83:

WIDESPREAD ITCHY ERUPTION PREVENTING SLEEP

History
A 20-year-old man presents to his GP with an intensely pruritic eruption. He is finding
that the itching is keeping him awake at night, and consequently it is hard to concentrate
in his college exams. He has come to the GP to ask for a sick note. One of his housemates
has also recently become itchy and they had begun to suspect their student flat may have
an infestation of some sort. He was previously well and takes no regular medication. The
patient had applied calamine lotion on the rash as recommended by his local chemist,
with little relief.
Examination
There are multiple erythematous papules and excoriations over his limbs and trunk,
which are particularly severe over his hands (Fig. 83.1) and on his genital area. There are
some very subtle, palpable linear marks running along the sides of his fingers. His scalp,
nails and mouth are normal.

Questions
• What is the most likely diagnosis?
• Should the pest control team be requested
to visit their flat?
• Who should be treated and with what?

Figure 83.1

183

ANSWER 83
There are few pruritic skin eruptions that keep patients awake at night and usually this is
highly suggestive of a scabies infestation. The human mite Sarcoptes scabiei is passed from
one individual to another, usually by direct skin contact but also through contact with
fomites such as bedding and towels. The female parasitic mite that burrows into the skin can
only live away from the human host for 1–2 days in the environment. Once the infestation
has been transmitted there is a delay of about six weeks before the onset of pruritus, which is
a type IV delayed hypersensitivity reaction to the proteins in the mites/eggs/faeces. However,
symptoms of pruritus in subsequent infestations can start within days as the individual is
already ‘primed’ to the protein. Several individuals in the same household may be infested
simultaneously, especially if living in overcrowded or poor quality accommodation.
Approximately 10 adult females in burrows are present in the human skin during a scabies infestation, and consequently the burrows themselves may be difficult to identify.
They are linear wandering lesions, usually most easily seen in the web-spaces of the
fingers and on the genitalia. If you look closely with a magnifying lens/dermatoscope
you may just see a small black ‘speck’ (the mite)
at the advancing edge. The remainder of the skin
rash consists mainly of erythematous papules
and excoriation marks, which reflects a pruritic
allergic-type hypersensitivity eruption. Babies
have a slightly different clinical presentation in
that lesions may look more like blisters and they
are particularly common on the soles of the feet
(Fig. 83.2) and in the axillae, which should help
Figure 83.2
to distinguish scabies from atopic dermatitis.
Crusted scabies occurs in individuals who have thousands of mites in their infestation
such that the skin looks as if it has crust or fine scale on the surface. These individuals
may be in a poor state of health with a suboptimally functioning immune system.
Infested individuals and all close contacts should be treated with topical permethrin 5%
lotion applied to all the skin from the neck downwards (babies should have the face/neck
and scalp areas also treated). The treatment should be left on overnight, washed off in
the morning and repeated after 7 days as the treatment is not ovicidal. Patients who are
immunosuppressed or who have crusted scabies (avoid in children < 5 years old and in
pregnancy) can be treated with oral ivermectin 200 μg/kg body weight in 2 doses two
weeks apart. Both topical and oral treatments are highly effective. Apparent treatment
failures usually result from not all close contacts being treated simultaneously.
The pruritus will continue for approximately 4–6 weeks after successful treatment of the
infestation, as this is the time needed for the body to degrade and remove all the mite protein in the skin. Post-scabies treatment therefore consists of soothing anti-itch emollients
such as menthol in aqueous cream, and topical steroids can help to alleviate symptoms.
KEY POINTS

• The pruritus caused by a scabies infestation keeps patients awake at night.
• A detailed history concerning similarly affected household members is helpful in making
a diagnosis.

• All close contacts should be treated simultaneously to ensure successful eradication of
the mite.

CASE 84:

PAINLESS ERYTHEMATOUS LESION ON THE NOSE
GROWS OVER FOUR MONTHS

History
A 28-year-old Turkish Cypriot man came to the United Kingdom to visit relatives for a
few months. During his visit he noticed that a small erythematous lesion on his nose was
increasing in size and his relatives brought him to the accident and emergency department.
He is referred to the dermatology team for an opinion. The lesion is asymptomatic and
has been growing slowly over a period of four months. In Cyprus, where he works in the
construction industry, he did not recall any history of trauma to the affected area during
his work. He does not burn in the sun and is tanned relatively easily. He is otherwise well,
and takes no regular medication.

Examination
There is an erythematous nodule at the root of the nose; the overlying epidermis is normal but there is an indurated swelling in the dermis which is firm on palpation (Fig. 84.1).
There is no ulceration or evidence of telangiectasia within the lesion. Examination of his
mucous membranes is normal, there is no regional lymphadenopathy or organomegaly.
He has a BCG vaccination scar on his upper left arm, the rest of his skin check is normal.
INVESTIGATIONS
A skin biopsy was taken for histology, culture and analysis by polymerase chain reaction
(PCR). Full blood count was normal.

Figure 84.1

Questions
• What is the most likely clinical diagnosis?
• What would you expect the culture and PCR analysis to show?
• How would you manage this patient?

185

ANSWER 84
The skin histopathology from the lesion showed ill-defined granulomas with lymphocytes,
plasma cells and eosinophils, there was no evidence of vasculitis. Special stains for microorganisms were negative. The differential diagnoses of cutaneous granulomas include
sarcoidosis, tuberculosis, deep fungal infections, leishmaniasis, foreign body reactions,
granuloma annulare and granuloma faciale. Microbiological culture from lesional skin
grew Leishmania protozoan parasites. PCR confirmed the species Leishmania donovanii
complex. The patient was therefore diagnosed with cutaneous leishmaniasis.
There are many different species of Leishmania, each confined to a geographical region
of the world and transmitted by the bite of the female sandfly vector. Bites usually occur
at night on exposed skin and are not normally painful, therefore patients rarely recall
being bitten. Leishmaniasis acquired in Cyprus – so-called ‘old world’ leishmaniasis – can
result in cutaneous or mucocutaneous disease.
At the site of the sandfly bite, classically, a small erythematous non-painful papule forms.
Over a few months the lesion increases in size into a nodule that may ulcerate. Localized
cutaneous leishmaniasis is usually a self-limiting disease with most lesions healing within
5–15 months. Lesions usually heal with scarring. Treatment aims are to heal lesions more
rapidly and try to reduce scarring. In resource-poor settings cryotherapy or heat therapy
can be successfully used; however, if available, intra-lesional stibogluconate is highly
effective. This pentavalent antimony-containing compound is injected into the lesion
at weekly intervals for a few weeks. This patient received five injections over a 6-week
period, causing clinical resolution with minimal scarring.
Patients with mucocutaneous or visceral leishmaniasis may be quite unwell with a temperature and malaise. Visceral involvement can lead to a depressed bone marrow (anaemia, leucopenia and thrombocytopenia) and hepatosplenomegaly. Such patients require
systemic treatment with intravenous stibogluconate (20–40 days) or intramuscular pentamidine (10 injections given on alternate days) both of which have challenging side-effect
profiles. Liposomal amphotericin B (3 mg/kg per day for 5 days plus a further treatment
after 1 week) can be effective and is reasonably well tolerated.

KEY POINTS

• Cutaneous leishmaniasis occurs at the site of a sandfly bite, usually on exposed skin.
• Histopathology and culture from involved skin can confirm the diagnosis; however, PCR
is highly specific for species identification.

• Identifying the species of Leishmania involved is important as this guides therapy,
whether topical or systemic.

CASE 85:

SCALING OF THE SCALP WITH OCCIPITAL
LYMPHADENOPATHY IN A CHILD

History
A 4-year-old boy is referred from the accident and emergency department to the paediatric dermatology clinic, owing to a 1-year history of scaling and crusting of his scalp
associated with hair loss. Despite numerous courses of oral antibiotics and topical antifungal creams the eruption had become progressively worse over the last few months. No
one else at home is obviously affected. The child is otherwise well.
Examination
The patient is accompanied by his parents and
older sibling. There are obvious patches of
alopecia over the vertex of his scalp associated
with scaling and crusting (Fig. 85.1). The skin
is inflamed and erythematous in the affected
areas. There is marked occipital lymphadenopathy. The rest of his skin and nails look normal. Examination of his older sibling reveals a
diffusely scaly scalp, but no alopecia or lymphadenopathy. The patient’s mother is noted
to have a scaly annular lesion on her anterior
neck, both parents’ scalps look normal.

Figure 85.1

INVESTIGATIONS
The whole family had scalp brushings taken for mycological culture. A scraping for
mycological microscopy and culture was also taken from the lesion on the mother’s neck.

The patient was started on oral therapy daily plus a shampoo, but within five days he had
developed a widespread itchy papular rash (Fig. 85.2) and returned to the dermatology clinic.

Questions
• What disease is affecting the patient’s
scalp and what is the cause of his widespread rash?
• Which members of the family would
you treat and with what agents?
• Is the patient’s hair likely to grow back?

Figure 85.2
187

ANSWER 85
This boy presents with a very common scalp complaint of children seen in most urban
areas. He is suffering from tinea capitis (scalp ‘ringworm’) which is a dermatophyte fungal
infection. The clinical appearances can be highly variable from marked scaling, crusting,
pustules and papules to a frank inflammatory boggy swelling (kerion) with alopecia, to subtle fine diffuse scale only. Children frequently have associated occipital lymphadenopathy.
After starting oral antifungal medication the patient developed a classic pruritic papular
‘id’ reaction which is an immunological reaction to the infection that can coincide with
the start of treatment. It is not an allergy to the antifungal treatment as is frequently
assumed. The ‘id’ reaction can be managed with mild topical steroids and emollients. The
oral antifungals should be continued.
The fungus is spread from child to child in schools and between family members at home.
Frequently, parents’ scalps are spared, however they may develop cutaneous lesions (tinea
corporis), especially on their neck and upper trunk where the child’s head comes to rest
whilst sitting on the parent’s lap.
Trichophyton tonsurans is an anthropophilic (human) species, which is most commonly
isolated from the mycological culture. The fungal hyphae of T. tonsurans penetrate into
the hair shaft (endothrix) rendering topical therapy ineffective. Therefore, systemic treatment is required to clear the scalp infection. Screening of family members by taking
scalp brushings is recommended as tinea capitis may be very subtle clinically. Mycology
cultures can take 6–8 weeks, as the fungus grows slowly; consequently, treatment may
need to be started in the first instance on clinical grounds.
Traditionally, children with tinea capitis were treated with oral griseofulvin, however to
eradicate T. tonsurans high doses are required for up to two months. Oral terbinafine is
therefore the treatment of choice in many paediatric dermatology clinics, as it is highly
effective and well tolerated. As yet, oral terbinafine is not licensed in children in the UK.
Oral terbinafine is given to children daily for 1 month according to their weight: < 20 kg,
62.5 mg; 20–40 kg, 125 mg; > 40 kg, 250 mg. It is good clinical practice to re-brush the
scalp after treatment to ensure that there is a mycological as well as clinical cure.
In this case the two children should be treated with oral antifungal medicine and their
mother given topical terbinafine 1% cream to treat her tinea corporis. It is a good idea
to ask all the family members to use an antifungal shampoo once/twice weekly to reduce
the spread of fungus during the treatment course.
Fortunately, the alopecia has a very high chance of complete recovery after treatment,
even after a highly inflammatory kerion.

KEY POINTS

• Clinical features of tinea capitis are highly variable, from mild diffuse scale to pustules
and swelling.

• Affected children and their close contacts should be screened for tinea capitis by scalp
brushings.

• Systemic antifungals should be given, as the majority of cases are caused by endothrix
fungi.

CASE 86:

A PRURITIC ANNULAR RASH AND FAMILY
INVOLVEMENT

History
A 37-year-old healthcare assistant presents to the dermatology clinic with a pruritic eruption over her right knee. The lesion had started as a small erythematous papule and then
spread out very gradually to form a scaly, ring-shaped lesion. The itching is not intense
but she does find herself scratching. She has no history of previous skin problems. Her
7-year-old son has eczema and a dry scaly scalp. She has used some of her son’s cortisone
ointment on the lesion, which seemed to reduce the itching and scaling but the lesion
has continued to expand.
Examination
There is an annular lesion 9 cm in diameter with a raised edge over the right knee
(Fig. 86.1). Marked hyperpigmentation, erythema and multiple papules and pustules are
seen at the raised edge. Her scalp and nails are normal, as is the rest of her skin. She has
brought her son with her to the clinic; he has a very scaly scalp with patches of alopecia
and occipital lymphadenopathy.
INVESTIGATIONS
Mycology scrapings from the edge of the right knee lesion were examined by microscopy
(fungal hyphae were seen), and tissue culture (result: Trichophyton tonsurans)
Mycology brushings from the son’s scalp were examined by tissue culture (result: T. tonsurans)

Questions
• What is the diagnosis?
• From whom did the patient acquire the
infection?
• How would you treat the mother and
child?

Figure 86.1

189

ANSWER 86
The healthcare assistant has a cutaneous fungal infection caused by the dermatophyte
Trichophyton tonsurans. The patient had used a cortisone ointment on the fungal infection
which altered the cutaneous appearance. This phenomenon is so-called ‘tinea incognito’
(steroid-modified tinea), whereby the fungal infection continues to spread outwards but
the scale is reduced and small papules and pustules may appear at the growing margin.
T. tonsurans is the main cause of tinea capitis
(scalp ‘ringworm’) in children living in urban areas.
The fungus is anthropophilic – that is, passed
between humans. The usual cutaneous manifestation of tinea corporis (i.e. not treated with topical
corticosteroid) is shown in Figure 86.2. The classic
presentation includes annular lesions that are scaly
at the edge with central clearing; the eruption is
mildly pruritic.

Figure 86.2

The patient’s son had tinea capitis, which is the
most likely source of the infection. T. tonsurans is
likely to spread to adults when the infected child’s
head comes into direct contact with the adults’ skin,
usually on the neck / anterior chest where a child’s
head rests whilst sitting on their lap. If an adult
presents with a T. tonsurans, ask about contact
with children.

Samples for mycology are very easy to take and results are useful in guiding treatment.
Skin scrapings can be taken using a blunt scalpel blade from the active edge of the
lesions. Samples should be sent to the laboratory in folded coloured paper. Scalp brushings can be taken using plastic sterile disposable travel toothbrushes, using brisk brushing
movements back and forth across the scalp. Brush siblings and parents.

!

Clues to the diagnosis of tinea corporis
• The skin site affected – fungi often prefer the flexures (groin/axillae)
• The eruption will often be asymmetrical – unlike many inflammatory dermatoses
such as psoriasis and eczema
• Concomitant fungal nail infection – onychomycosis
• Underlying diseases – such as diabetes, immunosupression
• Others at home are affected – especially children with tinea capitis
• Worsening with use of topical steroid

T. tonsurans is an endothrix fungus, which means that the fungal spores reside inside the
hair shaft; consequently, scalp infections need to be managed with systemic antifungal
medications. In the past, griseofulvin was used to treat tinea capitis in children at a dose
of 10 mg/kg daily for 6–8 weeks, however one month of terbinafine is equally effective
and better tolerated at a daily dose depending on the child’s weight:  20 kg, 62.5 mg;
20–40 kg, 125 mg;  40 kg, 250 mg. Tinea corporis can be managed with topical terbinafine 1% cream used twice daily for 4-6 weeks. Alternatives are oral terbinafine 250 mg
daily for 2 weeks or oral itraconazole 400 mg daily for 1 week.
190

KEY POINTS

• A cutaneous fungal infection should be suspected in a patient with isolated scaly
annular lesions.

• Classical signs of tinea can be altered by topical steroid use or secondary bacterial
infection.

• Tinea capitis in urban areas is most frequently caused by endothrix fungal species that
require systemic therapy.

PROGRESSIVE SCALING OF THE PALMS AND
DYSTROPHY OF THE FINGERNAILS

History
A dermatology opinion is sought for a 47-year-old in-patient on the haematology ward.
He has noticed slowly progressive redness and scaling of his feet and left palm, which
is minimally itchy. In addition he has extensive discolouration and brittleness of his
toenails and fingernails of the left hand. He had first noticed the skin and nail changes
4 months previously. There is no family or personal history of skin/nail problems. He is
currently an in-patient, having undergone an autologous stem cell transplantation for
multiple myeloma associated with systemic amyloidosis. Prior to the transplant he had
been receiving high-dose melphalan.
Examination
The skin on the soles of his feet and left palm is erythematous with scaling and desquamation. Nail plates are dystrophic and brittle distally, Beau’s lines are evident (horizontal
indentation of the nail plates) and there is associated periungal erythema (Fig. 87.1).

Nail clippings and skin scrapings were taken for microscopy and tissue culture.

Questions
• What is the likely cause of the skin and
nail abnormalities?
• What treatment could be offered?

Figure 87.1

193

ANSWER 87
Skin scaling on the hand/foot and nail dystrophy can be associated with palmar–plantar
psoriasis, severe pompholyx eczema, or dermatophyte (fungal) infections. As a general rule cutaneous inflammatory disorders are more likely to present in a symmetrical
fashion than infections. This patient had been receiving chemotherapy and a stem cell
transplantation, and therefore had undergone a prolonged period of immunosuppression,
which had left him vulnerable to infections.
Nail clippings and skin scrapings were sent for mycological analysis. Fungal hyphae were
seen on microscopy and cultures from skin and nails grew Trichophyton rubrum.
Dermatophyte fungi invade the epidermis and keratinized tissues of the skin, nails and
hair. Adults are more susceptible than children to tinea pedis (athlete’s foot) and onychomycosis (fungal nail infection). It is estimated that about 3–8 per cent of the adult
population is affected by onychomycosis. In diabetic patients and those who are immunosuppressed the incidence is higher.
Invasion of the nail plate distally and laterally usually follows chronic tinea pedis. As
fungi penetrate through the nail plate it lifts up off the nail bed – so-called onycholysis.
The nail plate itself becomes brittle, discoloured and may become hyperkeratotic. The
most common fungi implicated in onychomycosis in Europe include T. rubrum, T. interdigitale, T. tonsurans and Candida albicans.
Treatment of onychomycosis is guided by the severity, symptoms, number of nails
affected, possible drug interactions, drug intolerance and patient expectation. Choosing
the right antifungal preparation is aided by the identification of the underlying causative fungus. Dermatophyte fungi including Trichophyton spp. can be treated with oral
terbinafine (6-12 weeks) or itraconazole (continuous or pulsed for 3–4 months). Topical
preparations (applied twice weekly for 6-12 months) are usually reserved for more limited
nail disease or for those unable to take oral antifungal drugs.
Candida yeast around the nails is usually present in a mixed infection along with
dermatophyte fungi and/or bacteria. Fluconazole orally can be helpful, as can topical
clotrimazole, for any associated Candida skin involvement.

KEY POINTS

• Fungal nail infections are most common amongst adults and immunosuppressed patients.
• Onychomycosis causes morbidity and cosmetic embarrassment rather than severe
disease.

• Oral antifungal drugs are more effective than topical treatment alone in treating
onychomycosis.

CASE 88:

PATCHY ASYMPTOMATIC HAIR LOSS OVER THE SCALP

History
A 15-year-old girl presents with a 3-month history of hair loss. The girl’s mother had
noticed an initial small patch of hair loss over the posterior scalp. Her family had thought
this might be due to ‘stress’ as the girl’s grandfather had recently died. Subsequently, the
initial patch increased in size and over the past six weeks multiple patches of hair loss
have been noticed. She has a past history of eczema and hay fever. She is otherwise well
and has a family history of hypothyroidism.
Examination
There are multiple patches of alopecia over the occipital and parietal scalp, the skin looks
normal (Fig. 88.1). At the periphery of the patches of alopecia are ‘exclamation mark’
hairs. No erythema or scale is seen on the scalp. The rest of her body hair is normal, as
are her nails. There is no occipital lymphadenopathy.

Questions
• What is the diagnosis?
• Would you request any investigations?
• How would you manage this patient?

Figure 88.1

195

ANSWER 88
When assessing patients with hair loss it is important to first establish whether the alopecia is focal or diffuse, whether the skin on the scalp is normal or diseased and, if the
skin is diseased, is there scarring? This girl had patchy alopecia with normal skin, which
is highly suggestive of the diagnosis of alopecia areata. This is an autoimmune disease;
inflammatory cells target the growing hairs, which subsequently fall out.
Hair growth is cyclical, with three phases: anagen (growing phase); catagen (resting
phase); and telogen (shedding phase). Alopecia areata is a common autoimmune disease
that occurs in approximately 1 per cent of the population and generally begins in young
adults.
Classically, it presents with well-demarcated circular patches of gradual, asymptomatic
hair loss with no evidence of inflammation or scarring over the scalp. Pathognomonic
exclamation mark hairs are seen which appear as broken off stubby hairs due to the
proximal shaft being narrower than the distal shaft. Eyebrows, eyelashes and the beard
area are also affected. Other patterns include totalis where complete hair loss occurs over
the entire scalp and universalis where hair is lost from all body sites. In addition, evidence
of nail pitting can be seen. The differential diagnosis includes other causes of a nonscarring alopecia including tinea capitis, traction alopecia and trichotillomania (constant
rubbing or pulling of the hair).
The course of alopecia areata is unpredictable. Spontaneous remission is common in more
patchy disease. When regrowth occurs the hair is much finer and often white or grey
initially. After the first episode, 30 per cent of patients regrow the hair within one year.
Recurrences are common, however. Poor prognosis is associated with prepubertal onset,
occipital involvement, prolonged duration of hair loss in a given area and atopy.
Treatment is dependent on the extent. The prognosis for a solitary, small lesion is excellent, so no treatment may be required as spontaneous regrowth often occurs. For further
focal disease, topical or intra-lesional corticosteroids can be helpful. For more extensive
disease short courses of systemic corticosteroids, ciclosporin, phototherapy (psoralen–
UVA) and topical immunotherapy to induce a contact sensitization with diphencyprone
can be useful.
Alopecia areata is associated with other autoimmune diseases including vitiligo, Addison’s
disease and thyroid disease, which is why the family history of autoimmune disease in
this case is relevant. However, studies have shown a concordance rate of 55 per cent in
monozygotic twins, suggesting that both genetic and environmental factors are relevant.
Atopy also appears to be linked. Therefore, blood tests to rule out other underlying
autoimmune diseases should be considered in patients presenting with alopecia areata.

KEY POINTS

• Hair growth is cyclical, in three phases: anagen, catagen and telogen.
• Alopecia areata can be focal or diffuse.
• ‘Exclamation mark’ hairs are pathognomonic of alopecia areata.

CASE 89:

FRONTAL HAIR LOSS IN A WOMAN

History
A 55-year-old woman presents with an 18-month history of hair thinning over her
frontal scalp. She denies any symptoms from her scalp and has not lost hair elsewhere.
She takes hormone replacement therapy and is otherwise well. Her brother and father
had both suffered with male pattern baldness in their 40s. Her mother has always had a
‘good head of hair’.
Examination
There is diffuse thinning of her hair over the frontal scalp extending to the vertex
(Fig. 89.1). The hair that is present is finer in texture and shorter than the hair over the
rest of her scalp. The scalp skin appears normal as are her nails.

Figure 89.1

Questions
• What is the diagnosis?
• What are the potential treatment options?

197

ANSWER 89
This patient is suffering from androgenetic alopecia. She has noticed gradual thinning
of her hair, particularly over the frontal scalp and vertex. The family history of hair loss
in men is relevant.
Androgenetic alopecia is a very common, progressive hair loss that occurs predominantly
in men (male pattern baldness). This occurs due to the combined effect of genetic predisposition and the action of androgens on hair follicles. Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) is
believed to shorten the anagen phase (growth phase) causing miniaturization of the hair
follicle which then produces finer hairs. The genetic predisposition can be inherited from
either parent. In men this can occur at any time after puberty as early as in late teens and
is present in 80 per cent by the 7th decade. In women it occurs later and the majority of
women will have a normal hormone profile. It is more pronounced after the menopause,
most commonly occurring in the 6th decade.
Androgenetic alopecia in men is usually demonstrated by a receding anterior hairline,
particularly in the parietal-temporal region resulting in the classical M-shape of hair loss.
Following this the vertex (crown) may become affected.
In women the pattern of hair loss is different. They commonly exhibit loss over the frontal scalp and the parietal and temporal regions are spared. If a young woman presents
with this pattern of hair loss then she should be examined for signs of virilization such
as clitoral hypertrophy, acne and hirsutism. If present, an underlying systemic endocrine
disease should be excluded. Testosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate levels
should be measured.
Treatment options include hairpieces such as wigs/weaves and toupées. Topical minoxidil
can be effective in some patients in reducing and partially restoring hair loss. Once discontinued though, the effect is lost. Finasteride, which inhibits 5- -reductase (an enzyme
that regulates production of DHT), can slow down hair loss in men. In women who have
elevated adrenal androgens, anti-androgen drugs such as spironolactone, cyproterone
and cimetidine can be effective. Finally, there may be a role for hair transplantation in
some patients.

KEY POINTS

• Androgenetic alopecia is a common, progressive hair loss occurring predominantly in
men.

• Genetic predisposition and the effect of androgens on follicles leads to male pattern
baldness.

• In women underlying systemic endocrine disease should be excluded.

EXCESSIVE FACIAL HAIR IN A YOUNG WOMAN

History
A 24-year-old woman with type VI skin reports an excess of facial hair and the development of hair over her chest. Her sister and mother are similarly affected, but more mildly.
She has become increasingly embarrassed by the problem and consequently has become
reclusive. She takes no medication and is systemically well.
Examination
She has increased hair growth over the lateral borders of her face, on her chin and submental regions (Fig. 90.1). Her mid-anterior chest has central dark terminal hairs which
extend to the periareolar regions.

Figure 90.1

Questions
• What is the diagnosis?
• What possible underlying causes need to be excluded?
• How would you manage this patient?

199

ANSWER 90
This patient feels she has an excess of facial and body hair, which is referred to as hirsutism. This is a perceived excessive growth of terminal hair in women in a male pattern.
It is a very common problem that occurs predominantly over the upper lip, chin, periareolar regions, abdomen, posterior trunk, shoulders and pubic area. The majority of patients
have idiopathic hirsutism. Risk factors include familial and ethnic influences.
Possible underlying causes include ovarian diseases such as polycystic ovarian syndrome
and virilizing tumours; adrenal causes, congenital adrenal hyperplasia and Cushing’s
disease; and iatrogenic cause, androgens and progesterone. In patients presenting with
hirsutism it is important to elicit a family and drug history and to look clinically for
signs of virilization, which include androgenic alopecia, acne, clitoral hypertrophy and
deepening of the voice.
Most patients with hirsutism have a normal menstrual cycle and no signs of virilization.
It is therefore unlikely that these patients have a significant endocrine cause. In such
patients it is likely that there is increased end-order sensitivity to androgens. Androgens
promote conversion of vellus hairs to terminal ones in androgen-sensitive hair follicles
(sites such as the chin area.)
Treatment is generally unsatisfactory. Temporary hair removal techniques include waxing, plucking, shaving and threading. More permanent techniques include electrolysis
and hair-removal lasers. Anti-androgen therapies include cyproterone acetate, sprinolactone, cimetidine and the oral contraceptive pill.

KEY POINTS

• Hirsuitism is excessive growth of terminal hair in women in a male pattern.
• It occurs mainly over the upper lip, chin, periareolar regions and pubic area.
• Underlying causes include ovarian diseases and virilizing tumours.

MULTIPLE SKIN LESIONS DEVELOP IN A RENAL
TRANSPLANT RECIPIENT

History
A 35-year-old woman presents to the dermatology clinic with several skin lesions over
sun-exposed sites. A few lesions on the dorsi of her hands had become slightly tender but
are otherwise asymptomatic. More recently she has developed a rapidly growing lesion
on her lower lip that bleeds when traumatized. She had undergone cryotherapy and
curettage and cautery to several scaly lesions in the past. Twenty years ago she had
undergone a renal transplant for renal failure secondary to nephrotic syndrome. She is
taking mycophenolate mofetil and azathioprine. When she was a young child she lived
in East Africa with her parents who had helped set up a school. She herself had worked
with an aid agency based in the United Kingdom. She has no history of atopy and is
otherwise well.
Examination
She has a hyperkeratotic cutaneous horn on her lower lip (Fig. 91.1) with multiple erythematous scaly patches over the dorsum of the hands, forearms and face. In addition
there are several previous surgical scar sites.

Figure 91.1

Questions
• What is the most likely diagnosis?
• What dermatological advice should be given to transplant recipients?

201

ANSWER 91
Immunosuppressed patients are more vulnerable to the damaging effects of high-intensity
ultraviolet (UV) light than immunocompetent ones. The most likely diagnosis in this case
is a squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) on the lip, multiple actinic keratoses and superficial
basal cell carcinomas (BCCs) elsewhere. Multiple skin cancers have arisen in this patient
due to a combination of factors including immunosuppressant medication, fair skin and
significant sun exposure in childhood.
Skin malignancy is the most frequently reported cancer in organ transplant recipients:
the prevalence is 16.5 per cent in the UK. The majority of these are non-melanoma skin
cancers (NMSCs) such as SCCs and BCCs. A NMSC presents at an earlier age and spreads
more rapidly in transplant recipients than in the general population. Patients frequently
have multiple lesions over time and consequently suffer substantial morbidity and a
seven-fold increase in mortality from skin cancer. There is also an increased risk of developing malignant melanoma and Kaposi’s sarcoma. In addition premalignant lesions are
very commonly seen including actinic keratoses and Bowen’s disease.
UV radiation is a significant risk factor for the development of skin malignancy. Organ
transplant recipients require life-long immunosuppressant medication to prevent host
organ rejection. The immunosuppressants impair the capacity of immune surveillance to
repair and destroy UV damage and therefore leave patients vulnerable to skin cancers. In
addition, transplant recipients are susceptible to infection with human papilloma virus,
which may be associated with the development of some SCCs.
Photoprotection post-transplantation is essential in these patients. The high incidence,
rapid growth, and increased metastatic potential of skin malignancy in these patients
justifies the surveillance service provided in many dermatology units. In order to reduce
the tumour burden in these patients, their management requires an interdisciplinary
approach. Early detection and appropriate treatment of lesions are essential.
Complete excision is the ‘gold standard’ for SCCs in transplant recipients, if possible.
Treatments of premalignant lesions may include topical therapy with 5-fluorouracil,
5% imiquimod cream, cryotherapy, and curettage and cautery. Finally, those transplant
recipients who have had multiple SCCs should be commenced on a life-long oral retinoid
such as acitretin to help reduce the number of new skin cancers developing.

KEY POINTS

• Skin cancer is the most frequently reported cancer in organ transplant recipients.
• The majority of these are non-melanoma skin cancers such as SCCs and BCCs.
• Photoprotection post-transplantation is essential in these patients.

History
A 37-year-old man presents with a rash and diarrhoea to the haematology out-patient
team. Six months previously he had developed red patches on his skin, which then
became pale and gradually felt firm and tight. He describes stiffness of his elbow and
knee joints, such that he is having trouble straightening his limbs. One year previously
he had undergone a matched, unrelated, allogenic bone marrow transplant for acute myeloid leukaemia. He is taking multiple medications including aciclovir, co-trimoxazole,
penicillin V, itraconazole and omeprazole.
Examination
He has extensive skin changes over his trunk and limbs with erythematous patches with
hypopigmented centres (Fig. 92.1). There is mottled hyperpigmentation and generalized
thickening of the skin, which appears waxy and feels tight. Also, fixed flexion deformities
are present over his elbows and knees.

Questions
• What is the diagnosis?
• What other systems can be involved?
• How would you manage this patient?

203

ANSWER 92
This patient was diagnosed with chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Skin changes
characterized by thickening and tightening after bone marrow transplantation are
referred to as sclerodermoid GVHD.
GVHD is an immune disorder that commonly follows bone marrow transplantation. It
is less common after solid organ transplantation and, rarely, has also been reported in
patients after blood transfusion and by maternal–fetal transfusion. GVHD results from a
reaction of incompatible, immunocompetent donor cells against the tissue of an immunocompetent host. Acute and chronic disease are described both of which increase the
patient’s susceptibility to infection.
Chronic GVHD is said to occur more than 100 days after transplantation. Patients may
have had acute GVHD (usually between 14 and 21 days post-transplantation) or it arises
de novo. Cutaneous disease has different morphological types. These include lichenoid,
sclerodermoid and eczematous types. Lichenoid disease is characterized by flat-topped
violaceous ‘lichen–planus’-like papules and plaques, which manifest initially on the
extremities but can become generalized. Mucosal disease is also seen. Sclerodermoid disease occurs predominantly over the trunk and upper lower limbs and the skin is described
as ‘hardening’ or ‘tight’. This disease can also become generalized leading to joint contractures. Hair loss is also a common feature, which is usually permanent.
GVHD may also affect the eyes, mouth, joints, gastrointestional tract (diarrhoea), liver
(transaminitis) and respiratory system.
Prevention of GVHD is the mainstay of treatment. Chronic GVHD carries a high morbidity and mortality. It is commonly associated with recurrent and occasionally fatal bacterial infections, which are the main cause of death in patients with GVHD. Patients are
immunosuppressed with a variety of medication including ciclosporin, mycophenolate
and tacrolimus with or without prednisone.
Managing skin GVHD is dependent on the extent and affected site. For limited disease
topical therapy with potent corticosteroids can be of benefit. For more extensive disease the aim is to treat GVHD before life-threatening sepsis occurs. High-dose systemic
corticosteroids are usually added to the immunosuppressant regime. Phototherapy with
psoralen–UVA and high-dose long-wave ultraviolet (UV) radiation (UVA1) may reduce
the severity of the cutaneous skin problems. In addition, to reduce the amount of immunosuppression required, extracorporeal photophoresis can be effective.
KEY POINTS

• Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is an immune disorder that may occur after bone
marrow transplantation.

• Acute and chronic forms of GVDH have been described.
• Different types of cutaneous GVHD include lichenoid, sclerodermoid and eczematous.

CASE 93:

STREAKY SKIN CHANGES IN A TODDLER AND A
MATERNAL HISTORY OF MISCARRIAGE

History
A 22-month-old girl is referred with a persistent colour change in a patchy distribution
over her body. She is otherwise well and fully vaccinated to date. She was born post-term
at 41 weeks’ gestation by normal vaginal delivery. Her mother reports that she had a
blistering skin rash at birth and a ‘high white cell count’. She was treated with antibiotics
for one week on the neonatal unit and had extensive tests to rule out viral illness, all of
which were negative. Her mother shares neonatal photos and is certain that the areas of
colour change do not correspond with the areas of previous blistering.
Her family history is remarkable in that her maternal grandmother recalls her mother suffering from a similar transient neonatal blistering eruption. She has an older sister aged
7 years and her mother has been investigated for recurrent miscarriages.

Examination
The girl is clearly thriving with height and weight between the 75th and 91st centiles
for her age. She has achieved age-appropriate developmental milestones. She has striking linear streaked and whorled areas of brown hyperpigmentation, predominantly over
her trunk but also involving her legs. Figure 93.1 shows a well-defined, irregular linear
streak of hyperpigmentation extending along the dorsal aspect of her left leg. The distribution of the colour changes corresponds with Blaschko’s lines. She has marked ridging
of three fingernails and one toenail. All twenty of her deciduous teeth have erupted; she
has two peg-shaped teeth. Her mother is also happy to be examined and she has subtle
skin changes composed of fine pale, hairless, atrophic, ‘porcelain’-like streaks over her
posterior calves. She has two hypoplastic nails and one conical tooth.

Questions
• What is the diagnosis?
• What is the implication of this diagnosis?
• What is the explanation for the distribution of the hyperpigmentation?

Figure 93.1

205

ANSWER 93
This is the classical clinical scenario of an uncommon genodermatosis called incontinentia pigmenti (IP). Skin features are subdivided into four stages: vesicular, verrucous,
hyperpigmented, and atrophic. There are various hair, nail, dental, ophthalmological and
neurological anomalies described in association with IP. The differential diagnosis of the
neonatal vesicular stage, which is typically associated with a peripheral eosinophilia,
includes infections (bullous impetigo, herpes simplex, varicella), Langerhans cell histiocytosis, epidermolysis bullosa, bullous mastocytosis and autoimmune blistering diseases.
IP is an X-linked dominant disorder, lethal in the majority of males in utero, explaining
the mother’s recurrent miscarriages. The pathogenic mutation occurs within the NEMO/
IKK gene. Genetic testing is available, although prenatal testing is not generally offered
as prognosis for affected females is generally excellent and affected male fetuses do not
generally survive into the second trimester.
Clinical presentations vary, even among family members (Table 93.1). The differences in
clinical phenotype expression are attributed to lyonization resulting in functional mosaicism, which in the skin manifests along the curvilinear lines of Blaschko. These represent
random X-inactivation and migration of clonal epidermal cells along embryological
developmental lines. Cells expressing the mutated X chromosome selectively eliminate,
and affected females have an extremely skewed X-inactivation pattern.

• Clinical features vary according to the random inactivation of the affected X
chromosome and vary with age.

CASE 94:

A YOUNG ADULT WITH SEIZURES AND MARKEDLY
PHOTO-DAMAGED SKIN

History
A 17-year-old woman is brought to the accident and emergency department by ambulance. She had collapsed in the high street; witnesses called an ambulance immediately
as she began to fit. She had two further fits on the way to hospital and the paramedical
team described classic generalized tonic–clonic seizures, including a stereotypical ictal
cry. She is drowsy and confused on arrival. Her Medi-Alert bracelet confirms that she is
known to have epilepsy and that she has another diagnosis, ‘XP’. Her family are on their
way to the hospital. In the meantime the medical team ensures that she is now stable.
Examination
She appears to be in a deep sleep and is difficult to rouse, although she withdraws from
pain. Her blood pressure is 105/60 mmHg, heart rate 68 beats/min and respiratory rate
12 breaths/min. She is clearly still in a post-ictal state. There are marked skin changes
affecting all exposed areas of skin, particularly her face (especially cheeks, nose and
pinna of her ears), neck, ‘V’ of the chest and the dorsa of her hands, but not affecting
her trunk or other clothed areas. There is poikiloderma (skin atrophy, and telangiectasias
with mottled hyperpigmentation and hypopigmentation) (Fig. 94.1). She has bilateral
ectropions and a narrow ‘pinched’ nose.

Figure 94.1

Questions
• The distribution of the skin changes suggests a role for what environmental factor?
• What is XP?
• What skin complications can occur in XP?

207

ANSWER 94
The distribution of this patient’s skin changes is typical for a photodermatosis, occurring
on sites most exposed to direct sunlight. Areas more protected from sunlight – such as
the scalp, upper eyelids, infranasal and submental areas, as well as fully clothed areas –
are typically spared. The changes described are chronic and this is likely to represent a
longstanding condition. The most common causes for photosensitive eruptions include
drug reactions; however, although neuroleptic medications such as phenothiazines may
be implicated, anti-epileptic medications are not particularly associated with phototoxic
eruptions except in the context of porphyria. The only porphyria with prominent chronic
cutaneous findings is porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT) (acute photosensitivity is seen in
other cutaneous porphyrias). PCT is characterized by skin fragility with tense haemorrhagic vesicles and bullae over sun-exposed sites, with hypertrichosis, atrophy and milia
developing.
XP stands for xeroderma pigmentosum, a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by a cellular hypersensitivity to ultraviolet (UV) radiation resulting from a defect in
DNA repair. Individuals with XP develop multiple cutaneous neoplasms at a young age
(from 4 to 5 years of age). All forms of skin cancer are described in XP, including basal
cell carcinomas, squamous cell carcinomas and malignant melanoma. They are more
prevalent over sun-exposed skin, but can also affect the eyes and even buccal mucosa.
Neurological problems, including epilepsy, ataxia, spasticity or developmental delay, are
present in approximately 20 per cent of patients with XP.
The goals of treatment of patients with XP are to minimize morbidity and prevent mortality primarily through sun protection, through use of sunscreens and sun avoidance
measures. Regular skin surveillance, as well as ophthamological and neurological review,
are part of routine care of patients with XP.

KEY POINTS

• Xeroderma pigmentosa (XP) is a rare autosomal recessive skin disorder characterized by
dramatic and early-onset photodamage of sun-exposed areas of the skin.

• XP is caused by an inherited defect in repair of UV-induced DNA damage.
• Skin cancers arise from a young age, are typically multiple and result in significant
morbidity and potentially early death.

CASE 95:

A YOUNG MAN SEEKING GENETIC COUNSELLING
ADVICE REGARDING HIS DRY SKIN CONDITION

History
A 28-year-old man attends your clinic with his girlfriend. He has had dry skin since birth,
although it has been worse since he became a teenager. His skin is generally itchy and
requires regular application of emollients and vigorous twice-weekly exfoliation while
washing. He is otherwise fit and healthy and a well-adjusted individual. He is planning
to get married and would like information about the risk of his children being affected
with the same skin condition. He knows other family members who are similarly affected.
There is no history of consanguinity. He reports that all affected children were born by
emergency caesarean section after very long labour (Fig. 95.1).

Figure 95.1 The patient’s family tree.

Examination
On examination he has normal teeth, hair and nails. He has generally dry skin with
prominent adherent grey-brown scales over the extensor surfaces of his neck and limbs
(Fig. 95.2). He has adherent bran-like scale throughout his scalp. There is no erythroderma or blistering. His hands and feet are almost unaffected, with little scale and no
hyperlinearity or keratoderma.
Questions
• What is the diagnosis and pattern of
inheritance?
• How would you advise this couple
about risk to a future generation?

Figure 95.2
209

ANSWER 95
This case is a presentation of X-linked ichthysosis. In this condition dryness and scaliness of the skin is often present from birth, and gradually becomes more prominent in
late childhood. The build-up of adherent scale imparts a ‘dirty appearance’ to the skin.
Typically, the ichthyosis involves particularly the posterior neck, upper trunk, and extensor surfaces of the extremities, with sparing of the flexures as well as palms and soles
(palmoplantar hyperlinearity is a feature of ichthyosis vulgaris). It is one of the most frequent enzyme disorders in humans with an incidence of approximately 1 in 6000 males.
It is due to a deficiency of steroid sulphatase (STS), which leads to epidermal barrier
defect and corneocyte (or essentially scale) retention.
Most affected individuals regard it as an annoyance, although it can be emotionally
challenging in childhood and adolescence. Cryptorchidism can be associated in up to
20 per cent of cases. STS deficiency slows the delivery of an infant because of insufficient cervical dilatation. A relative failure occurs in the response to intravenous oxytocin. Since both are indications for caesarean delivery or forceps delivery, an increased
perinatal morbidity and mortality may occur.
Other differential diagnoses to consider include ichthyosis vulgaris (associated with palmar hyperlinearity, atopy and an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern) and lamellar
ichthyosis (autosomal recessive inheritance). The diagnosis of X-linked ichthyosis can be
confirmed by biochemical assay of STS and by genetic testing.
You can reassure the patient that his sons will not be affected, however his daughters
will be obligate carriers. His extended family would benefit from genetic counselling and
advice. In particular his female relatives should inform obstetric teams about the possible
complications related to prolonged labour or delayed delivery.
KEY POINTS

• X-linked ichthyosis is caused by steroid sulphatase deficiency.
• The condition is managed with emollients, keratolytics and mechanical exfoliation, with
most patients considering it to be an annoyance without significant morbidity.

• It is associated with prolonged labour and, less commonly, cryptorchidism.

CASE 96:

RECURRENT BLISTERS ON THE EXTREMITIES
ASSOCIATED WITH MINOR PRESSURE/FRICTION

History
A 14-year-old boy attends the dermatology out-patient clinic with his mother. He is
increasingly troubled by blisters. The blisters affect the plantar surfaces of his feet, particularly the heel, below the metatarsal heads and toes. They have also occurred on his
fingers following an exam last year, and a recent school ski-trip provoked blisters over
his shins. The appearance of blisters on his feet is directly related to activity and they
occur with relatively less activity in summer.
He is otherwise well and not on medication. His mother and one of his two older sisters
also suffer with blisters. They have only experienced plantar blisters, and comment that
new shoes or walking further than 1.6 km can provoke blisters. They limit their activity
and the types of footwear accordingly. None of the family was affected with blisters at
birth.

Examination
There is nothing abnormal to find on full examination except for several tense noninflammatory blisters in an asymmetrical distribution over the weight-bearing aspects of
the plantar surface of both feet (Fig. 96.1). He has no skin lesions elsewhere.

Questions
• What is the diagnosis?
• What investigations can you perform to
confirm the diagnosis?
• How would you manage this patient?

Figure 96.1

211

ANSWER 96
The patient gives a story which is suggestive of a mechano-bullous skin disorder (blisters
due to skin fragility occurring at sites of friction). The positive family history supports
an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. Apparent onset around adolescence is not
unusual and often relates to growth, weight gain and increased physical activity. This
patient’s history is typical of epidermolysis bullosa (EB) simplex with a localized distribution (also referred to as Webber–Cockayne syndrome).
EB simplex is a group of disorders characterized by intra-epidermal blistering. The disease
phenotype can range from mild to severe. The mildest and most common form is EB
simplex localized. Although it can present in infancy or childhood, presentation in adulthood or even non-presentation (such as the patient’s mother and sister) is not uncommon.
Blistering is worse in warm weather as sweat increases friction in footwear.
Biopsy of affected skin is not performed, as the plantar surface of the feet heals poorly.
Gently rubbing an unaffected area of non-plantar skin for a biopsy can produce a
subclinical blister which will demonstrate the ultrastructural basis of skin fragility.
Demonstration of a pathogenic mutation within Keratin5 or Keratin14 will confirm the
diagnosis.
The management of EB simplex is:
1. avoidance of new blisters by reducing sweat and minimizing friction within footwear,
as well as practical and supportive advice around school, work and leisure activities;
2. ‘popping’ blisters using aseptic methods to relieve pressure and pain and prevention
of infection within blisters and erosions, with special dressings which can be removed
without trauma to the skin;
3. treatment of callosities which form around areas of frequent blistering, but can act as
foci for the development of new blisters;
4. offering adequate and targeted pain control for episodes of blisters as well as chronic
neuropathic pain; and
5. genetic counselling.
KEY POINTS

• There are different forms of epidermolysis bullosa with site and severity of blistering
varying according to the molecular defect.

• EB simplex localized is due to dominant negative mutation of either Keratin 5 or 14
(autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance).

• Practical advice around reducing blistering, blister management and pain control are
the cornerstones of management.

CASE 97:

AN INCREASING NUMBER OF ASYMPTOMATIC FACIAL
LESIONS IN A YOUNG BOY

History
A 9-year-old boy attends the paediatric dermatology clinic. Both he and his parents are
concerned about an accumulation of facial lesions over several months. His mother has
tried several over-the-counter anti-acne remedies without apparent benefit. He is otherwise well, although in comparison with his siblings (two older sisters) he has struggled at
school; closer questioning suggests that he has problems academically as well as with his
behaviour, although this has never been formally evaluated. He does not take medication.
His family are all well, his parents are non-consanguineous.
Examination
He has symmetrically distributed red to pink papules, each measuring 1–3 mm in diameter localized to the nasolabial folds and extending to cheeks, nostrils and also the chin
(Fig. 97.1). The individual lesions are smooth and firm. Examination of his skin under
Wood’s light demonstrates six hypomelanotic macules over his lower back, abdomen
and buttocks. Examination of his cardiorespiratory system reveals a midsystolic ejection
murmur. His neurological system is normal including fundoscopy, vision and hearing. He
does appear to be easily frustrated and requires significant reassurance from his mother
throughout the examination, avoiding eye contact and following only the instructions of
his mother. His abdomen is soft and there are no palpable masses.
Both of his parents also agreed to full skin examination and no abnormalities were
detected.

Questions
• What are these lesions?
• With what are they associated?
• How would you investigate further?

Figure 97.1

213

ANSWER 97
These lesions are facial angiofibromas (formerly also called adenoma sebaceum). These
lesions, associated with hypomelanotic ‘ash-leaf’ macules, are features of tuberous sclerosis complex. Other cutaneous features include shagreen patch, fibrous plaques, periungual
fibromas and confetti-like hypopigmentation. Autosomal dominantly inherited mutations
of two genes, TSC1 (chromosomal locus, 9q34; gene product hamartin) and TSC2 (16p13;
tuberin), can cause tuberous sclerosis complex, which has a broad clinical spectrum.
There is a high rate of de-novo mutations with 50–70 per cent of cases presenting as
such. Promising new systemic treatments known as mTOR inhibitors are being trialled for
complications of tuberous sclerosis. Examination of family members, however, can detect
features of a less severe phenotype.
Diagnosis is based on a constellation of clinical features. Definite tuberous sclerosis complex is diagnosed by the presence of either two major features, or one major feature plus
two minor features. Presentation with fewer features may fall into categories of probable
or possible tuberous sclerosis. A thorough skin examination is important, as skin signs are
identified in the majority of affected individuals. Ash-leaf hypomelanotic macules may
be present from birth or infancy. Shagreen patches or facial plaques often appear during
the first decade. Facial angiofibromas commonly develop in late childhood or around
puberty, often stabilizing at puberty. Periungual fibromas often begin at puberty and may
continue to accumulate with age.
The clinical scenario presents four issues that need to be addressed: (1) question mark
over neurodevelopment; (2) possible pathological cardiac murmur; (3) potential for other
occult hamartomas; and (4) implications for other family members.
1. Further investigation of neurodevelopment would include a multiprofessional assessment, ideally within a Child Development Centre, by a community paediatrician, an
educational psychologist and a speech therapist. Over 50 per cent of individuals with
tuberous sclerosis complex have a low intelligence quotient (IQ) or developmental
disorder (particularly autism or language disorders). Unrecognized petit mal seizures
can cause problems with school performance, justifying an assessment by a paediatric
neurologist with or without electroencephalographic monitoring. A CT scan of the
brain would look for evidence of subependymal nodules which may be calcified; MRI
is more sensitive in the detection of subependymal giant cell astrocytomas.
2. Further assessment of the cardiac murmur would entail an ECG and echocardiogram
to detect cardiac rhabdomyomas. These lesions usually regress with age and are not
treated unless of functional significance.
3. Other baseline investigations would include routine blood tests (particularly renal
function), renal ultrasound scan, and ophthalmology review (looking for translucent
retinal nodules which may represent hamartomas or astrocytomas). Dental pits may
also be found.
4. Family members should be offered renal biochemistry and ultrasonography as well
as fundoscopy. Even in cases of apparent de-novo mutation unaffected parents of
children with tuberous sclerosis complex have a recurrence risk of 1–2 per cent in
subsequent pregnancies. Genetic counselling should be initiated.

MACROGLOSSIA, FATIGUE AND BACK PAIN IN AN
ELDERLY WOMAN

History
A 68-year-old woman presents with a 3-week history
of worsening back pain. She has been feeling tired
for three months and is also complaining of gradually progressive tongue ‘thickening’. She is otherwise
well and has not attended her GP for more than five
years. She is on no medication.
Examination
She is pale and has marked tenderness on palpation
of specific areas over her lumbar spine. She has an
enlarged tongue, with a smooth papulo-nodular pink
infiltrate disrupting the papillae (Fig. 98.1). There Figure 98.1
is similar involvement of the mucosal aspect of the
upper lip extending onto the vermillion lip. Examination of her cardiorespiratory and

Questions
• What is the likely unifying diagnosis?
• What is occurring in the patient’s mouth?

217

ANSWER 98
The likely unifying diagnosis in an elderly patient presenting with back pain, anaemia,
elevated ESR and an infiltrative process involving the tongue and proteinuria is multiple
myeloma, a disease characterized by malignant proliferation of plasma cells and consequent abundance of a monoclonal paraprotein. The presentation of myeloma can be
highly variable. The diagnosis can be confirmed by demonstration of a plasma cell clone
within the bone marrow and a paraprotein within blood and/or urine. Hypercalcaemia is
a common complication.
The infiltration of her tongue and mucosal lip is due to the deposition of light-chain
amyloid (AL). Amyloid is defined as in-vivo deposited material distinguished by fibrillar
electron micrographic appearance. All types of amyloid consist of a major fibrillar protein
that defines the type of amyloid, which can be classified as systemic, hereditary, localized, or organ specific. Cutaneous involvement can occur as an isolated phenomenon or
as a manifestation of systemic disease. Mucocutaneous lesions are common in systemic
AL and include waxy nodules and plaques, ecchymoses, pinch purpuras, sclerodermoid
skin changes and haemorrhagic bullae.
Careful examination and investigation for other systemic amyloid involvement is
required. Typical extracutaneous sites include heart, kidney, peripheral nerve, gastrointestinal tract, and respiratory tract. Although patients with both myeloma and systemic
amyloidosis associated with other diseases can benefit in terms of symptom control from
treatment, there is currently no cure for either condition.
KEY POINTS

• Multiple myeloma can have a highly variable presentation and potential complications
include deposition of light-chain systemic amyloid.

• AL amyloidosis can have a variable presentation, but should prompt investigation
particularly for an underlying plasma cell dyscrasia.

• There is no curative treatment for AL amyloidosis.

SUBACUTE PRURITIC ERYTHEMATOUS ERUPTION IN
AN ELDERLY PATIENT WITH WEIGHT LOSS

History
A 59-year-old woman presents with a gradually worsening eruption over 7 weeks. The
eruption is pruritic and has not responded to the application of emollients and moderately
potent topical glucocorticoids. She has no previous history of skin lesions and reports that
she is otherwise well, although she has a poor appetite and has lost 8 kg body weight over
the past three months. She does not take medication. She works as a shop assistant and
consumes 10 units of alcohol per week. She stopped smoking four years ago.
Examination
The patient’s pulse is 76/min and blood pressure 128/76 mmHg. Her striking skin eruption
involves the trunk, limbs and neck. There are widespread macular erythematous bands
with a wood-grain–like and whorled concentric configuration and fine scaling along the
borders (Fig. 99.1). There are no abnormalities on examination of her cardiovascular and
respiratory systems. Her abdomen is soft and non-tender with no masses palpable. She
has no breast masses. She has a firm 1.5  2.0-cm left supraclavicular lymph node.

Questions

• What further investigations would you perform?
• What is the management of this patient?

220

This page intentionally left blank

ANSWER 99
The very striking appearance of this eruption is pathognomonic of erythema gyratum
repens (EGR) and potentially a paraneoplastic process. Approximately 80 per cent of
patients with EGR have an underlying malignancy. It can also be associated with connective tissue disease (CREST, systemic lupus erythematosus) or infection (such as
tuberculosis). The characteristic concentric erythematous bands forming a wood-grain
appearance help distinguish EGR from other figurate erythemas, such as erythema annulare centrifugum (may also be paraneoplastic or associated with drugs or other systemic
illnesses), erythema migrans (associated with Lyme disease), and erythema marginatum
rheumaticum (occurring in association with rheumatic fever). EGR does not respond to
skin targeted therapy but rather to treatments aimed at underlying disease.
This clinical picture is highly suggestive of an underlying malignancy. The palpable left
supraclavicular lymph node (Virchow’s node) with FNA findings of adenocarcinoma
points towards gastric pathology.
The next investigations for this patient are an oesophago-gastro-doudenoscopy (OGD)
and CT scans of the chest and abdomen. These investigations demonstrated a polypoid
gastric adenocarcinoma with lymph node involvement. Resection of the malignancy and
lymph node dissection resulted in rapid resolution of the skin eruption.

!

The differential diagnosis of figurate erythemas
• Dermatophyte infections – usually associated with superficial scale, which contains
spores or hyphae, visible on direct microscopy and will culture on appropriate
medium
• Annular urticaria – often occurs with more characteristic lesions of urticaria
elsewhere, symptoms of pruritus, transient lesions
• Annular psoriasis – unstable psoriasis (e.g. pustular psoriasis) may have an annular
configuration
• Subacute lupus erythematosus – often over photo-exposed sites but may be
generalized, check Ro/La as well as other lupus-associated autoantibodies
• Bullous pemphigoid – early (prebullous) lesions are intensely pruritic and urticated,
may be annular
• Erythema multiforme – typically targetoid lesions, usually acral ± mucosal. Early
lesions may be annular before dusky necrosis of central lesion develops
• Necrolytic migratory erythema – rare annular eruption affecting peri-oral, genital
and acral skin, erosive or bullous annular lesions, associated with underlying
glucagonoma (closely resembles acrodermatitis enteropathica of infancy)
• Erythema gyratum repens
• Erythema annulare centrifugum
• Erythema migrans

KEY POINTS

• The striking configuration of the erythema is pathognomonic of erythema gyratum
repens (EGR).

• EGR is frequently a paraneoplastic process.
• Patients presenting with this eruption should be investigated for underlying systemic
disease and in particular malignancy.

CASE 100:

A YOUNG GIRL WITH UNUSUAL SCARS AND
UNEXPLAINED INJURIES

History
The teachers of an 11-year-old girl, who has just started a new school, ask her parents
to bring her to your attention. They are concerned that the scarring on her legs might be
non-accidental. Her mother doesn’t hesitate to attend for a medical opinion and presents
the next day.
The child is the youngest of four siblings. She was born at 36 weeks’ gestation following premature rupture of membranes. She required an inguinal hernia repair at the age
of 18 months. Of note, she has had two injuries that were difficult to explain. When
26 months old she dislocated her shoulder during ‘boisterous’ play with her father and
older sisters, and at the age of 5 years she required plastic surgical intervention to a
laceration at her left elbow following a relatively minor fall, and despite sutures the
wound dehisced and healed poorly. At the age of 3 years she was also investigated at
her mother’s request for easy bruising, but all blood tests were normal. She has required
podiatric attention because of pain in her ankles and feet, which has been attributed to
‘flat feet’, and she uses orthotic supports in her footwear. Her mother also comments that
the child is noticeably more easily fatigued than her siblings and, tellingly, also mentions
that she is ‘double-jointed’.

Examination
There are multiple loose, atrophic scars over her knees and shins (Fig. 100.1). Her surgical
scars have a similar ‘cigarette paper’, distended appearance. Her skin in general feels very
soft, smooth and ‘doughy’. It recoils promptly after stretching. She has a Beighton score of
9 (maximum score). The remainder of her physical examination, including eyes, teeth and
cardiovascular system, is normal. Her mother’s physical examination is unremarkable.
Questions
• What differential diagnoses should be
considered?
• What is the relevance of the Beighton
score?
• What is the management of this patient?

ANSWER 100
The important features are skin fragility (explaining the easy bruising, multiplicity of
scars and need for plastic surgery intervention), abnormal scarring (wound dehiscence
and atrophic scars) and hypermobile joints (explaining fatiguability, joint dislocations
and high Beighton score). Non-accidental injury is frequently considered before the correct diagnosis is reached. Epidermolysis bullosa, although characterized by skin fragility and abnormal scarring, is also associated with blistering and not with hypermobile
joints. The main differential diagnoses are inherited connective tissue disorders such as
Ehlers–Danlos syndrome, cutis laxa, Marfan’s syndrome, and pseudoxanthoma elasticum.

The Beighton criteria are used in the assessment of hypermobile joints. The Beighton criteria combine phenotype, clinical history and symptoms as well as the above score. A high
Beighton score is highly suggestive of joint hypermobility.
At least six different phenotypes of Ehlers–Danlos syndrome are classified; however,
there is a great deal of overlap between them and absolute clinical distinction is difficult.
The complications of Ehlers–Danlos syndrome are varied and include vascular complications (fortunately rare). The vascular form may be complicated by catastrophic arterial
rupture and phenotypically shares some marfanoid (facies and habitus) and osteogenesis
imperfecta (osteoporosis) features. The history (including premature delivery) for this
child is most suggestive of classical (type I or II) Ehlers–Danlos disease.
The presence of cardiovascular disease (e.g. mitral valve disease and/or aneurysms)
and dental disease should be formally assessed. Most forms of Ehlers–Danlos syndrome
are associated with a normal life-expectancy, although lifestyle may be restricted.
Hypermobility can be the major cause of disability and requires support, physical and
occupational therapy as well as appropriate pain management. Other family members
should be assessed for features of this autosomal dominant syndrome complex.
KEY POINTS

• Ehlers–Danlos syndrome is characterized by varying degrees of skin laxity and fragility,
with easy bruising and abnormal atrophic scars, as well as joint hypermobility.

• It is frequently unrecognized and the diagnosis may only come to light after
non-accidental injury has been considered.

• The cutaneous features may be disfiguring, however the joint disease can be disabling.

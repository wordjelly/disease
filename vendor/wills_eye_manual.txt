Wills Eye celebrated its 175th anniversary in 2009 and the Retina
Service its 50th anniversary in 2010. Hard to believe. Now, in 2012,
we are celebrating the sixth edition of The Wills Eye Manual. Conceived by Mark Friedberg and Christopher Rapuano when they were
residents in 1990, the manual has had a great track record. To date,
150,000 copies have been sold, and it has been translated into ten
languages. It is also now helping to disseminate educational information to physicians in developing countries, especially through the
American Academy of Ophthalmology’s Ophthalmic News & Education (ONE) network.
Adam Gerstenblith and Michael Rabinowitz, the editors of the
sixth edition, have been extremely efficient in revising this latest volume. The previous edition, published in 2007, was the first to have
illustrations enhancing the descriptions of various conditions, and
the new edition includes additional and revised illustrations, where
appropriate, as well as the latest information. In the past few years
ophthalmology has taken giant steps forward, notably in the management of wet macular degeneration, use of computer chips for retinal function, the role of stem cells, and exponential progress in gene
identification of disease entities.
Although tomorrow’s future will soon be yesterday’s history, we
continue to learn more about the original Wills family. Thanks to the
National Park Service, the deed to the original Wills house and grocery (which was located behind the house) between Second and Third
on Chestnut has surfaced. The most interesting fact we learned was
that James Sr. and Hannah Wills bought the property from Benjamin
Rush, the renowned physician of the day. It was purchased for 700
pounds gold. Rush was a signer of the Declaration of Independence,
and because of his fame, President Thomas Jefferson suggested that
Meriwether Lewis pay him a visit before Lewis and William Clark left
in 1804–1806 to explore the land acquired in the Louisiana Purchase.
So, Wills with its colorful history has grown up and continues to
thrive. I am confident that it will continue to contribute new and
exciting advances, some not yet even conceived.

Preface

We are proud to present the Sixth Edition of The Wills Eye Manual.
This edition builds upon the hard work of all previous contributors, and would not be possible without the collaborative effort of
the Wills Eye Institute residents and faculty. Our goal is to continue
to provide the most accurate and current information regarding the
office and emergency room diagnosis, management, and treatment of
ophthalmic disease.
The Sixth Edition includes the results of some of the most recent
major clinical trials, including those relating to the care of patients with
macular degeneration and retinal vein occlusion. Changing trends
in the management of a variety of ophthalmic pathology, including
orbital fractures, eyelid lacerations, strabismus, amblyopia, and ocular
malignancies, are reflected in this newest edition. Many new highdefinition photographs of external, anterior segment, and posterior
segment disease processes have been added, including fundus photos of Sturge–Weber Syndrome, Wyburn-Mason Syndrome, and solar
retinopathy. We have also updated the imaging modalities highlighted
in the previous edition, with special attention to optical coherence
tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography,
and ultrasound biomicroscopy. In addition, many updated chapters
were expanded to include new, clinically relevant, topics.
With the addition of more illustrations and topics, it was necessary
to streamline various sections. To that end, and with feedback from
our readers, we have minimized redundancy throughout the manual
and removed information more commonly found in other references.
We hope you continue to find the Sixth Edition of The Wills Eye
Manual a fast, easy-to-use guide to managing ophthalmic disease.
Adam T. Gerstenblith, M.D.
Michael P. Rabinowitz, M.D.

Preface to the
First Edition
Our goal has been to produce a concise book, providing essential
diagnostic tips and specific therapeutic information pertaining to eye
disease. We realized the need for this book while managing emergency room patients at one of the largest and busiest eye hospitals in
the country. Until now, reliable information could only be obtained
in unwieldy textbooks or inaccessible journals.
As residents at Wills Eye Hospital we have benefited from the input
of some of the world-renowned ophthalmic experts in writing this
book. More importantly, we are aware of the questions that the ophthalmology resident, the attending ophthalmologist, and the emergency room physician (not trained in ophthalmology) want answered
immediately.
The book is written for the eye care provider who, in the midst of
evaluating an eye problem, needs quick access to additional information. We try to be as specific as possible, describing the therapeutic
modalities used at our institution. Many of these recommendations
are, therefore, not the only manner in which to treat a particular disorder, but indicate personal preference. They are guidelines, not rules.
Because of the forever changing wealth of ophthalmic knowledge,
omissions and errors are possible, particularly with regard to management. Drug dosages have been checked carefully, but the physician is
urged to check the Physicians’ Desk Reference or Facts and Comparisons
when prescribing unfamiliar medications. Not all contraindications
and side effects are described.
We feel this book will make a welcome companion to the many
physicians involved with treating eye problems. It is everything you
wanted to know and nothing more.
Christopher J. Rapuano, M.D.
Mark A. Friedberg, M.D.

CHEMICAL BURN

Treatment should be instituted IMMEDIATELY,
even before testing vision, unless an open globe
is suspected.
NOTE: This includes alkali (e.g., lye, cements, plasters, airbag powder, bleach, ammonia), acids (e.g.,
battery acid, pool cleaner, vinegar), solvents, detergents, and irritants (e.g., mace).

Emergency Treatment
1. Copious but gentle irrigation using saline or Ringer lactate solution for at least
30 minutes. Tap water can be used in
the absence of these solutions and may
be more efficacious in inhibiting elevated
intracameral pH than normal saline for alkali burns. NEVER use acidic solutions to
neutralize alkalis or vice versa as acid–base
reactions themselves can generate harmful
substrates. An eyelid speculum and topical anesthetic (e.g., proparacaine) can be
placed prior to irrigation. Upper and lower
fornices must be everted and irrigated. After
exclusion of open globe, particulate matter
should be flushed or manually removed.
Manual use of intravenous tubing connected to an irrigation solution facilitates the
irrigation process.
2. Wait 5 to 10 minutes after irrigation
is stopped to allow the dilutant to be
absorbed, then check the pH in the fornices using litmus paper. Irrigation is continued until neutral pH is achieved (i.e.,
7 to 7.4).

NOTE: The volume of irrigation fluid required to
reach neutral pH varies with the chemical and
with the duration of the chemical exposure. The
volume required may range from a few liters to
many liters (more than 8 to 10 L).

3. Conjunctival fornices should be swept
with a moistened cotton-tipped applicator or glass rod to remove any sequestered
particles of caustic material and necrotic
conjunctiva, especially in the case of a persistently abnormal pH. Double eversion of
the eyelids with Desmarres eyelid retractors is especially important in identifying
and removing particles in the deep fornix.
Calcium hydroxide particles may be more
easily removed with a cotton-tipped applicator soaked in disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid.
4. Acidic or basic foreign bodies embedded in the conjunctiva, cornea, sclera, or
surrounding tissues may require surgical
debridement or removal.

MILD-TO-MODERATE BURNS
Signs

Critical. Corneal epithelial defects range
from scattered superficial punctate keratopathy (SPK), to focal epithelial loss, to sloughing of the entire epithelium. No significant

Trauma

Treatment
1. See Emergency Treatment above.
2. Cycloplegic (e.g., scopolamine 0.25%). If
limbal ischemia is suspected, avoid phenylephrine because of its vasoconstrictive
properties.
3. Topical antibiotic ointment (e.g., erythromycin) q1–2h while awake or pressure
patch for 24 hours.

3

4. Oral pain medication (e.g., acetaminophen
with or without codeine) as needed.
FIGURE 3.1.1. Alkali burn.

areas of peri limbal ischemia are seen (i.e., no
blanching of the conjunctival or episcleral
vessels).
Other. Focal areas of conjunctival epithelial
defect, chemosis, hyperemia, hemorrhages, or
a combination of these; mild eyelid edema;
mild anterior chamber (AC) reaction; firstand second-degree burns of the periocular
skin with or without lash loss.
NOTE: If you suspect an epithelial defect but do
not see one with fluorescein staining, repeat the
fluorescein application to the eye. Sometimes the
defect is slow to take up the dye. If the entire epithelium sloughs off, only Bowman membrane remains,
which may take up fluorescein poorly.

5. If IOP is elevated, acetazolamide 250 mg
p.o. q.i.d., acetazolamide 500 mg sequel p.o.
b.i.d. or methazolamide 25 to 50 mg p.o.
b.i.d. or t.i.d. may be given. Electrolytes,
especially potassium, should be monitored
in patients on these medications. Add a
topical beta-blocker (e.g., timolol 0.5%
b.i.d.) if additional IOP control is required.
Alpha-agonists may be avoided because of
their vasoconstrictive properties.
6. Frequent (e.g., q1h while awake) use of
preservative-free artificial tears or gel if not
pressure patched.

Follow-Up
Daily initially and then every few days until
the corneal epithelial defect is healed. Topical steroids may then be used to reduce significant inflammation. Monitor for corneal
epithelial breakdown, stromal thinning, and
infection.

Work-Up
1. History: Time of injury? Specific type of
chemical? Time between exposure until irrigation was started? Duration of and type
of irrigation? Eye protection? Sample of
agent, package or label, or material safety
data sheets are helpful in identifying and
treating the exposing agent.
2. Slit-lamp examination with fluorescein staining. Eyelid eversion to search for foreign
bodies. Evaluate for conjunctival or corneal
ulcerations or defects. Check the intraocular
pressure (IOP). In the presence of a distorted
cornea, IOP may be most accurately measured with a Tono-Pen or pneumotonometer.
Gentle palpation may be used if necessary.

LWBK1000-C03_p13-54.indd 14

SEVERE BURNS
Signs (in addition to the above)
Critical. Pronounced chemosis and conjunctival blanching, corneal edema and opacification, a moderate-to-severe AC reaction (may
not be appreciated if the cornea is opaque).
Other. Increased IOP, second- and thirddegree burns of the surrounding skin, and
local necrotic retinopathy as a result of direct
penetration of alkali through the sclera.

Work-Up
Same as for mild-to-moderate burns.

23/12/11 2:07 AM

3.1

Treatment
1. See Emergency Treatment above.
2. Hospital admission rarely needed for close
monitoring of IOP and corneal healing.
3. Debride necrotic tissue containing foreign
matter.
4. Cycloplegic (e.g., scopolamine 0.25% or
atropine 1%, b.i.d. to t.i.d.). Avoid phenylephrine because it is a vasoconstrictor.
5. Topical antibiotic (e.g., trimethoprim/
polymyxin B or fluoroquinolone drops
q.i.d.; erythromycin or bacitracin ointment four to nine times per day).
6. Topical steroid (e.g., prednisolone acetate
1% or dexamethasone 0.1% four to nine
times per day) if significant AC or corneal
inflammation is present. May use a combination antibiotic—steroids such as tobramycin/dexamethasone drops or ointment q1–2h.
7. Consider a pressure patch between drops
or ointment.
8. Antiglaucoma medications as above if
the IOP is increased or cannot be determined.
9. Frequent (e.g., q1h while awake) use of
preservative-free artificial tears or gel if
not using frequent ointments.
10. Oral tetracyclines may also reduce collagenolysis and stromal melting (e.g., doxycycline 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.).
11. Lysis of conjunctival adhesions b.i.d. by
using a glass rod or a moistened cottontipped applicator covered with an antibiotic ointment to sweep the fornices may
be helpful. If symblepharon begins to
form despite attempted lysis, consider using a scleral shell or ring to maintain the
fornices.
12. Other considerations:
—Therapeutic soft contact lens, collagen
shield, amniotic membrane graft (e.g.,
Pro-Kera or sutured/glued), or tarsorrhaphy (usually used if healing is delayed
beyond 2 weeks).

LWBK1000-C03_p13-54.indd 15

•

Chemical Burn

15

—Ascorbate and citrate for alkali burns
has been reported to speed healing time
and allow better visual outcome. Administration has been studied intravenously
(i.v.), orally (ascorbate 500 to 2,000 mg
q.d.), and topically (ascorbate 10% q1h).
Caution in patients with renal compromise secondary to potential renal toxicity.
—If any melting of the cornea occurs, other
collagenase inhibitors may be used. (e.g.,
acetylcysteine 10% to 20% drops q4h).

3

—If the melting progresses (or the cornea
perforates), consider cyanoacrylate tissue
adhesive. An emergency patch graft or
corneal transplantation may be necessary; however, the prognosis is better if
this procedure is performed at least 12 to
18 months after the injury.

Follow-Up
These patients need to be monitored closely,
either in the hospital or daily as outpatients.
Topical steroids should be tapered after 7 to
10 days because they can promote corneal
melting. Long-term use of preservative-free
artificial tears q1–6h and lubricating ointments q.h.s to q.i.d may be required. A
severely dry eye may require a tarsorrhaphy
or a conjunctival flap. Conjunctival or limbal stem cell transplantation from the fellow
eye may be performed in unilateral injuries
that fail to heal within several weeks to several months.

SUPER GLUE (CYANOACRYLATE)
INJURY TO THE EYE
NOTE: Rapid-setting super glues harden quickly on
contact with moisture.

Treatment
1. If the eyelids are glued together, they can
be separated with gentle traction. Lashes
may need to be cut to separate the eyelids.
Misdirected lashes, hardened glue mechanically rubbing the cornea, and glue adherent
to the cornea should be carefully removed

with fine forceps. Copious irrigation with
warm normal saline or warm compresses
may be used to loosen hardened glue on
the lids, lashes, cornea, or conjunctiva.

3. Warm compresses q.i.d. may help remove
any remaining glue stuck in the lashes that
did not require urgent removal.

2. Epithelial defects are treated as corneal
abrasions (see 3.2, Corneal Abrasion).

CORNEAL ABRASION

Symptoms

Work-Up

Sharp pain, photophobia, foreign body sensation, tearing, discomfort with blinking, history of scratching, or hitting the eye.

1. Slit-lamp examination: Use fluorescein dye,
measure the size (e.g., height and width)
of the abrasion, and diagram its location.
Evaluate for an AC reaction, infiltrate (underlying corneal opacification), corneal laceration, and penetrating trauma.

Signs
(See Figure 3.2.1.)
Critical. Epithelial defect that stains with
fluorescein, absence of underlying corneal
opacification (presence of which indicates
infection or inflammation).

2. Evert the eyelids to ensure that no foreign
body is present, especially in the presence
of vertical or linear abrasions.

Other. Conjunctival injection, swollen eyelid, mild AC reaction.

Erosion).
 Herpes simplex keratitis (see 4.15, Herpes

Simplex Virus).
 Confluent SPK (see 4.1, Superficial Punctate

Keratopathy).

1. Antibiotic
—Noncontact lens wearer: Antibiotic ointment (e.g., erythromycin, bacitracin, or
bacitracin/polymyxin B q2–4h) or antibiotic drops (e.g., polymyxin B/trimethoprim
or a fluoroquinolone q.i.d.). Abrasions secondary to fingernails or vegetable matter
should be covered with a fluoroquinolone
drop (e.g., ciprofloxacin, moxifloxacin) or
ointment (e.g., ciprofloxacin) at least q.i.d.
—Contact lens wearer: Must have antipseudomonal coverage. May use antibiotic ointment or antibiotic drops at least q.i.d.
NOTE: The decision to use drops versus ointment
depends on the needs of the patient. Ointments
offer better barrier and lubricating function
between eyelid and abrasion but tend to blur
vision temporarily. They may be used to augment
drops at bedtime. We prefer frequent ointments.

FIGURE 3.2.1. Corneal abrasion with fluorescein

2. Cycloplegic agent (e.g., cyclopentolate 1%
to 2% b.i.d or t.i.d.) for traumatic iritis which
may develop 24 to 72 hours after trauma.

23/12/11 2:07 AM

•

Avoid steroid use for iritis with epithelial defects because it may retard epithelial healing
and increase the risk of infection. Avoid use
of long-acting cycloplegics for small abrasions to allow for faster visual recovery.
3. Patching is rarely necessary. Patching may
be helpful for comfort, but DO NOT patch
if the mechanism of injury involves vegetable matter, fingernails, or if the patient
wears contact lenses. Be careful that the
patch is properly placed so that the upper
lid is totally prevented from opening as this
can cause a serious abrasion.
4. Consider topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) drops (e.g., ketorolac 0.4%
to 0.5% q.i.d. for 3 days) for pain control.
Avoid in patients with other ocular surface
disease and in postoperative patients. Oral acetaminophen, NSAIDs, or narcotics (in severe
cases) can also be used for pain control.
5. Debride loose or hanging epithelium because it may inhibit healing. A cotton-tipped
applicator soaked in topical anesthetic (e.g.,
proparacaine) or a sterile jewelers forceps
(used with caution) may be utilized.
6. No contact lens wear. Some clinicians use
bandage contact lenses for therapy. We rarely do unless the size of the abrasion and discomfort warrants it and there is poor healing in the absence of infection. If a bandage

contact lens is used, patients should use
prophylactic topical antibiotics (e.g., polymyxin B/trimethoprim or a fluoroquinolone
q.i.d.) and should be followed-up daily for
evaluation and contact lens replacement.

Follow-Up
Noncontact Lens Wearer
1. If patched or given bandage contact lens, the
patient should return in 24 hours (or sooner
if the symptoms worsen) for re-evaluation.

3

2. Central or large corneal abrasion: Return
the next day to determine if the epithelial
defect is improving. If the abrasion is healing, may see 2 to 3 days later. Instruct the
patient to return sooner if symptoms worsen. Revisit every 3 to 5 days until healed.
3. Peripheral or small abrasion: Return 2 to
5 days later. Instruct the patient to return
sooner if symptoms worsen. Revisit every 3
to 5 days until healed.
Contact Lens Wearer
Close follow-up until the epithelial defect
resolves, and then treat with topical fluoroquinolone or tobramycin drops for an additional
1 or 2 days. The patient may resume contact
lens wear after the eye feels normal for a week
after the cession of a proper course of medication. A new contact lens should be instituted
at that time.

4. Dilate the eye and examine the posterior
segment for a possible IOFB (see 3.15, Intraocular Foreign Body).
5. Consider a B-scan ultrasonography, a computed tomography (CT) scan of the orbit
(axial and coronal views, 1-mm sections),
or ultrasonographic biomicroscopy (UBM)
to exclude an intraocular or intraorbital
foreign body. Avoid magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) if there is a history of possible metallic foreign body.

the size, weight, velocity, force, shape, and
composition of the object.
2. Document visual acuity before any procedure is performed. One or two drops of topical anesthetic may be necessary to control
blepharospasm and pain.
3. Slit-lamp examination: Locate and assess the
depth of the foreign body. Examine closely for
possible entry sites (rule out self-sealing lacerations) pupil irregularities, iris tears and transillumination defects (TIDs), capsular perforations, lens opacities, hyphema, AC shallowing
(or deepening in scleral perforations), and
asymmetrically low IOP in the involved eye.
NOTE: There may be multiple IOFBs with power
equipment or explosive debris.

If there is no evidence of perforation, evert
the eyelids and inspect the fornices for additional foreign bodies. Double everting the
upper eyelid with a Desmarres eyelid retractor may be necessary. Carefully inspect a conjunctival laceration to rule out a scleral laceration or perforation. Measure the dimensions
of any infiltrate and the degree of any AC
reaction for monitoring therapy response
and progression of possible infection.
NOTE: An infiltrate accompanied by a significant
AC reaction, purulent discharge, or extreme conjunctival injection and pain should be cultured to
rule out an infection, treated aggressively with
antibiotics, and followed intensively (see 4.11,
Bacterial Keratitis).

LWBK1000-C03_p13-54.indd 18

Corneal Foreign Body (Superficial or Partial Thickness)
1. Apply topical anesthetic (e.g., proparacaine).
Remove the corneal foreign body with a
foreign body spud, fine forceps, or smallgauge needle at a slit lamp. Multiple superficial foreign bodies may be more easily
removed by irrigation.
NOTE: If there is concern for full-thickness corneal
foreign body, exploration and removal should be
performed in the operating room.

2. Remove the rust ring as completely as possible on the first attempt. This may require
an ophthalmic burr (see Figure 3.3.2). It is
sometimes safer to leave a deep, central rust
ring to allow time for the rust to migrate to
the corneal surface, at which point it can be
removed more easily.
3. Measure the size of the resultant corneal
epithelial defect.

they will surface with time, at which point
they may be removed more easily. Conjunctival excision is sometimes indicated.

NOTE: Erythromycin ointment should not be
used for residual epithelial defects from corneal foreign bodies as it does not provide strong
enough antibiotic coverage.

—Check the pH if an associated chemical
injury is suspected (e.g., alkali from fireworks). See 3.1, Chemical Burn.

5. Alert the patient to return as soon as possible if there is any worsening of symptoms.
Conjunctival Foreign Body
1. Remove foreign body under topical anesthesia.
—Multiple or loose superficial foreign bodies
can often be removed with saline irrigation.
—A foreign body can be removed with a
cotton-tipped applicator soaked in topical
anesthetic or with fine forceps. For deeply
embedded foreign bodies, consider pretreatment with a cotton-tipped applicator
soaked in phenylephrine 2.5% to reduce
conjunctival bleeding.
—Small, relatively inaccessible, buried subconjunctival foreign bodies may sometimes
be left in the eye without harm unless they are
infectious or proinflammatory. Occasionally

3.4

3. See 3.4, Conjunctival Laceration if there is a
significant conjunctival laceration.
4. A topical antibiotic (e.g., bacitracin ointment, trimethoprim/polymyxin B drops, or
fluoroquinolone drops q.i.d.) may be used.
5. Preservative-free artificial tears may be given as needed for irritation.

Follow-Up
1. Corneal foreign body: Follow-up as with
corneal abrasion (see 3.2, Corneal Abrasion).
If residual rust ring remains, re-evaluate in
24 hours.
2. Conjunctival foreign body: Follow-up as
needed, or in 1 week if residual foreign bodies were left in the conjunctiva.

CONJUNCTIVAL LACERATION

Symptoms
Mild pain, red eye, foreign body sensation;
usually, a history of ocular trauma.

Signs
Fluorescein staining of the conjunctiva. The
conjunctiva may be torn and rolled up on
itself. Exposed white sclera may be noted.
Conjunctival and subconjunctival hemorrhages are often present.

Work-Up
1. History: Determine the nature of the
trauma and whether a ruptured globe or
intraocular or intraorbital foreign body
may be present. Evaluate the mechanism
for possible foreign body involvement,

2. Sweep the conjunctival fornices with a glass
rod or cotton-tipped applicator soaked with
a topical anesthetic to remove any remaining pieces.

including size, shape, weight, and velocity of object.
2. Complete ocular examination, including careful exploration of the sclera (after topical anesthesia, e.g., proparacaine or viscous lidocaine)
in the region of the conjunctival laceration to
rule out a scleral laceration or a subconjunctival foreign body. The entire area of sclera under
the conjunctival laceration must be inspected.
Since the conjunctiva is mobile, inspect a wide
area of the sclera under the laceration. Use a
proparacaine-soaked, sterile cotton-tipped applicator to manipulate the conjunctiva. Irrigation with saline may be helpful in removing
scattered debris. A Seidel test may be helpful
(see Appendix 5, Seidel Test to Detect a Wound
Leak). Dilated fundus examination, especially

Trauma

evaluating the area underlying the conjunctival injury, must be carefully performed with
indirect ophthalmoscopy.
3. Consider a CT scan of the orbit (axial and
coronal views, 1-mm sections) to exclude
an intraocular or intraorbital foreign body.
B-scan ultrasound may be helpful.

3

4. Exploration of the site in the operating
room under general anesthesia may be necessary when a ruptured globe is suspected,
especially in children.
5. Children often do not give an accurate history of trauma. They and nearby observers
must be questioned and ophthalmic examination must be especially detailed.

Treatment
In case of a ruptured globe or penetrating
ocular injury, see 3.14, Ruptured Globe and Penetrating Ocular Injury. Otherwise:

3.5

2. Most lacerations will heal without surgical
repair. Some large lacerations (≥1 to 1.5 cm)
may be sutured with 8-0 polyglactin 910
(e.g., Vicryl). When suturing, take care not
to bury folds of conjunctiva or incorporate
Tenon capsule into the wound. Avoid suturing the plica semilunaris or caruncle to
the conjunctiva.

Follow-Up
If there is no concomitant ocular damage,
patients with large conjunctival lacerations
are re-examined within 1 week. Patients with
small injuries are seen as needed and told to
return immediately if there is a worsening of
symptoms.

TRAUMATIC IRITIS

Symptoms
Dull, aching or throbbing pain, photophobia,
tearing, onset of symptoms usually within
3 days of trauma.

Signs
Critical. White blood cells (WBCs) and
flare in the AC (seen under high-power magnification by focusing into the AC with a
small, bright, tangential beam from the slit
lamp).
Other. Pain in the traumatized eye when
light enters either eye; lower (due to ciliary
body shock) or higher (due to inflammatory debris and/or trabeculitis) IOP; smaller,
poorly dilating pupil or larger pupil (due to
iris sphincter tears) in the traumatized eye;
perilimbal conjunctival injection; decreased
vision; occasionally floaters.

Differential Diagnosis
 Nongranulomatous anterior uveitis: No

history of trauma, or the degree of trauma

is not consistent with the level of inflammation. See 12.1, Anterior Uveitis (Iritis/
Iridocyclitis).
 Traumatic microhyphema or hyphema: Red

blood cells (RBCs) suspended in the AC. See
3.6, Hyphema and Microhyphema.
 Traumatic corneal abrasion: May have an

accompanying AC reaction. See 3.2, Corneal
Abrasion.
 Traumatic retinal detachment: May produce

an AC reaction or may see pigment in the anterior vitreous. See 11.3, Retinal Detachment.

Work-Up
Complete ophthalmic examination, including IOP measurement and dilated fundus
examination.

Treatment
Cycloplegic agent (e.g., cyclopentolate 2%
t.i.d. or scopolamine 0.25% b.i.d.). May use
a steroid drop (e.g., prednisolone acetate

23/12/11 2:07 AM

3.6

0.125% to 1% q.i.d.). Avoid topical steroids if
an epithelial defect is present.

Follow-Up
1. Recheck in 5 to 7 days.

•

Hyphema and Microhyphema

3. One month after trauma, perform gonioscopy to look for angle recession and
indirect ophthalmoscopy with scleral depression to detect retinal breaks or detachment.

2. If resolved, the cycloplegic agent is discontinued and the steroid is tapered.

3.6

HYPHEMA AND MICROHYPHEMA

TRAUMATIC HYPHEMA
Symptoms
Pain, blurred vision, history of blunt trauma.

Signs
(See Figure 3.6.1.)
Blood or clot or both in the AC, usually visible
without a slit lamp. A total (100%) hyphema
may be black or red. When black, it is called
an “8-ball” or “black ball” hyphema, indicating deoxygenated blood; when red, the circulating blood cells may settle with time to
become less than a 100% hyphema.

Work-Up
1. History: Mechanism (including force, velocity, type, and direction) of injury? Protective eyewear? Time of injury? Time and
extent of visual loss? Usually the visual
compromise occurs at the time of injury; decreasing vision over time suggests a rebleed

or continued bleed (which may cause an
IOP rise). Use of medications with anticoagulant properties (aspirin, NSAIDs, warfarin,
or clopidogrel)? Personal or family history
of sickle cell disease or trait? Symptoms of
coagulopathy (e.g., bloody nose blowing,
bleeding gums with tooth brushing, easy
bruising, bloody stool)?
2. Ocular examination, first ruling out a ruptured globe (see 3.14, Ruptured Globe and
Penetrating Ocular Injury). Evaluate for other
traumatic injuries. Document the extent
(e.g., measure the hyphema height) and
location of any clot and blood. Measure
the IOP. Perform a dilated retinal evaluation without scleral depression. Consider a
gentle B-scan ultrasound if the view of the
fundus is poor. Avoid gonioscopy unless intractable increased IOP develops. If gonioscopy is necessary, perform gently. Consider
UBM to evaluate the anterior segment if the
view is poor and lens capsule rupture, IOFB,
or other anterior-segment abnormalities are
suspected.
3. Consider a CT scan of the orbits and brain
(axial and coronal views, with 1-mm sections through the orbits) when indicated
(e.g., suspected orbital fracture or IOFB, loss
of consciousness).
4. Patients should be screened for sickle cell
trait or disease (order Sickledex screen; if
necessary, may check hemoglobin electrophoresis) as clinically appropriate.

Treatment
FIGURE 3.6.1. Hyphema.

LWBK1000-C03_p13-54.indd 21

Many aspects remain controversial, including
whether hospitalization and absolute bed rest

23/12/11 2:07 AM

22

C H AP T E R

3•

Trauma

are necessary, but an atraumatic upright environment is essential. Consider hospitalization for noncompliant patients, patients with
bleeding diathesis or blood dyscrasia, patients
with other severe ocular or orbital injuries,
and patients with concomitant significant IOP
elevation and sickle cell. In addition, consider
hospitalization and aggressive treatment for
children, especially those at risk for amblyopia
(e.g., those under age 7 to 10), when a thorough clinical exam is difficult, or when child
abuse is suspected.
1. Confine either to bed rest with bathroom
privileges or to limited activity. Elevate the
head of bed to allow blood to settle. Discourage bending or heavy lifting.
2. Place a shield (metal or clear plastic) over
the involved eye at all times. Do not patch
because this prevents recognition of sudden visual change in the event of a rebleed.
3. Atropine 1% solution b.i.d. to t.i.d. or scopolamine 0.25% b.i.d. to t.i.d.
4. Avoid aspirin-containing products or NSAIDs
unless otherwise medically necessary. Consult with prescribing physicians regarding
the need for anticoagulant therapy.
5. Mild analgesics only (e.g., acetaminophen).
Avoid sedatives.
6. Use topical steroids (e.g., prednisolone acetate 1% q.i.d. to q1h) if any suggestion of
iritis (e.g., photophobia, deep ache, ciliary
flush), evidence of lens capsule rupture, any
protein (e.g., fibrin), or definitive WBCs in
AC. Taper the frequency of steroids quickly
as soon as signs and symptoms resolve to
reduce the likelihood of steroid-induced
glaucoma.
NOTE: No definitive evidence exists regarding
the use of steroids in improving outcomes for
hyphemas. Use must be balanced with the risks
of topical steroids (increased infection potential,
increased IOP, cataract). In children, particular
caution must be used regarding topical steroids.
Children often get rapid rises in IOP and with
prolonged use there is a significant risk for cataract. As outlined above, in certain cases steroids
may be beneficial, but steroids should be prescribed in an individualized manner. Children

LWBK1000-C03_p13-54.indd 22

must be monitored closely for increased IOP
and should be tapered off the steroids as soon
as possible.

7. For increased IOP:
NOTE: Increased IOP, especially soon after trauma, may be transient, secondary to acute mechanical plugging of the trabecular meshwork.
Elevating the patient’s head may decrease the
IOP by causing RBCs to settle inferiorly and clot.

—Non—sickle-cell disease or trait (≥30 mm
Hg):
• Start with a beta-blocker (e.g., timolol or
levobunolol 0.5% b.i.d.).
• If IOP is still high, add topical alphaagonist (e.g., apraclonidine 0.5% or
brimonidine 0.15% t.i.d.) or topical
carbonic anhydrase inhibitor (e.g., dorzolamide 2% or brinzolamide 1% t.i.d.).
Avoid prostaglandin analogs and miotics
(may increase inflammation). In children under 5, topical alpha-agonists are
contraindicated.
• If topical therapy fails, add acetazolamide
(500 mg p.o. q12h for adults, 20 mg/kg/
day divided three times per day for children) or mannitol [1 to 2 g/kg i.v. over
45 minutes q24h]. If mannitol is necessary to control the IOP, surgical evacuation may be imminent.
—Sickle-cell disease or trait (≥24 mm Hg):
• Start with a beta-blocker (e.g., timolol or
levobunolol 0.5% b.i.d.).
• All other agents must be used with
extreme caution: Topical dorzolamide
and brinzolamide may reduce aqueous
pH and induce increased sickling; topical alpha-agonists (e.g., brimonidine or
apraclonidine) may affect iris vasculature;
miotics and prostaglandins may promote
inflammation.
• If possible, avoid systemic diuretics because
they promote sickling by inducing
systemic acidosis and volume contraction. If a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor

23/12/11 2:07 AM

3.6

is necessary, use methazolamide 50 mg
p.o. q8h instead of acetazolamide (controversial). If mannitol is necessary to
control the IOP, surgical evacuation may
be imminent.
• AC paracentesis may be considered if
IOP cannot be safely lowered medically
(see Appendix 13, Anterior Chamber Paracentesis). This procedure is often only a
temporizing measure when the need for
surgical evacuation is anticipated.
8. If hospitalized, use antiemetics p.r.n. for
severe nausea or vomiting [e.g., prochlorperazine 10 mg intramuscularly (i.m.) q8h
or 25 mg q12h p.r.n.; ≤12 years of age, trimethobenzamide suppositories, 100 mg PR
q6h p.r.n.].
9. Indications for surgical evacuation of
hyphema:
—Corneal stromal blood staining.
—Significant visual deterioration.
—Hyphema that does not decrease to ≤50%
by 8 days (to prevent peripheral anterior
synechiae).
—IOP ≥60 mm Hg for ≥48 hours, despite
maximal medical therapy (to prevent optic
atrophy).
—IOP ≥25 mm Hg with total hyphema for
≥5 days (to prevent corneal stromal blood
staining).
—IOP 24 mm Hg for ≥24 hours (or any
transient increase in IOP ≥30 mm Hg) in
sickle trait or disease patients.
—Consider early surgical intervention for
children at risk for amblyopia.
NOTE: Previously, systemic aminocaproic acid
was used in hospitalized patients to stabilize the
clot and to prevent rebleeding. This therapy is
rarely used now. Topical aminocaproic acid is
currently under research and development. Preliminary studies suggest that it may be useful in
reducing the risk of rebleeding. Further research
is needed before the role for topical aminocaproic acid in the management of hyphemas can
be determined.

Hyphema and Microhyphema

23

Follow-Up
1. The patient should be seen daily after initial
trauma to check visual acuity, IOP, and for a
slit-lamp examination. Look for new bleeding (most commonly occurs within the first
5 to 10 days), increased IOP, corneal blood
staining, and other intraocular injuries as the
blood clears (e.g., iridodialysis; subluxated
or dislocated lens, or cataract). Hemolysis,
which may appear as bright red fluid, should
be distinguished from a rebleed, which forms
a new, bright red clot. If the IOP is increased,
treat as described earlier. Time between visits
may be increased once consistent improvement in clinical exam is documented.

3

2. The patient should be instructed to return
immediately if a sudden increase in pain or
decrease in vision is noted (which may be
symptoms of a rebleed or increased IOP).
3. If a significant rebleed or an intractable IOP
increase occurs, hospitalization or surgical
evacuation should be considered.
4. After the initial close follow-up period,
the patient may be maintained on a longacting cycloplegic (e.g., atropine 1% solution q.d. to b.i.d., scopolamine 0.25% q.d.
to b.i.d.), depending on the severity of the
condition. Topical steroids may be tapered
as the blood, fibrin, and WBCs resolve.
5. Glasses or eye shield during the day and eye
shield at night. As with any patient, protective eyewear (polycarbonate shatterproof
lenses) should be worn any time significant
potential for an eye injury exists.
6. The patient must refrain from strenuous
physical activities (including bearing down or
Valsalva maneuvers) for 1 week after the initial injury or rebleed. Normal activities may
be resumed once the hyphema has resolved
and patient is out of rebleed time frame.
7. Future outpatient follow-up:
—If the patient was hospitalized, see 2 to
3 days after discharge. If not hospitalized,
see several days to 1 week after initial daily
follow-up period, depending on the severity of condition (amount of blood, potential for IOP increase, other ocular or orbital
pathologic processes).

Trauma

—Four weeks after trauma for gonioscopy
and dilated fundus examination with
scleral depression for all patients.
—Some experts suggest annual follow-up
because of the potential for development
of angle-recession glaucoma.

—If any complications arise, more frequent
follow-up is required.
—If filtering surgery was performed, followup and activity restrictions are based on the
surgeon’s specific recommendations.

TRAUMATIC MICROHYPHEMA
Symptoms
See Hyphema above.

Signs
Suspended RBCs only in the AC, visible only
with a slit lamp. Sometimes there may be
enough suspended RBCs to see a haziness of
the AC (e.g., poor visualization of iris details)
without a slit lamp; in these cases, the RBCs
may settle out as a frank hyphema.

Work-Up
See Hyphema above.

NONTRAUMATIC (SPONTANEOUS) AND
POSTSURGICAL HYPHEMA OR MICROHYPHEMA
Symptoms
May present with decreased vision or with
transient visual loss (intermittent bleeding
may cloud vision temporarily).

Etiology of Spontaneous Hyphema or
Microhyphema
 Occult trauma: must be excluded, evaluate

for child or elder abuse.
 Neovascularization of the iris or angle (e.g.,

from diabetes, old central retinal vein occlusion, ocular ischemic syndrome, chronic
uveitis).
 Blood dyscrasias and coagulopathies.
 Iris–intraocular lens chafing.
 Herpetic keratouveitis.
 Use of anticoagulants (e.g., ethanol, aspirin,

warfarin).
 Other (e.g., iris microaneurysm, leukemia,

iris or ciliary body melanoma, retinoblastoma, juvenile xanthogranuloma, Fuchs
heterochromic iridocyclitis).

Treatment

Work-Up

1. Most microhyphemas can be treated on an
outpatient basis.

As for traumatic hyphemas, plus:

2. Scopolamine 0.25% b.i.d. or atropine 1%
q.d. In children, scopolamine is usually
preferred.
3. Otherwise, see treatment for Hyphema
above.

Follow-Up
1. The patient should return on the third day
after the initial trauma and again at 1 week.
If the IOP is >25 mm Hg at presentation,
the patient should be followed for 3 consecutive days for pressure monitoring, and
again at 1 week. Sickle-cell–positive patients
with initial IOP of ≥24 mm Hg should also
be followed for 3 consecutive days.
2. Otherwise, see follow-up for hyphema
above.

LWBK1000-C03_p13-54.indd 24

1. Gentle gonioscopy initially to evaluate neovascularization or masses in the angle.
2. Consider the following studies:
—Prothrombin time/INR, partial thromboplastin time, complete blood count with
platelet count, bleeding time, proteins C
and S.
—Fluorescein angiogram of iris.
—UBM to evaluate position of intraocular
lens haptics, ciliary body masses or other
anterior-segment pathology.

Treatment
Cycloplegia with atropine 1% solution q.d.
to t.i.d., or scopolamine 0.25% q.d. to t.i.d.,
limited activity, elevation of head of bed,
and avoidance of medically unnecessary

surgical hyphemas and microhyphemas are
usually self-limited and often require observation only, with close attention to IOP.

IRIDODIALYSIS/CYCLODIALYSIS

Definitions
Iridodialysis: Disinsertion of the iris from the
scleral spur. Elevated IOP can result from damage to the trabecular meshwork or from the
formation of peripheral anterior synechiae.

3

Open-Angle Glaucoma), angle recession, and
hypotony syndrome (see 13.11, Hypotony Syndrome). Other signs of trauma include hyphema,
cataract and pupillary irregularities.

Differential Diagnosis

Cyclodialysis: Disinsertion of the ciliary body
from the scleral spur. Increased uveoscleral
outflow occurs initially resulting in hypotony.
IOP elevation can later result from closure of a
cyclodialysis cleft, leading to glaucoma.

In setting of glaucoma, see 9.1, Primary OpenAngle Glaucoma.

Symptoms

Treatment

Usually asymptomatic unless glaucoma or
hypotony/hypotony maculopathy develop.
Large iridodialyses may be associated with
monocular diplopia, glare, and photophobia.
Both are associated with blunt trauma or penetrating globe injuries. Typically unilateral.

1. Sunglasses, contact lenses with an artificial
pupil, or surgical correction if large iridodialysis and patient symptomatic.

Signs
(See Figure 3.7.1.)
Critical. Characteristic gonioscopic findings
as described above.
Other. Decreased or elevated IOP, glaucomatous optic nerve changes (see 9.1, Primary

Work-Up
See 9.6, Angle-Recession Glaucoma.

2. If glaucoma develops, treatment is similar
to that for primary open-angle glaucoma (see
9.1, Primary Open-Angle Glaucoma). Aqueous
suppressants are usually first-line therapy.
Miotics are generally avoided because they
may reopen cyclodialysis clefts, causing hypotony. Strong mydriatics may close clefts,
resulting in pressure spikes. Often these
spikes are transient, as the meshwork resumes aqueous filtration.
3. If hypotony syndrome develops due to
cyclodialysis clefts, first-line treatment is
usually atropine b.i.d to approximate the
ciliary body to the sclera and steroids to
decrease inflammation. Further surgical
treatment as described in section 13.11,
Hypotony Syndrome.

Follow-Up
1. See section 9.1, Primary Open-Angle Glaucoma.

FIGURE 3.7.1. Iridodialysis.

LWBK1000-C03_p13-54.indd 25

2. Carefully monitor both eyes due to the
high incidence of delayed open-angle and
steroid-response glaucoma in the uninvolved as well as the traumatized eye.

EYELID LACERATION

Symptoms
Periorbital pain, tearing.

Signs

3

(See Figure 3.8.1.)
Partial or full-thickness defect in the eyelid
involving the skin and subcutaneous tissues.
Superficial laceration/abrasion may mask a
deep laceration or injury to the lacrimal drainage system (e.g., puncta, canaliculi, common
canaliculus, lacrimal sac), the orbit, globe, or
cranial vault.

Work-Up
1. History: Determine the mechanism of injury: bite, foreign body potential, etc.
2. Complete ocular examination, including
bilateral dilated fundus evaluation. Make
sure there is no injury to the globes and
optic nerves before attempting eyelid repair.
NOTE: In cases of deep eyelid lacerations, extensive examination of the underlying cornea and
sclera should be undertaken to ensure no lacerations and/or corneal, scleral, or IOFBs.

3. Determine the depth of the laceration (can
look deceptively superficial). Flip lids, and
use toothed forceps or cotton-tipped applicators to gently pull open one edge of the

FIGURE 3.8.1. Marginal eyelid laceration.

LWBK1000-C03_p13-54.indd 26

wound to determine the depth of penetration.
4. CT scan of brain and orbits (axial and coronal views, 1- to 2-mm sections) should be
obtained with any history suggestive of
penetrating injury or severe blunt trauma
to rule out fracture, retained foreign body,
ruptured globe, or intracranial injury. Loss
of consciousness usually mandates a CT
scan of the brain. Depending on the mechanism of injury, the cervical spine may
need to be cleared.
5. If laceration is nasal to either the upper or
lower eyelid punctum, even if not obviously through the canalicular system, perform punctal dilation and irrigation of the
canalicular system to exclude canalicular
involvement (see Figures 3.8.2 and 3.8.3,
and Appendix 7, Technique for Diagnostic
Probing and Irrigation of the Lacrimal System).
6. Be suspicious in glancing blunt trauma to
the cheek or zygoma. This type of blow puts
tremendous stress on the medial canthal
anatomy and may result in avulsion of the
medial canthus with concomitant canalicular laceration. This type of laceration may
be missed because of the blunt mechanism
and because the medial canthal tissues often reappose into a reasonable position,
camouflaging the extent of the injury.

—Involving the lacrimal drainage apparatus (i.e., punctum, canaliculus, common duct, or lacrimal sac), except when
uncomplicated and near the punctum in
a cooperative patient. Note that repair of
canalicular lacerations is not an ophthalmic emergency. Repair can be delayed
for 3 to 7 days with no negative effects.
—Involving the levator aponeurosis of
the upper eyelid (producing ptosis) or
the superior rectus muscle.

FIGURE 3.8.3. Canalicular laceration showing
exposed tip after probing the punctum.

NOTE: Dog bites are notorious for causing canalicular lacerations. Probing should be performed
in all such cases, even with lacerations that appear to be superficial. With uncooperative children, conscious sedation or an examination under anesthesia may be necessary to thoroughly
examine the eyelids and globes.

Treatment
1. Consider tetanus prophylaxis (see Appendix 2, Tetanus Prophylaxis, for indications).
2. Give systemic antibiotics if contamination or foreign body is suspected [e.g., dicloxacillin or cephalexin, 250 to 500 mg
p.o. q.i.d. (adults); 25 to 50 mg/kg/day
divided into four doses (children); for human or animal bites, consider penicillin
V (same dose as dicloxacillin)]. Continue
for 5 to 7 days. For animal bites, if indicated, consider rabies prophylaxis.
NOTE: In most states, animal bites are required to be reported to the local department
of health.

—Visible orbital fat in an eyelid laceration, indicating penetration of the
orbital septum. All such patients require
CT imaging and careful documentation
of levator and extraocular muscle function. Exploration of deeper tissue planes
may be necessary.
—Medial canthal tendon avulsion
(exhibits displacement, excessive rounding, or abnormal laxity of the medial
canthus).
—Extensive tissue loss (especially more
than one-third of the eyelid) or severe
distortion of anatomy.

Procedure for eyelid lacerations repairable in the
minor surgical environment:
4. Clean the area of injury and the surrounding skin (e.g., copious irrigation
and ophthalmic povidone–iodine).
5. Administer local subcutaneous anesthetic (e.g., 2% lidocaine with epinephrine).
Since direct injection of local anesthetic
causes tissue distortion and bleeding,
use the minimal amount of anesthetic
needed or perform field blocks (e.g., supraorbital and/or infraorbital nerves).
6. Irrigate the wound aggressively with saline in a syringe and angiocath.

3. Assess eyelid laceration.
The following laceration characteristics are an indication for repair in the operating room and are beyond the scope of this book:
—Associated with ocular trauma requiring surgery (e.g., ruptured globe or intraorbital foreign body).

7. Explore the wound carefully for foreign
bodies. If foreign bodies are suspected,

exploration to evaluate the depth and extent of penetration. Do NOT remove any
foreign body prior to surgery if there is a
possibility of globe penetration, or extension into the orbit. If there is any possibility of deeper penetration into the orbit, cavernous sinus, or brain, the patient
requires an extensive preoperative evaluation and a multidisciplinary approach,
sometimes necessitating angiography and
ENT or neurosurgical consultation.
NOTE: Lacerations resulting from human
or animal bites or those with significant risk
of contamination may require minimal debridement of necrotic tissue. Contaminated
wounds may be left open for delayed repair,
although some believe that the excellent
blood supply of the eyelid allows for primary
repair. If electing primary repair, proceed to
the subsequent steps.

8. Isolate the surgical field with a sterile eye
drape.
9. Place a drop of topical anesthetic (e.g.,
proparacaine) into the eye. Place a protective eye shell over the eye before suturing.
10a. Marginal Eyelid Laceration Repair. Lacerations involving the eyelid margin may
be repaired by using one of many methods. Two methods are described below.
10b. Nonmarginal Eyelid Laceration Repair.
—See steps 1 to 9 above. Then close
the skin with interrupted 6-0 absorbable (e.g., plain gut) sutures. Avoid deep
sutures. Never suture the orbital septum.

proper eyelid alignment and healing.
Marginal repair alone will not provide
structural integrity to the eyelid; the
injured tarsus will splay apart, resulting
in eyelid notching (see Figure 3.8.4c).
—If unsure about patient reliability or
in patients who will not cooperate for
suture removal (e.g., young children,
patients with advanced dementia, etc.),
use absorbable 6-0 polyglactin suture
(e.g., Vicryl) in the margin, instead of
nonabsorbable silk.
—Be careful to avoid deeper, buried subcutaneous sutures that can incorporate
the orbital septum, resulting in eyelid tethering. In general, deep sutures
should be avoided outside of the tarsal
zone (upper eyelid = 10 mm from eyelid
margin, lower eyelid = 5 mm from eyelid
margin).
—Deep tarsal sutures placed anteriorly
should be lamellar (half thickness), especially in the upper eyelid, to avoid penetration through the underlying conjunctiva and a subsequent corneal abrasion.
Procedure Steps—Traditional Method
(See Figure 3.8.4.)
A. Place a 6-0 silk suture from gray line to gray
line, entering and exiting the gray line 2 to
3 mm from the laceration edge. (As already
noted, in difficult or unreliable patients,
use absorbable suture material only.) Put
the suture on traction with a hemostat
to ensure good reapproximation of the
splayed tarsus and gray line. Leave suture
untied.

Final Steps:
11. Remove the protective eye shell.
12. Apply antibiotic ointment (e.g., bacitracin
ophthalmic) to the wound t.i.d.
13. Dress the wound if appropriate and consider oral antibiotics.
Key Points:
—The most important step is to reapproximate the tarsus along its vertical
axis with several sutures to allow for

LWBK1000-C03_p13-54.indd 28

NOTE: This marginal suture provides no structural integrity to the eyelid; its main function is
to align the eyelid margin anatomy to ensure a
good cosmetic repair.

B. Realign the tarsal edges with multiple interrupted sutures placed through an anterior approach (5-0 or 6-0 polyglactin on a
spatulated needle). This is the most important step in marginal laceration closure. In
the upper eyelid, 3 to 4 sutures can usually

(e.g., Vicryl) sutures. Take partial-thickness bites. C: Failure to realign the tarsus will compromise the integrity of the

suture. F: Suture the skin with interrupted 6-0 plain gut, securing the tails of the marginal sutures.

NOTE: If patient reliability is questionable, use absorbable (e.g., 6-0 Vicryl) sutures for every step.

be placed. In the lower eyelid, 2 to 3 sutures are typically the maximum. A single
tarsal suture is inadequate for appropriate tarsal realignment. It is important to
take only lamellar (half-thickness) bites
through the tarsus and to avoid the underlying conjunctiva to minimize the risk of
postoperative corneal injury.

ginal extent of the laceration and extending towards the eyelid margin. Approaching the eyelid margin, pass the needle
anterior to the lash line on one side of the
laceration and come out in the lash line on
the other side of the laceration.
C. Realign the anterior lamella by passing the
needle into the parallel lash line on the
opposite side of the laceration, and come
out through the meibomian gland orifices
on the original side of the laceration. Care
must be taken to ensure even placement of
the suture to avoid lid margin override.

E. Place and tie another 6-0 silk marginal
suture either anterior or posterior to the
gray-line suture, again leaving long tails.
Frequently, the posterior suture is unnecessary and its absence decreases the risk of
postoperative corneal abrasion.

D. To realign the posterior lamella, pass the
next bite into the parallel meibomian
gland orifices and come out through the
gray line on the original side of the laceration. Then pass the needle into the parallel
gray line, and come out anterior to the lash
line on the original side.

F. Use interrupted 6-0 plain gut sutures to
close the skin along the length of the laceration. Incorporate the tails of both silk
marginal sutures into the skin suture closest to the eyelid margin to keep tails away
from corneal surface.

E. A pattern of three parallel passes through
the lash line, gray line, and meibomian
gland line is thereby achieved to reapproximate the eyelid margin without any loose
marginal sutures.

Procedure Steps—Alternative Method
(See Figure 3.8.5)
NOTE: In this method, the only knots are at the
nonmarginal edge of the wound, eliminating
the risk of corneal abrasion from suture tails.

A. Pass a 5-0 polyglactin suture, preferably
on a P2 needle (small radius of curvature,
spatulated), in a vertical mattress fashion
through the tarsal plate to realign the eyelid margin. Ensure good reapproximation
of the tarsus and gray line, then tie the
suture.
B. Close the skin using a 6-0 nylon suture in
running fashion beginning at the nonmar-

LWBK1000-C03_p13-54.indd 30

F. Run the suture back toward the nonmarginal extent of the laceration, crisscrossing the previously placed sutures. Tie the
suture securely, its tails distant from the
ocular surface.

Follow-Up
If nonabsorbable sutures are used (e.g., silk),
eyelid margin sutures should be left in place
for 5 to 10 days, and other superficial sutures
for 4 to 7 days. The integrity of an eyelid
margin repair is in the longer lasting tarsal
sutures. Therefore, the eyelid margin sutures
can be removed as soon as 5 days postoperatively. If a small notch is present, it can be followed over the ensuing 3 to 6 months to allow
for scar maturation. A small eyelid notch will
often soften and disappear on its own.

Trauma

ORBITAL BLOW-OUT FRACTURE

Symptoms

3

Pain on attempted eye movement (orbital floor
fracture: pain with vertical eye movement;
medial wall fracture: pain with horizontal eye
movement), local tenderness, eyelid edema,
binocular diplopia, crepitus (particularly after
nose blowing), recent history of trauma. Tearing may be a symptom of nasolacrimal duct
obstruction or injury seen with medial buttress, Leforte II, or nasoethmoidal complex
fractures, but this is typically a late complaint.
Acute tearing is usually due to ocular irritation
(e.g., chemosis, corneal abrasion, iritis).

Signs
Critical. Restricted eye movement (especially in upward gaze, lateral gaze, or both),
subcutaneous or conjunctival emphysema,
hypesthesia in the distribution of the infraorbital nerve (ipsilateral cheek and upper lip),
point tenderness, enophthalmos (may initially be masked by orbital edema).
Other. Nosebleed, eyelid edema, and ecchymosis. Superior rim and orbital roof fractures
may show hypesthesia in the distribution of
the supratrochlear or supraorbital nerve (ipsilateral forehead) and ptosis. Trismus, malar
flattening, and a palpable step-off deformity
of the inferior orbital rim are characteristic of
tripod (zygomatic complex) fractures. Optic
neuropathy may be present secondary to traumatic optic neuropathy (TON) or orbital compartment syndrome secondary to retrobulbar
hemorrhage (see below).

Differential Diagnosis of Muscle
Entrapment in Orbital Fracture
 Orbital edema and hemorrhage without

a blow-out fracture: May have limitation
of ocular movement, periorbital swelling,
and ecchymosis due to soft-tissue edema
and hemorrhage, but these resolve over 7
to 10 days.
 Cranial nerve palsy: Limitation of ocular

movement, but no restriction on forcedduction testing. Will have abnormal results

LWBK1000-C03_p13-54.indd 32

on force generation testing. In cases of suspected traumatic cranial neuropathy, skull
base and intracranial processes should be
ruled out with CT imaging.

Work-Up
1. Complete ophthalmologic examination, including measurement of extraocular movements and globe displacement. Compare
the sensation of the affected cheek with
that on the contralateral side; palpate the
eyelids for crepitus (subcutaneous emphysema); palpate the orbital rim for step-off
deformities; evaluate the globe carefully
for a rupture, hyphema or microhyphema,
traumatic iritis, and retinal or choroidal
damage. Measure IOP. Check pupils and
color vision to rule out a TON (see 3.11,
Traumatic Optic Neuropathy). If eyelid and
periocular edema limit the view, special
techniques may be necessary [e.g., use of
Desmarres retractors or clean paperclips
(see Figure 3.9.1), lateral cantholysis, examination under general anesthesia].
NOTE: It is of paramount importance to rule out
intraocular and optic nerve injury as quickly as
possible in ALL patients presenting with suspected orbital fracture.

NOTE: Pediatric patients are particularly at risk
for “trapdoor” fractures, as their bones tend to
be cartilaginous and bendable. Children may
have a benign external periocular appearance
with a remarkable paucity of eyelid signs but
with significant extraocular muscle restriction
(usually vertical) on examination (“white-eyed
blow-out fracture” or WEBOF). Younger children
often do not complain of binocular diplopia,
and may simply close one eye. Further, pediatric
patients may present with a severe oculocardiac
reflex (nausea or vomiting, bradycardia, syncope,
dehydration from an inability to eat or drink)
and a vague history and may therefore be misdiagnosed as having an intracranial injury (e.g.,
concussion). CT evidence of an orbital fracture
may be minimal, or may be missed if only a CT
of the head is obtained. Alternatively, CT may

show a trapdoor fracture with rectus muscle
incarceration or a “missing” inferior rectus. The
narrow configuration of the typical WEBOF is often missed on CT imaging, particularly when fine
cuts through the orbits are not obtained. Careful
examination of coronal views is critical in such
cases.

2. Forced-duction testing may be performed
if limitation of eye movement persists beyond 1 week and restriction is suspected.
Although in the early phase it is often

difficult to distinguish soft-tissue edema or
contusion from soft-tissue entrapment in
the fracture. See Appendix 6, Forced-Duction
Test and Active Force Generation Test.
3. CT of the orbit and midface (axial and coronal views, 1- to 1.5-mm sections, without
contrast) is obtained in all cases of suspected
orbital fractures. Bone windows are especially helpful in the evaluation of fractures
(see Figures 3.9.2 and 3.9.3), including the
narrow, oft-missed WEBOF. Inclusion of the

midfacial skeleton is also recommended in
such cases to rule out zygomatic complex or
LeForte fractures. If there is any history of
loss of consciousness, brain imaging is recommended.

NOTE: In the absence of visual symptoms (subjective change in vision, diplopia, periocular
pain, photophobia, floaters or flashes), patients
with orbital fractures are unlikely to have an ophthalmic condition requiring intervention within
24 hours. However, all patients with orbital fractures should undergo a complete ophthalmologic examination within 48 hours of injury. Any patient complaining of blurred vision, severe pain,
or any other significant visual symptoms should
undergo more urgent ophthalmic evaluation.

Treatment
1. Consider broad-spectrum oral antibiotics
(e.g., cephalexin 250 to 500 mg p.o. q.i.d.;
or erythromycin 250 to 500 mg p.o. q.i.d; or
doxycycline 100 mg po b.i.d.) for 7 days. Antibiotics may be considered if the patient has
a history of chronic sinusitis, diabetes, or is
otherwise immunocompromised. This is
based on limited, anecdotal evidence. In all
other patients, the decision about antibiotic
use is left to the treating physician. Prophylactic antibiotics should not be considered
mandatory in patients with orbital fractures.
2. Instruct the patient not to blow his or her
nose.
3. Nasal decongestants (e.g., oxymetazoline
nasal spray b.i.d.) for 3 days. Use is limited to 3 days to minimize the chance of
rebound nasal congestion.
4. Apply q1–2h ice packs for 20 minutes each
hour to the eyelids for the first 24 to 48 hours
and 30-degree incline when at rest.
5. Consider oral corticosteroids (e.g., Medrol
dose pack) if extensive swelling limits examination of ocular motility and globe position. Some experts advise the use of oral
antibiotics if corticosteroid therapy is considered, but there are no data to support the
effectiveness of such a regimen.
6. Neurosurgical consultation is recommended for all fractures involving the orbital

LWBK1000-C03_p13-54.indd 34

roof, frontal sinus, or cribriform plate, and
for all fractures associated with intracranial
hemorrhage. Otolaryngology or oral maxillofacial surgery consultation may be useful
for frontal sinus, midfacial, and mandibular fractures.
7. Surgical repair should be considered based
on the following criteria:
Immediate Repair (Within 24 to 72 hours)
If there is clinical evidence of muscle entrapment and nonresolving bradycardia, heart
block, nausea, vomiting, or syncope. These
may be present despite “negative” CT findings
(see above, WEBOF).
NOTE: Patients with WEBOF require urgent orbital
exploration to release any incarcerated muscle in
the hope of decreasing the chance of permanent
restrictive strabismus from muscle ischemia and
fibrosis, as well as to alleviate the systemic symptoms from the oculocardiac reflex.

Repair in 1 to 2 Weeks
—Persistent, symptomatic diplopia in primary or downgaze that has not improved
over 1 week. CT may show muscle distortion or herniation around fractures.
Forced ductions may be useful in identifying bony restriction.
—Large orbital floor fractures (>50%) or
large combined medial wall and orbital
floor fractures that are likely to cause cosmetically unacceptable enophthalmos over
time. Enophthalmos and/or hypoglobus at
initial presentation is indicative of a large
fracture. It is also reasonable to wait several
months to see if enophthalmos develops
before offering repair. There is no clear evidence that early repair is more effective in
preventing or reversing globe malposition
compared to delayed repair. However, many
surgeons prefer early repair simply because
dissection planes and abnormal (fractured)
bony anatomy is more easily discernable
before post-traumatic fibrosis sets in.
—Complex trauma involving the orbital
rim, or displacement of the lateral wall
and/or the zygomatic arch. Complex fractures of the midface (zygomatic complex,

23/12/11 2:07 AM

Leforte II) or skull base (Leforte III). Nasoethmoidal complex fractures. Superior or
superomedial orbital rim fractures involving the frontal sinuses.

Delayed Repair
—Old fractures that have resulted in
enophthalmos or hypoglobus can be
repaired at any later date.
NOTE: The role of anticoagulation in postoperative
or post-trauma patients is debatable. Anecdotal reports have described orbital hemorrhage in patients
with orbital and midfacial fractures who were anticoagulated for prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis (DVT). On the other hand, multiple large studies
have also demonstrated an increased risk of DVT and
pulmonary embolism (PE) in postoperative patients
who are obtunded or cannot ambulate. At the very
least, all in-patients with orbital fractures awaiting
surgery and all postoperative orbital fracture patients
should be placed on intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC) therapy and encouraged to ambulate.
In patients at high risk for DVT, including those who
are obtunded from concomitant intracranial injury,
a detailed discussion with the primary team regard-

ing anticoagulation should be documented, and
the risks for and against such therapy should be discussed in detail with the patient and family.

Follow-Up
Patients should be seen at 1 and 2 weeks after
trauma to be evaluated for persistent diplopia
and/or enophthalmos after the acute orbital
edema has resolved. If sinusitis symptoms
develop or were present prior to the injury,
the patient should be seen within a few days
of the injury. If only a limited fundus examination was performed initially, it should be
repeated to assure there is no peripheral retinal damage. Depending on the level of associated ocular injury, patients should also be
monitored for the development of associated
ocular injuries (e.g., orbital cellulitis, anglerecession glaucoma, and retinal detachment).
Gonioscopy of the AC angle and dilated retinal examination with scleral depression is performed 3 to 4 weeks after trauma if a hyphema
or microhyphema was present. Warning symptoms of retinal detachment and orbital cellulitis are explained to the patient.

 Spontaneous retrobulbar hemorrhage: Signs

and symptoms are identical to those of traumatic or postoperative hemorrhage. May
occur in patients who are chronically anticoagulated or with an underlying coagulopathy
from other systemic disease (e.g., hemophilia).
Occasionally reported in pregnant women.

Work-Up
1. Complete ophthalmic examination; check
specifically for an afferent pupillary defect,

LWBK1000-C03_p13-54.indd 36

loss of color vision (color plates or red desaturation), increased IOP, pulsations of the
central retinal artery (often precede artery
occlusion), and choroidal folds (sign of
globe distortion from severe optic nerve
stretching). Assess the degree of tightness
of the eyelids and any resistance to retropulsion.
2. CT orbit (axial and coronal views). When
vision and/or optic nerve function is
threatened, CT can be delayed until after
definitive treatment has been instituted.
CT rarely shows a discreet hematoma. Typically, retrobulbar hemorrhage manifests
as a diffuse, increased reticular pattern of
the intraconal orbital fat. The so-called
“teardrop” or “tenting” sign may be seen:
the optic nerve is at maximum stretch and
distorts (tents) the back of the globe into a
teardrop shape. This is an ominous radiologic sign, especially if the posterior scleral
angle is <130°.
NOTE: Retrobulbar hemorrhage is a clinical diagnosis and does not require imaging. A delay
while CT is being obtained may result in further
visual compromise. Imaging can be obtained
once the orbital compartment syndrome has
been reversed and visual function has been stabilized.

Treatment
The key to effective management of retrobulbar
hemorrhage is timely and aggressive decompression. Retrobulbar hemorrhage results in an
orbital compartment syndrome, and the initial goal is to decrease the compression on
critical soft tissue, mainly the optic nerve. All
patients should be treated utilizing the same
guidelines, even if the hemorrhage is thought
to have occurred hours or days ago (unless
intraoperative, there is no way to know when
the orbital hemorrhage reached a critical
threshold causing optic neuropathy and/or
retinal ischemia).
1. If optic neuropathy is present, immediately
release orbital pressure with lateral canthotomy and inferior cantholysis (see below and Figure 3.10.2). The procedure can
be performed in an office or ER setting with

basic instrumentation and local anesthetic
injection. Conscious sedation can be used
in the ER setting if this does not delay treatment, but is usually unnecessary.

2. If there are no orbital signs and no evidence of ocular ischemia or compressive
optic neuropathy but the IOP is increased
(e.g., ≥30 mm Hg in a patient with a normal optic nerve, or ≥20 mm Hg in a patient with glaucoma who normally has a
lower IOP), the patient is treated in a more
stepwise fashion in an effort to reduce the
IOP (see below and 9.1, Primary Open-Angle
Glaucoma).
Canthotomy and Cantholysis (See Figure 3.10.2)
The goal of canthotomy and cantholysis is to
perform an adequate soft-tissue decompression of the orbit by disinserting the lower eyelid from its periosteal attachments. The retina’s infarct time is approximately 90 minutes,
and so decreased perfusion of longer duration
as a result of an orbital compartment syndrome may lead to retinal nerve fiber death
and permanent vision loss.
NOTE: A canthotomy alone is inadequate treatment. A cantholysis also needs to be performed.

a. Subdermal injection of lidocaine 2% with
epinephrine (inject away from the eye).

chance of globe injury. Delicate forceps
(e.g., 0.12-mm Castroviejo) will not provide enough traction to effectively disinsert the eyelid and should not be used.
d. Perform the canthotomy. Place the scissors across the lateral canthus and incise
the canthus full thickness (from conjunctiva to skin). Forceps are not needed
for this step. This step simply gains
access to the inferior crux of the lateral
canthal tendon. It provides very little
soft-tissue decompression.
e. Perform inferior cantholysis. With the
toothed forceps, grasp the lower eyelid
at the inner edge of the incised canthus. With the patient supine, traction
should be directed upward, toward the
ceiling. Place the scissors in an open
position just beneath the skin, with
the tips pointing toward the tip of the
nose, and strum the lateral canthal tendon to determine its location. Begin to
cut. As the canthal tendon is released,
the eyelid should come completely
away from the globe.
NOTE: The canthotomy/cantholysis is critical
to decompress the orbit, and is done exclusively by feel. Do not search for a specific tendon or anatomic landmark.

b. Consider placing a hemostat horizontally at the lateral canthus and clamp
for 1 minute to compress the tissue and
reduce bleeding (optional step). Because
of the eyelid edema and acidotic local
environment, local anesthesia may not
be effective. A field block may be used.
The patient should be warned that the
procedure may be painful, but fortunately in most cases cantholysis can be
performed quickly.

f. There are several clues to a successful
cantholysis. The eyelid should release
completely away from the globe. Once
the forceps are released, the lateral portion of the eyelid margin should move
medially, usually to the lateral aspect
of the limbus of the globe. If any eyelid
margin still remains in its normal position lateral to the temporal limbus, the
cantholysis is incomplete: keep cutting!

c. Only two instruments are needed for
canthotomy and cantholysis: A pair of
blunt-tipped scissors (e.g., Wescott or
Stevens) and forceps with heavy teeth
(e.g., Bishop Harmon or Addson). Avoid
sharp-tipped scissors to minimize the

g. Because of the eyelid edema, the incision
will bleed. Cautery is usually unnecessary. Pressure over the bone of the lateral
orbital rim (but not on the globe and
orbit) for several minutes will usually
result in good control.

h. The results of a successful cantholysis
are usually evident within the first 15
minutes. IOP should decrease and the
retina should re-perfuse. Cadaver studies have shown a reliable correlation
between IOP and intraorbital pressure.
A significant decrease in IOP after cantholysis is indicative of a successful
orbital decompression. Depending on
the timing of the cantholysis in relation
to the hemorrhage, vision may dramatically improve. Superior cantholysis is
usually unnecessary: Cadaver studies
have not shown a dramatic decrease
in intraorbital pressure with superior
cantholysis. In addition, superior cantholysis may result in lacrimal gland
incision, which can bleed profusely. A
limited orbital floor (bony) decompression using a curved hemostat placed
blindly through the lateral canthotomy is also discouraged, because this
maneuver may lacerate the infraorbital
artery. By far the most common reason
for persistent signs of orbital compartment syndrome following cantholysis
is inadequate cantholysis. Make sure
the cantholysis is performed effectively.
3. Close observation is indicated in all cases
of orbital hemorrhage affecting visual function and in cases of acute retrobulbar hemorrhage (<6 hours), even if visual function
is normal. Most cases of postoperative hemorrhages evolve over the first 6 to 8 hours.
It is therefore dangerous to assume that
a patient with recent injury, retrobulbar
hemorrhage, and normal optic nerve function is stable enough for discharge. In such
cases, it is best to follow the patient over 8
to 12 hours with frequent serial examinations in the ER or hospital.
4. Anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin) and antiplatelet agents (e.g., aspirin) are often discontinued, if possible, to prevent rebleed.
This decision should be made in conjunction with an internist or cardiologist. Intravenous corticosteroids may be indicated
to further decrease soft-tissue edema when
no traumatic head injury is present. Antibi-

otics may be indicated, depending on the
etiology of the hemorrhage (e.g., fracture).
Frequent ice compresses (20 minutes on, 20
minutes off) are important and their compliant use should be emphasized to the patient and the nursing staff.
5. Medical IOP control as needed:
—Oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitor (e.g.,
acetazolamide, two 250-mg pills, not
extended release).

3

—Topical beta-blocker (e.g., timolol 0.5%
or levobunolol 0.5%), alpha-agonist (e.g.,
brimonidine 0.15%), or topical carbonic
anhydrase inhibitor (e.g., dorzolamide 2%
or brinzolamide 1%). May repeat each drop
after 30 minutes.
—Hyperosmotic agent (e.g., mannitol, 1 to
2 g/kg i.v. over 45 minutes).

NOTE: A 500-mL bag of mannitol 20% contains
100 g of mannitol.

Follow-Up
In cases where vision is threatened, monitor patient closely until stable, with frequent
vision and IOP checks.
Any patient with a post-traumatic orbital
hemorrhage older than 6 to 8 hours with
normal visual function should be instructed
in detail on how to serially measure visual
function, especially over the first 24 hours,
and to return immediately if vision deteriorates. Wounds may be left for spontaneous
healing, or be closed with a secondary canthoplasty within 1 to 2 weeks. If reconstruction of the lateral canthus is indicated, it may
be performed as an outpatient procedure
under local anesthesia. The inferior canthal
tendon is sutured back to the inner aspect of
the lateral orbital rim. Interestingly, a significant portion of eyelids will heal adequately
without any surgery. If a residual optic neuropathy is present, the patient should be followed with serial examinations and visual
fields. It is not uncommon for visual function to continue to improve over the first
6 months.

Signs

to compression, contusion, and/or laceration
of the optic nerve. Indirect TON is typically
due to deceleration injury with shearing of
the nerve and vascular supply in the optic
canal and less commonly due to rapid rotation of the globe leading to avulsion.

Critical. A new afferent pupillary defect in a
traumatized eye that cannot be accounted for
by previously existing ocular pathology.

 Compressive optic neuropathy from orbital

Other. Decreased color vision in the affected
eye, a visual field defect, and other signs of
trauma. The optic disc acutely appears normal in most cases of posterior indirect TON.
In cases of anterior TON, optic disc avulsion
may be obvious on funduscopic examination unless obscured by vitreous hemorrhage.
Extraocular motility may be compromised in
these cases because of associated extraocular
muscle avulsion or contusion. TON is often
associated with intracranial injury.

 Compressive optic neuropathy from orbital

NOTE: Optic disc pallor usually does not appear for
weeks after a traumatic optic nerve injury. If pallor
is present immediately after trauma, a preexisting
optic neuropathy should be suspected.

Traumatic Retrobulbar Hemorrhage.
foreign body: A subcategory of direct TON.
See 3.12, Intraorbital Foreign Body.
 Bony impingement: A posterior direct TON

that results from impingement of the apical optic nerve from a fracture at the orbital
apex. Mechanisms vary widely. Direct bony
impingement on the optic canal may result
from a skull base fracture of any structure,
including the cavernous sinus, with resultant cranial neuropathy (see Figure 3.11.1).

blood in the optic nerve sheath. Often a
presumptive diagnosis requiring an abnormal fundus appearance, typically a combination of retinal venous and arterial occlusions (e.g., central retinal artery occlusion,
central retinal vein occlusion). Progressive
visual loss may occur as the hematoma expands. In most cases, optic nerve sheath
hematoma is seen in conjunction with retinal hemorrhages and a subarachnoid intracranial bleed (Terson syndrome).

Etiology
TON is typically categorized based on location
of injury (anterior or posterior) and mechanism of injury (direct or indirect). Anterior
TON is arbitrarily defined as occurring anterior to the entrance of the central retinal artery
into the optic nerve. Direct TON is usually due

LWBK1000-C03_p13-54.indd 40

mon form of TON, specifically known as
posterior indirect TON, but often simply
referred to as TON. The head hits a static
object (steering wheel, handlebars, pavement) while the soft tissue within the orbit
continues to move forward. Since the optic
nerve is tethered at the optic canal, shearing of the nutrient pial vessels may occur
with subsequent optic nerve edema within
the confined space of the optic canal. Visual

loss from posterior indirect TON is typically
immediate and does not progress.
 Others (e.g., optic nerve laceration, optic

Work-Up
1. History: Mechanism of injury (e.g., deceleration)? Loss of consciousness, nausea and/
or vomiting, headache, clear nasal discharge
(suggestive of cerebrospinal fluid leakage)?
Past ocular history including history of amblyopia, strabismus surgery, previous optic
neuropathy, retinal detachment, glaucoma,
etc.?
2. Complete ocular examination including an
assessment of visual acuity and pupils. This
may be difficult depending on the patient’s
mental status, use of sedatives, narcotics, etc.
NOTE: If a bilateral, symmetric TON is present,
a RAPD may be absent. In addition, if an RAPD is
present, the patient may have either a unilateral
TON or a bilateral asymmetric TON. Do not assume that vision is not compromised in the fellow
eye, especially in comatose or sedated patients.

rule out an intraorbital foreign body or
bony impingement on the optic nerve.
There may be fractures along the cribriform
plate, the sphenoid sinus, and the medial
wall of the cavernous sinus. A normal CT in
no way rules out posterior indirect TON.
6. B-scan ultrasound if optic nerve head avulsion is suspected but is obscured clinically
by a hyphema, vitreous hemorrhage, or
other media opacity.

Treatment
Depends on the type of TON:
1. Compressive optic neuropathy from orbital
hemorrhage: See 3.10, Traumatic Retrobulbar Hemorrhage.
2. Compressive optic neuropathy from orbital
foreign body: See 3.12, Intraorbital Foreign
Body.
3. Optic nerve sheath hematoma: Optic nerve
sheath fenestration may be helpful in the
acute stage if optic neuropathy is progressing and no other cause is evident.
4. Optic nerve laceration: No effective treatment.

3. Color vision testing in each eye. Checking
red desaturation is a useful alternative if
color plates are not available.
4. Visual fields by confrontation. Formal visual
field testing is helpful if available.
5. CT scan of the head and orbit (coronal and
axial views) with thin (i.e., 1 mm) sections
through the optic canal and skull base to

LWBK1000-C03_p13-54.indd 41

5. Optic nerve head avulsion: No effective
treatment.
6. Deceleration injury: Effective treatment of
posterior indirect TON is, at best, extremely
limited. Given the results of the CRASH
study, high-dose corticosteroids should
never be offered by ophthalmologists to
patients with concomitant traumatic brain
injury (TBI) or if the TON is older than

23/12/11 2:07 AM

Trauma

8 hours. In the vast majority of cases, we
recommend observation alone. If steroids
are considered (no evidence of TBI, injury
within 8-hour window, no medical comorbidities), the lack of definitive therapeutic
evidence and significant side effects must
be discussed with the patient and/or family
and the primary team. Dosing of methylprednisolone includes a loading dose of 30
mg/kg and then 5.4 mg/kg q6h for 48 hours.
Histamine type 2 receptor antagonists should
be given concomitantly.
7. Bone impingement of the optic canal: Endoscopic optic canal and orbital apex decompression may be offered in select cases,
especially if the optic neuropathy is progressive. However, this option should be
approached with extreme caution because
of the proximity to the cavernous sinus and
carotid siphon and possible bony instability
of the skull base. The procedure should only
be performed by an otolaryngologist experienced in stereotactic endoscopic sinus and
skull base surgery. The patient and/or family should also be informed that there is no
definitive data that proves efficacy of this
procedure in TON and that optic canal decompression may result in additional damage to the intracanalicular optic nerve.

3.12

Follow-Up
For cases of indirect TON, vision, pupillary
reactions, and color vision must be evaluated
daily for 1 to 2 days, especially in cases where
progression is suspected. If a secondary etiology
is causing a TON, follow-up may be closer and
longer, and depend on the intervention offered.
If facial and orbital fracture repair is indicated,
it is crucial to document the preoperative visual
acuity and visual fields, and to explain to the
patient and family that TON is present in order
to avoid later claims of iatrogenic optic nerve
injury. In comatose patients with suspected
TON who require facial or orbital fracture
repair, the family should be informed that only
limited assessment of visual function is possible
preoperatively, but significant traumatic visual
compromise may have occurred. Anecdotally,
mild-to-moderate posterior indirect TON may
show significant spontaneous improvement
over 3 to 6 months, while severe initial visual
loss seems to carry a worse prognosis.

ultrasonography, or a combination of these.
Other. A palpable orbital mass, limitation of
ocular motility, proptosis, eyelid or conjunctival laceration, erythema, edema, or ecchymosis of eyelids. The presence of an afferent
pupillary defect may indicate TON.

of suspicion in all trauma. Remember that
children are notoriously poor historians.
2. Complete ocular and periorbital examination
with special attention to pupillary reaction,
IOP, and retinal evaluation. Carefully examine for an entry wound. Rule out occult globe
rupture. Gentle gonioscopy may be needed.

FIGURE 3.12.2.

CT of intraorbital foreign body.

Types of Foreign Bodies
1. Poorly tolerated (often lead to inflammation or infection): Organic (e.g., wood or
vegetable matter), chemical [e.g., diesel fuel
(see Figure 3.12.3)], and certain retinotoxic
metallic foreign bodies (especially copper).
2. Fairly well tolerated (typically produce a
chronic low-grade inflammatory reaction): Alloys that are <85% copper (e.g., brass, bronze).
3. Well tolerated (inert materials): Stone, glass,
plastic, iron, lead, steel, aluminum, and
most other metals and alloys, assuming that
they were relatively clean on entry and have
a low potential for microbe inoculation.

Work-Up
1. History: Determine the nature of the injury
and the foreign body. Must have a high index

3. CT scan of the orbit and brain (axial and
coronal views, with no larger than 1-mm
sections of the orbit) is always the initial
study of choice regardless of foreign body
material to rule out a possible metallic foreign body. CT may miss certain materials
(e.g., wood may look like air). If wood or
vegetative matter is suspected, it is helpful to let the radiologist know in advance.
Any lucency within the orbit can then be
measured in Hounsfield units to differentiate wood from air. MRI is never the initial
study and is contraindicated if a metal foreign body is suspected or cannot be excluded, but may be a helpful adjunct to CT once
metallic foreign bodies are ruled out.

3

4. Based on imaging studies, determine the
location of the intraorbital foreign body,
and rule out optic nerve or central nervous
system involvement (frontal lobe, cavernous sinus, carotid artery).
5. Conduct orbital B-scan if a foreign body
is suspected, but not detected, by CT scan.
B-scan is only helpful in the anterior
orbit.
6. Culture any drainage sites or foreign material as appropriate.

Treatment
1. NEVER remove an intraorbital foreign body
at the slit lamp without first obtaining imaging to evaluate the depth and direction
of penetration. Premature removal may result in intracranial bleeding, cerebrospinal
fluid leakage, etc.
2. Surgical exploration, irrigation, and extraction, based on the following indications:

chemosis, a palpable orbital mass, abscess

Trauma

—Any organic or wooden foreign body
(because of the high risk for infection
and sight-threatening complications).
Many copper foreign bodies need to be
removed because of a marked inflammatory reaction.
—Infectious fistula formation.

3

—Signs of optic nerve compression or gazeevoked amaurosis (decreased vision in a
specific gaze).
—A large or sharp-edged foreign body
(independent of composition) that can be
easily extracted.
—Removal of an orbital foreign body
should never be attempted in the setting
of a ruptured globe. The globe must be
repaired first. The orbital foreign body may
be removed as necessary thereafter.
NOTE: Posteriorly located foreign bodies are
often simply observed if inert and not causing
optic nerve compression due to the risk of iatrogenic optic neuropathy or diplopia if surgical
removal is attempted. Alternatively, even an inert and otherwise asymptomatic metallic foreign
body that is anterior and easily accessed may be
removed with relatively low morbidity.

3. Tetanus toxoid as indicated (see Appendix
2, Tetanus Prophylaxis).
4. Consider hospitalization.
—Administer systemic antibiotics promptly
(e.g., cefazolin, 1 g i.v. q8h, for clean, inert
objects). If the object is contaminated or
organic, treat as orbital cellulitis (see 7.3.1,
Orbital Cellulitis).

3.13

—Surgical exploration and removal of the
foreign body when indicated (as above).
Warn the patient and the family preoperatively that it may be impossible to find and
remove the foreign body. Wood is notorious
for splintering on entry, and multiple procedures may be necessary to entirely remove
it. Organic foreign bodies frequently cause
recurrent or smoldering infection within the
orbit, which may require months of antibiotic therapy and additional surgical exploration. This may result in progressive orbital
soft-tissue fibrosis and restrictive strabismus.
—If the decision is made to leave the orbital
foreign body in place, discharge when stable with oral antibiotics (e.g., amoxicillin–
clavulanate 250 to 500 mg p.o. q8h) to
complete a 10- to 14-day course.
5. Patients with small inorganic foreign bodies not requiring surgical intervention may
be discharged without hospitalization with
oral antibiotics for a 10- to 14-day course.

Follow-Up
The patient is told to return within 1 week of
discharge (or immediately if the condition worsens). Close follow-up is indicated for several
weeks after the antibiotic is stopped to assure
that there is no clinical evidence of infection
or migration of the orbital foreign body toward
a critical orbital structure (e.g., the optic nerve,
extraocular muscle, globe). Re-image patient as
clinically necessary. See 3.14, Ruptured Globe and
Penetrating Ocular Injury; 3.11, Traumatic Optic
Neuropathy; and 7.3.1, Orbital Cellulitis.

CORNEAL LACERATION

periphery. Evaluate the depth of the AC
and compare with the fellow eye. A shallow
AC indicates an actively leaking wound or
a self-sealed leak (see Full-Thickness Corneal
Laceration below). A deeper AC in the involved eye can be an indication of a posterior rupture. Check the iris for TIDs and
evaluate the lens for a cataract or a foreign
body tract (must have a high level of suspicion with projectile objects). The presence
of TIDs and lens abnormalities indicate a
ruptured globe. IOP should be measured
only after a ruptured globe is ruled out. Use
applanation only if the laceration site can
be avoided. Otherwise, use a Tono-Pen to
check the IOP.
2. Seidel test (see Appendix 5, Seidel Test to
Detect a Wound Leak). If the Seidel test is
positive, a full-thickness laceration is present (see Full-Thickness Corneal Laceration
below). A negative Seidel test indicates either a partial-thickness laceration or a selfsealed full-thickness laceration.

3. If corneal foreign bodies are present and
superficial, treat per section 3.3, Corneal
and Conjunctival Foreign Bodies. If foreign
bodies are in the deeper cornea, there are
no signs of infection or inflammation, and
are well tolerated (see 3.15, Intraocular Foreign Body, for inert foreign bodies), they
may be left and watched closely. If the patient is symptomatic or signs of infection
or inflammation occur, deeper corneal
foreign bodies should be removed in the
operating room.

4. Tetanus toxoid for dirty wounds (see Appendix 2, Tetanus Prophylaxis).

Follow-Up
Re-evaluate daily until the epithelium heals.

FULL-THICKNESS CORNEAL LACERATION
(See Figure 3.13.2.)
See 3.14, Ruptured Globe and Penetrating Ocular
Injury. Note that small, self-sealing, or slowleaking lacerations may be treated with aqueous suppressants, bandage soft contact lenses,
fluoroquinolone drops q.i.d., and precautions
as listed in 3.14. Alternatively, a pressure patch
and twice-daily antibiotics may be used. Avoid
topical steroids. If an IOFB is present, see 3.15,
Intraocular Foreign Body.

Treatment
1. A cycloplegic (e.g., scopolamine 0.25%)
and an antibiotic (e.g., frequent polymyxin
B/bacitracin ointment or fluoroquinolone
drops, depending on the nature of the
wound).
2. When a moderate to deep corneal laceration is accompanied by wound gape, it is
often best to suture the wound closed in
the operating room to avoid excessive

Pain, decreased vision, loss of fluid from eye.
History of trauma, fall, or sharp object entering globe.

Signs
(See Figure 3.14.1.)
Critical. Full-thickness scleral or corneal laceration, severe subconjunctival hemorrhage
(especially involving 360 degrees of bulbar
conjunctiva, often bullous), a deep or shallow AC compared to the fellow eye, peaked
or irregular pupil, iris TIDs, lens material or
vitreous in the AC, foreign body tract or new
cataract in the lens, or limitation of extraocular motility (greatest in the direction of rupture). Intraocular contents may be outside of
the globe.
Other. Low IOP (although it may be normal
or rarely increased), iridodialysis, cyclodialysis, hyphema, periorbital ecchymosis, vitreous
hemorrhage, dislocated or subluxed lens, and
TON. Commotio retinae, choroidal rupture,
and retinal breaks may be seen but are often
obscured by vitreous hemorrhage.

Work-Up/Treatment
Once the diagnosis of a ruptured globe is made,
further examination should be deferred until

the time of surgical repair in the operating
room. This is to avoid placing any pressure on
the globe and risking extrusion of the intraocular contents. Diagnosis should be made by penlight, indirect ophthalmoscope, or, if possible,
by slit-lamp examination (with very gentle
manipulation). Once the diagnosis is made, the
following measures should be taken:
1. Protect the eye with a shield at all times.
Do not patch the eye.
2. CT scan of the brain and orbits (axial and
coronal views, 1-mm sections) to rule out
IOFB in most cases.
3. Gentle B-scan ultrasound may be needed to localize posterior rupture site(s) or
to rule out IOFBs not visible on CT scan
(nonmetallic, wood, etc.). However, B-scan
should not be done in patients with an
obvious anterior rupture for the risk of extrusion of intraocular contents. A trained
ophthalmologist should evaluate the patient before B-scan or other manipulation
is performed on a ruptured globe suspect.
4. Admit patient to the hospital with no
food or drink (NPO).
5. Place patient on bed rest with bathroom
privileges. Avoid bending over and Valsalva maneuvers.
6. Systemic antibiotics should be administered within 6 hours of injury. For adults,
give cefazolin 1 g i.v. q8h or vancomycin
1 g i.v. q12h. Also give ciprofloxacin 400
mg p.o. or i.v. b.i.d. (fourth-generation
fluoroquinolones, such as gatifloxacin
400 mg q.d. or moxifloxacin 400 mg q.d.
may have better vitreous penetration).
For children ≤12 years, give cefazolin 25
to 50 mg/kg/ day i.v. in three divided doses, and gentamicin 2 mg/kg i.v. q8h.

NOTE: In any severely traumatized eye in
which there is no chance of restoring vision,
enucleation should be considered initially or
within 7 to 14 days after the trauma to prevent the rare occurrence of sympathetic ophthalmia.
Infection is more likely to occur in eyes
with dirty injuries, retained IOFBs, rupture of
lens capsule, and in patients with a long delay
until primary surgical repair. In patients at high
risk of infection, some groups recommend
intravitreal antibiotics (see 12.15, Traumatic

Other. See 3.14, Ruptured Globe and Penetrating Ocular Injury. Also, microcystic (epithelial)
edema of the peripheral cornea (a clue that a
foreign body may be hidden in the AC angle
in the same sector of the eye). Longstanding
iron-containing IOFBs may cause siderosis,
manifesting as anisocoria, heterochromia, corneal endothelial and epithelial deposits, anterior subcapsular cataracts, lens dislocation, and
optic atrophy.

Types of Foreign Bodies
1. Frequently produce severe inflammatory reactions and may encapsulate within 24 hours
if on the retina.
a. Magnetic: Iron, steel, and tin.
b. Nonmagnetic: Copper and vegetable matter (may be severe or mild).

2. Typically produce mild inflammatory reactions.
a. Magnetic: Nickel.
b. Nonmagnetic: Aluminum, mercury,
zinc, vegetable matter (may be severe or
mild).
3. Inert foreign bodies: Carbon, gold, coal, glass,
lead, plaster, platinum, porcelain, rubber, silver, and stone. Brass, an alloy of copper and
zinc, is also relatively nontoxic. However,
even inert foreign bodies can be toxic to the
eye because of a coating or chemical additive. Most BBs and gunshot pellets are made
of 80% to 90% lead and 10% to 20% iron.

Work-Up
1. History: Composition of the foreign body
and the time of last meal.
2. Perform ocular examination, including visual acuity assessment and careful evaluation of whether the globe is intact. If there
is an obvious perforation site, the remainder
of the examination may be deferred until
surgery. If there does not appear to be a risk
of extrusion of the intraocular contents, the
globe is inspected gently to localize the site
of perforation and to detect the foreign body.
a. Slit-lamp examination; search the AC
and iris for a foreign body and look for
an iris TID. Examine the lens for disruption, cataract, or embedded foreign
body. Check the IOP.
b. Consider gonioscopy of the AC angle if
no wound leak can be detected and the
globe appears intact.
c. Dilated retinal examination using indirect ophthalmoscopy.

3. Obtain a CT scan of the orbits and brain
(coronal and axial views with no larger
than 1-mm sections through the orbits).
MRI is contraindicated in the presence of
a metallic foreign body. It may be difficult
to visualize wood, glass, or plastic on a CT
scan, especially acutely.

23/12/11 2:07 AM

4. Gentle B-scan of the globe and orbit. Intraocular air can mimic a foreign body.
UBM to inspect the AC if IOFB not visible
on clinical exam (e.g., foreign body in the
AC angle or sulcus) if needed. These steps
should be deferred in patients with an anterior rupture or suspicion thereof given risk
for extrusion of intraocular contents.
5. Culture the wound site, if it appears infected.
6. Determine whether the foreign body is
magnetic (e.g., examine material from
which the foreign body came).

Treatment
1. Hospitalization with no food or drink
(NPO) until repair.
2. Place a protective shield over the involved
eye. Do not patch the eye.
3. Tetanus prophylaxis as needed (see Appendix 2, Tetanus Prophylaxis).
4. Antibiotics (e.g., vancomycin 1 g i.v. q12h;
and ceftazidime 1 g i.v. q12h or ciprofloxacin
400 mg i.v. q12 hr or moxifloxacin 400 mg
i.v. q.d. or gatifloxacin 400 mg i.v. q.d.).
NOTE: Fluoroquinolones are contraindicated in
children and pregnant women.

5. Cycloplegic (e.g., atropine 1% t.i.d.) for
posterior-segment foreign bodies.
6. Urgent surgical removal of any acute IOFB
is advisable to reduce the risk of infection.
For some metallic foreign bodies, a magnet
may be useful during surgical extraction.
Copper or contaminated foreign bodies require especially urgent removal. A chronic
IOFB may require removal if associated
with severe recurrent inflammation, if in
the visual axis, or if causing siderosis.

3

7. If endophthalmitis is present, treat as per
12.15, Traumatic Endophthalmitis.

Follow-Up
Observe the patient closely in the hospital
for signs of inflammation or infection. If the
surgeon is uncertain as to whether the foreign
body was entirely removed, postoperative
imaging should be considered with B-scan or
UBM as above. Periodic follow-up for years is
required; watch for a delayed inflammatory
reaction. When an IOFB is left in place, an
electroretinogram (ERG) should be obtained
as soon as it can be done safely. Serial ERGs
should be followed to look for a toxic retinopathy, which will often reverse if the foreign
body is removed.

COMMOTIO RETINAE

Symptoms
Decreased vision or asymptomatic; history of
recent ocular trauma.

Signs
(See Figure 3.16.1.)
Confluent area of retinal whitening. When
occurring in the posterior pole is called Berlin’s
edema. The retinal blood vessels are undisturbed in the area of retinal whitening. However, other signs of ocular trauma may be noted
including retinal hemorrhages.
NOTE: Visual acuity does not always correlate with
the degree of retinal whitening.

lows trauma. Whitening of the retina along
the distribution of an artery. See 11.7,
Branch Retinal Artery Occlusion.
 White without pressure: Common benign

peripheral retinal finding. May be associated with a prominent vitreous base.

3.17

Follow-Up
Dilated fundus examination is repeated in 1
to 2 weeks. Patients are instructed to return
sooner if retinal detachment symptoms are
experienced (see 11.3, Retinal Detachment).

TRAUMATIC CHOROIDAL RUPTURE

Symptoms
Decreased vision or asymptomatic; history of
ocular trauma.

Signs
(See Figure 3.17.1.)

Critical. A yellow or white crescent-shaped
subretinal streak, usually concentric to the
optic disc. It may be single or multiple. Often
the rupture cannot be seen until several days
or weeks after trauma because it may be
obscured by overlying blood.
Other. Rarely, the rupture may be radially oriented. Choroidal neovascularization (CNV) may develop later. TON may be
present.

Differential Diagnosis
 Lacquer cracks of high myopia: Often bilat-

eral. A tilted disc, a scleral crescent adjacent
to the disc, and a posterior staphyloma may
also be seen. CNV also may develop in this
condition. See 11.22, High Myopia.
 Angioid streaks: Bilateral subretinal streaks

Chorioretinitis Sclopetaria

51

Work-Up

Follow-Up

1. Complete ocular examination, including
dilated fundus evaluation to rule out retinal
breaks and to detect CNV which is best seen
using slit-lamp biomicroscopy with either a
fundus contact or 60- or 90-diopter lens.

After ocular trauma, patients with hemorrhage obscuring the underlying choroid are
re-evaluated every 1 to 2 weeks until the choroid can be well visualized. If a choroidal rupture is present, patients are instructed in the
use of an Amsler grid and told to return if a
change in the appearance of the grid is noted
(see Appendix 4, Amsler Grid). Although CNV
is rare overall, ruptures that are particularly
long or closer to the fovea are at greater risk
for development of CNV. Fundus examinations may be performed every 6 to 12 months
depending on the severity and risk of progression to CNV. Patients treated for CNV must be
followed closely after treatment to watch for
persistent or new CNV (see 11.17, Neovascular
or Exudative (Wet) Age-Related Macular Degeneration, for further follow-up guidelines).

2. Consider fluorescein angiography to confirm the presence and location of CNV.

Treatment
Intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth
factor (VEGF) drugs are the treatment of
choice for all types of CNV. Surgical removal
of the CNV, laser photocoagulation, or photodynamic therapy may be considered depending on location of CNV. See 11.17, Neovascular
or Exudative (Wet) Age-Related Macular Degeneration, for more information on CNV treatment.

CHORIORETINITIS SCLOPETARIA

Symptoms
Visual loss, severity depends on region of
involvement, history of high-velocity missile
injury to orbit (e.g., a BB, bullet, or shrapnel).

Signs
(See Figure 3.18.1.)

Critical. Areas of choroidal and retinal rupture and necrosis leaving bare sclera on fundus examination; subretinal, intraretinal,
preretinal, and vitreous hemorrhage often
involving the macula. Eventually blood is
resorbed and the resultant defects are replaced
by fibrous tissue.
Other. Intraorbital foreign body, “claw-like”
break in the Bruch membrane and choriocapillaris. Can have associated avulsion of vitreous
base which can cause peripheral retinal dialysis.

Etiology
Caused by a high-velocity missile passing
through the orbit without directly contacting the globe. Shock waves produced by the
missile’s passage through the orbit lead to the
chorioretinal injury.

Differential Diagnosis

 Choroidal rupture: White or yellow crescent-

shaped subretinal streak usually concentric
to the optic nerve. No retinal break is present. Initially retinal hemorrhage in the posterior pole may obscure a choroidal rupture
which then becomes apparent only over the
following several weeks as the blood clears.
See 3.17, Traumatic Choroidal Rupture.
 Optic nerve avulsion: Decreased vision

with RAPD on examination and hemorrhagic depression or excavation of the optic
disc if partial or retraction of entire nerve
if complete. Often associated with vitreous
hemorrhage. No treatment is available and
visual prognosis depends on extent of injury. See 3.11, Traumatic Optic Neuropathy.

Work-Up

3. Protect the eye with a shield.
4. CT of the orbits (axial and coronal) to
check for intrascleral, intraocular, or intraorbital foreign bodies. B-scan or UBM may
be helpful to rule out intraocular or intraorbital foreign bodies.

Treatment
There is no effective treatment, and typically patients are observed. Complications,
including retinal dialysis and retinal detachment, are treated appropriately. Surgery can
also be considered for nonclearing vitreous
hemorrhage (VH).

Follow-Up

1. History: Known injury with a projectile?
2. Complete ocular evaluation including dilated retinal examination. Look for areas
of retinal and choroidal rupture with underlying bare sclera. Carefully examine the

3.19

conjunctiva and anterior sclera ruling out
ruptured globe. Rule out IOFB. Carefully examine the retinal periphery for retinal tears
or dialysis especially if the vitreous base has
avulsed.

Sequential examinations are required every 2
to 4 weeks looking for signs of retinal detachment as blood clears. Patients should be followed until an atrophic scar replaces areas of
hemorrhage.

PURTSCHER RETINOPATHY

Symptoms

Differential Diagnosis

Decreased vision, often sudden, can be severe.
There may be a history of compression injury
to the chest, head, or lower extremities, but
not a direct ocular injury.

 Pseudo-Purtscher retinopathy: Several enti-

ties with the same or similar presentation that

Signs

Critical. Multiple cotton wool spots and/
or superficial hemorrhages in a configuration

are typically bilateral but may be asymmetric
or unilateral.
Other. Serous macular detachment; dilated
tortuous vessels; hard exudates; optic disc
edema, though the disc usually appears normal; RAPD; optic atrophy when chronic.

are not associated with trauma (Purtscher
retinopathy by definition occurs with
trauma). Causes include acute pancreatitis,
malignant hypertension, collagen vascular
diseases (e.g., systemic lupus erythematosis, scleroderma, dermatomyositis, Sjögren
syndrome), thrombotic thrombocytopenic
purpura (TTP), chronic renal failure, amniotic fluid embolism, retrobulbar anesthesia,
orbital steroid injection, alcohol use, and
long bone fractures.
 Central retinal vein occlusion: Unilateral,

multiple hemorrhages and cotton wool spots
diffusely throughout the retina. See 11.8,
Central Retinal Vein Occlusion.
 Central retinal artery occlusion: Unilateral

retinal whitening with a cherry-red spot,
see 11.6, Central Retinal Artery Occlusion.

Etiology
Not well understood. It is felt that the findings are due to occlusion of small arterioles in
the peripapillary retina by different particles
depending on the associated systemic condition: complement activation, fibrin clots,
platelet–leukocyte aggregates, or fat emboli.

Work-Up
1. History: Determine if there is a history of
compression injury to the head or chest. If
not, then inquire as to symptoms associated

3.20

with causes of pseudo-Purtscher (see above
e.g., renal failure, rheumatologic disease).
2. Complete ocular examination including
dilated retinal evaluation. Rule out direct
globe injury.
3. If the characteristic findings occur in association with severe head or chest trauma,
then the diagnosis is established and no
further work-up is required. However, if
not, then the patient needs a systemic
work-up to investigate other causes (e.g.,
basic metabolic panel, amylase, lipase,
complete blood count, blood pressure measurement, rheumatologic evaluation).

3

4. CT of the head, chest, or long bones as indicated.
5. Fluorescein angiography: Shows patchy
capillary nonperfusion in regions of retinal
whitening.

Treatment
No ocular treatment available. Must treat the
underlying condition if possible to prevent
further damage.

Follow-Up
Repeat dilated fundus examination in 2 to
4 weeks. Retinal lesions resolve over a few weeks
to months. Visual acuity may remain reduced,
but may return to baseline in 50% of cases.

SHAKEN BABY SYNDROME/INFLICTED
CHILDHOOD NEUROTRAUMA

Definition
Syndrome of intracranial hemorrhage, skeletal
fractures and/or multilayered retinal hemorrhages thought due to the acceleration–deceleration forces of violent shaking. May be
associated with other injuries (e.g., long bone
or rib fractures). External signs of trauma are
frequently absent.

Symptoms
Change in mental status, new onset seizures,
poor feeding, irritability, inability to track
or follow with eyes. Child is usually <1 year

LWBK1000-C03_p13-54.indd 53

53

old and rarely >3 years of age. Symptoms and
signs often inconsistent with history.

Signs
Critical. Multilayered (pre-, intra-, and subretinal) retinal hemorrhages are present in
∼80%. Markedly asymmetric hemorrhages
in up to 20% of cases, unilateral in approximately 2% of cases. Hemorrhages can be few
in number, exclusively intraretinal, and confined to the posterior pole. In approximately
two-thirds of the cases, the hemorrhages are
too numerous to count and extend to the ora

serrata. Macular retinoschisis (hemorrhagic
macular cysts) may be seen. Most commonly
associated brain lesions are subarachnoid and
subdural hemorrhages.

3

Other. Subretinal and vitreous hemorrhage
less common. Retinal detachment, papilledema, late optic atrophy, optic nerve avulsion, optic nerve sheath hemorrhage, avulsion
fractures, periosteal reactions in long bones as
well as many signs of acute and old trauma
can be seen.

Differential Diagnosis
 Severe accidental injury: Accompanied by

other external injuries consistent with the
history. Even in the most severe accidental
injuries, retinal hemorrhages are rare. If
present, they are typically mild and do not
extend to the ora serrata.
 Birth trauma: Retinal hemorrhages can be

extensive but typically resolve within 4 to
6 weeks. Clinical history must be consistent. Most common cause of mild retinal
hemorrhage in neonates.
 Coagulopathies, leukemia, and other blood

dyscrasias. Rare, but should be ruled out.
May be source of extensive retinal hemorrhages.
 Terson syndrome: Intraocular hemorrhage

due to intracranial hemorrhage and elevated intracranial pressure. Subhyaloid
hemorrhage is classic, but can be in any
level (i.e., sub-, intra-, or preretinal, or vitreous hemorrhage). Most often after subarachnoid hemorrhage due to ruptured
cerebral aneurysms. Rarely, if ever, occurs
in children.

2. Check vitals and obtain systemic evaluation by a pediatrician.
3. Complete ophthalmic examination, including pupils and dilated fundus examination.
4. Laboratory: Complete blood count, platelet count, PT/INR, and PTT. Consider additional evaluation including fibrinogen,
D-dimer, factor levels, von Willebrand factor, as well as other tests based on initial
screening results.
5. Obtain appropriate imaging: CT or MRI, as
well as a bone scan.
6. Admit patient to the hospital if shaken
baby syndrome is suspected. Requires coordinated care by neurosurgery, pediatrics,
psychiatry, and social services.
NOTE: Careful documentation is an integral part
of the evaluation as the medical record may be
used as a legal document. Ocular photography is
perhaps the gold standard for documenting retinal hemorrhages, although fundus photography
can be difficult to obtain and is not universally
available.

Treatment
Predominantly supportive. Focus is on systemic complications. Ocular manifestations
are usually observed. In cases of dense vitreous
hemorrhage, vitrectomy may be considered
due to the risk of amblyopia and high myopia.

NOTE: All physicians are legally mandated to report
suspected child abuse. There is legal precedence for
prosecution of non-reporters.

 Severe hypertension: Peripapillary retinal

hemorrhages are most common. See 11.10,
Hypertensive Retinopathy.

Work-Up
1. Obtain a thorough history from caregiver(s),
separately if possible. Be alert for history incompatible with injuries or changing versions of history.

LWBK1000-C03_p13-54.indd 54

Follow-Up
Prognosis is variable and unpredictable.
Approximately a 30% mortality rate. Survivors
can suffer from significant cognitive disabilities, and severe visual loss occurs in 20% of
children, usually from optic atrophy or brain
injury.

SUPERFICIAL PUNCTATE KERATOPATHY

Symptoms
Pain, photophobia, red eye, foreign body sensation, mildly decreased vision.

Signs
(See Figure 4.1.1.)
Critical. Pinpoint corneal epithelial defects
that stain with fluorescein. May be confluent
if severe. Staining pattern may allude to etiology. Pain is relieved by the instillation of anesthetic drops.
NOTE: Relief of pain with the instillation of anesthetic drops (e.g., proparacaine) strongly suggests
corneal epithelial disease as the etiology of pain.
Although anesthetic drop instillation is an essential part of the ocular examination, patients should
NEVER be prescribed topical anesthetic drops and
the clinician should ensure the patient does not take
anesthetic drops from the office. When used chronically, these drops inhibit epithelial healing and may
cause ring corneal ulcers.

injection, eyelids stuck together on awakening. See 5.1, Acute Conjunctivitis, and 5.2,
Chronic Conjunctivitis.
—Trichiasis/distichiasis: One or more eyelashes rubbing against the cornea (superior
SPK if misdirected lashes from upper eyelid). See 6.5, Trichiasis.

NOTE: Presence of underlying inflammation and
infiltrates indicates punctate epithelial keratitis,
which appears as granular opalescent devitalized
epithelial cells that stain relatively poorly with
fluorescein. May stain with rose bengal. May
indicate a viral etiology.

Work-Up
1. History: Trauma? Contact lens wear?
Eye drops? Discharge or eyelid matting?
Chemical or ultraviolet light exposure?
Time of day when worse? Snoring or sleep
apnea?
2. Evaluate the cornea, eyelid margin, and tear
film with fluorescein. Evert the upper and
lower eyelids. Check eyelid closure, position, and laxity. Look for inward-growing
lashes.
3. Inspect contact lenses for fit (if still in the
eye) and for the presence of deposits, sharp
edges, and cracks.
NOTE: A soft contact lens should be removed
before placing fluorescein in the eye.

Treatment
See the appropriate section to treat the underlying disorder. SPK is often treated nonspecifically as follows:
1. Noncontact lens wearer with a small
amount of SPK
—Artificial tears q.i.d., preferably preservative free.
—Can add a lubricating ointment q.h.s.
2. Noncontact lens wearer with a large
amount of SPK
—Preservative-free artificial tears q2h.
—Antibiotic (e.g., bacitracin/polymyxin B
or erythromycin ointment q.i.d. for 3 to
5 days).
—Consider a cycloplegic drop (e.g., cyclopentolate 1% to 2% t.i.d., or scopolamine
0.25% b.i.d.) for relief of pain and photophobia.

3. Contact lens wearer with a small amount of
SPK
—Discontinue contact lens wear.
—Artificial tears four to six times per day,
preferably preservative free.
—Can add a lubricating ointment q.h.s.
4. Contact lens wearer with a large amount of
SPK
—Discontinue contact lens wear.
—Antibiotic: Fluoroquinolone (e.g., gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin, or besifloxacin) or
tobramycin drops four to six times per day,
and tobramycin, ciprofloxacin, or bacitracin/polymyxin B ointment q.h.s. If confluent SPK, consider bacitracin/polymyxin B,
ciprofloxacin, or tobramycin ointment four
to six times per day.
—Consider a cycloplegic drop (e.g., cyclopentolate 1% to 2% t.i.d.) for relief of pain
and photophobia.

NOTE: DO NOT patch contact lens-related SPK
or epithelial defects because they can quickly
develop into severe infectious ulcers.

Recurrent Corneal Erosion

57

Follow-Up
1. Non-contact lens wearers with SPK are not
seen again solely for the SPK unless the
patient is a child or is unreliable. Reliable
patients are told to return if their symptoms worsen or do not improve within
2 to 3 days. When underlying ocular disease is responsible for the SPK, follow-up is
in accordance with the guidelines for the
underlying problem.
2. Contact lens wearers with a large amount
of SPK are seen daily until significant
improvement is demonstrated. Contact
lenses are not to be worn until the condition clears. Antibiotics may be discontinued when the SPK resolves. The patient’s
contact lens regimen (e.g., wearing time,
cleaning routine) must be corrected or the
contact lenses changed if either is thought
to be responsible (see 4.21, Contact LensRelated Problems). Contact lens wearers with
a small amount of SPK are rechecked in
several days to 1 week, depending on their
symptoms and degree of SPK.

4

NOTE: Contact lens wearers should be told not
to wear their lenses when their eyes feel irritated.

RECURRENT CORNEAL EROSION

Symptoms
Recurrent attacks of acute ocular pain, photophobia, foreign body sensation, and tearing. Typically occur at the time of awakening,
when the eyelids are rubbed or opened. There
is often a history of prior corneal abrasion
in the involved eye. The unpredictability of
recurrent erosions may cause patients intense
anxiety.

Signs
Critical. Localized roughening of the corneal epithelium (fluorescein dye may lightly
outline the area) or a corneal abrasion. Epithelial changes may resolve within hours of the
onset of symptoms so that an abnormality is

difficult to detect or absent when the patient
is examined.
Other. Corneal epithelial dots or small cysts
(microcysts), a fingerprint pattern, or maplike
lines may be seen in both eyes if epithelial
basement membrane (map–dot–fingerprint)
dystrophy is present.

Etiology
Damage to the corneal epithelium or epithelial basement membrane from one of the following:
 Anterior corneal dystrophy: e.g., epi-

thelial basement membrane (most common), Reis–Bücklers, and Meesmann

tipped applicator or cellulose sponge to
gently remove the loose epithelium.
5. For erosions not responsive to the preceding treatment, consider the following:
—Prophylactic medical treatment with 5%
sodium chloride ointment q.h.s. or oral
doxycycline (matrix metalloproteinase
inhibitor) 50 mg b.i.d. with or without a
short course of topical corticosteroid drops
(e.g., fluorometholone 0.1% b.i.d. to q.i.d.
for 2 to 4 weeks).
—Extended-wear bandage soft contact lens
for several months with a topical antibiotic
until epithelial adhesion is obtained.
—Anterior stromal puncture can be applied
to localized erosions, often after trauma,
outside the visual axis in cooperative
patients. It can be performed with or without an intact epithelium. Stromal puncture
may be applied manually at the slit lamp
or more recently with a Nd:YAG laser. This
treatment may cause small permanent corneal scars that are usually of no visual significance.
—Epithelial debridement with diamond
burr polishing of Bowman membrane.
Effective for large areas of epithelial irregularity and lesions in the visual axis.
—Phototherapeutic keratectomy (PTK):
Excimer laser ablation of the superficial
stroma is successful in up to 90% of patients
with recurrent erosions. Diamond burr polishing is at least as effective.

3. After epithelial healing is complete, artificial tears four to eight times per day and
artificial tear ointment q.h.s. for at least 3
to 6 months, or 5% sodium chloride drops

Dry-Eye Syndrome

59

DRY-EYE SYNDROME

Symptoms
Burning, dryness, foreign body sensation,
mildly to moderately decreased vision, excess
tearing. Often exacerbated by smoke, wind,
heat, low humidity, or prolonged use of the eye
(commonly when working on a computer).
May worsen later in the day. Usually bilateral
and chronic (although patients sometimes are
seen with recent onset in one eye). Discomfort
often out of proportion to clinical signs.

—Combination: Often an inner mucin
layer tear deficiency.
 Lifestyle related: Arid climate, allergen expo-

sure, smoking, extended periods of reading/
computer work/television viewing.
 Connective tissue diseases: e.g., Sjögren

syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, Wegener
granulomatosis, systemic lupus erythematosus.

linergics, antihistamines, antiarrhythmics,
antipsychotics, antispasmotics, tricyclic
antidepressants, beta blockers, diuretics, retinoids, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, chemotherapy.

 Decreased tear break-up time (measured

from a blink to the appearance of a tear film
defect, by using fluorescein stain): Less than
10 seconds indicates tear film instability.
NOTE: Tear film defects must be randomly located,
as isolated areas of repeated early tear break-up
may indicate a focal corneal surface irregularity.

Other. Punctate corneal or conjunctival fluorescein, rose bengal, or lissamine green staining; usually inferiorly or in the interpalpebral
area. Excess mucus or debris in the tear film
and filaments on the cornea may be found in
severe cases.

Differential Diagnosis
See 4.1, Superficial Punctate Keratopathy.

Etiology
 Idiopathic: Commonly found in meno-

pausal and postmenopausal women.
—Evaporative: Outer lipid layer tear deficiency; often associated with blepharitis or
meibomian gland dystrophy.
—Hyposecretory: Middle aqueous layer tear
deficiency; production decrease with age.

LWBK1000-C04_p55-109.indd 59

 Infiltration of the lacrimal glands: e.g.,

sarcoidosis, tumor.
 Post-radiation fibrosis of the lacrimal glands.
 Vitamin A deficiency: Usually from malnu-

trition, intestinal malabsorption, or bariatric surgery. See 13.7, Vitamin A Deficiency.
 After laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK):

Likely secondary to disruption of corneal
nerves and interference with normal reflex
tearing.

Work-Up
1. History and external examination to detect
underlying etiology.
2. Slit-lamp examination with fluorescein
stain to examine the tear meniscus and tear
break-up time. May also use rose bengal or
lissamine green stain to examine the cornea and conjunctiva.
3. Schirmer test. Technique: After drying the
eye of excess tears, Schirmer filter paper is
placed at the junction of the middle and
lateral one-third of the lower eyelid in each
eye for 5 minutes. Eyes are to remain open
with normal blinking.

Cornea

—Unanesthetized: Measures basal and
reflex tearing. Normal is wetting of at least
15 mm in 5 minutes.
—Anesthetized: Topical anesthetic (e.g.,
proparacaine) is applied before drying the
eye and placing the filter paper. Measures
basal tearing only. Abnormal is wetting of
5 mm or less in 5 minutes. Less than 10 mm
may be considered borderline. We prefer
the less irritating anesthetized method.

4

Treatment
Mild Dry Eye
Artificial tears q.i.d.
Moderate Dry Eye
1. Increase the frequency of artificial tear
application up to q1–2h; use unit dose preservative-free artificial tears.

3. Add lubricating ointment or gel b.i.d. to
q.i.d., p.r.n.
4. Moisture chamber (plastic film sealed at
orbital rim) or goggles with lubrication
at night.
5. If mucus strands or filaments are present,
remove with forceps and consider 10% acetylcysteine q.i.d.
6. Other therapies may include oral flaxseed
oil, oral omega-3 fatty acids, autologous
serum tears, topical vitamin A, bandage
contact lens, or a scleral lens.
7. Consider a permanent lateral tarsorrhaphy if
all of the previous measures fail. A temporary
adhesive tape tarsorrhaphy (to tape the lateral one-third of the eyelid closed) can also
be used, pending a surgical tarsorrhaphy.

2. Add a lubricating ointment or gel q.h.s.

NOTE:

3. Lifestyle modification (e.g., humidifiers
and smoking cessation).

1. In addition to treating the dry eye, treatment
for contributing disorders (e.g., blepharitis,
exposure keratopathy) should be instituted if
these conditions are present.

4. Cyclosporine 0.05% b.i.d. is effective for
patients with chronic dry eye and decreased
tears secondary to ocular inflammation.
Cyclosporine often burns with application
for the first several weeks and takes 1 to
3 months for significant clinical improvement. To hasten improvement and lessen
side effects, consider treating patients concomitantly with a mild topical corticosteroid
drop (e.g., loteprednol 0.5%) b.i.d. to q.i.d.
for 1 month while beginning cyclosporine
therapy.
5. If these measures are inadequate or impractical, consider punctal occlusion. Use
collagen inserts (temporary) or silicone
or acrylic plugs (reversible). Be sure any
inflammatory
component
including
blepharitis is treated prior to punctal
occlusion.
Severe Dry Eye
1. Cyclosporine 0.05%, as described earlier.
2. Punctal occlusion, as described earlier (both
lower and upper puncta if necessary), and
preservative-free artificial tears up to q1–2h
as needed. Consider permanent occlusion
by thermal cautery if plugs fall out.

LWBK1000-C04_p55-109.indd 60

2. Always use preservative-free artificial tears if
dosing is more frequent than q.i.d. to prevent preservative toxicity.
3. If the history suggests the presence of a connective tissue disease (e.g., history of arthritic pain,
dry mouth), referral should be made to an internist or rheumatologist for further evaluation.

Follow-Up
In days to months, depending on the severity
of the drying changes and the symptoms. Anyone with severe dry eyes caused by an underlying chronic systemic disease (e.g., rheumatoid
arthritis, sarcoidosis, ocular pemphigoid) may
need to be monitored more closely.
NOTE: Patients with significant dry eye should be
discouraged from contact lens wear and LASIK surgery. However, daily disposable contact lenses can
be successful if fit loosely and combined with cyclosporine 0.05% and plugs, if needed.
Patients with Sjögren syndrome have an increased
incidence of lymphoma and mucous membrane
problems and may require internal medicine, rheumatologic, dental, and gynecologic follow-up.

Filamentary Keratopathy

61

FILAMENTARY KERATOPATHY

Symptoms
Moderate-to-severe pain, red eye, foreign body
sensation, photophobia.

2. Slit-lamp examination with fluorescein
staining.

Treatment

Signs

1. Treat the underlying condition.

Critical. Short fluorescein-staining strands
of epithelial cells and mucus attached to the
anterior surface of the cornea at one end of
the strand.

2. Consider debridement of the filaments.
After applying topical anesthesia (e.g., proparacaine), gently remove filaments at their
base with fine forceps or a cotton-tipped
applicator. This gives temporary relief, but
the filaments will recur if the underlying
etiology is not treated.

Other. Conjunctival injection, poor tear
film, punctate epithelial defects.

Etiology
 Dry-eye syndrome: Most common cause.

See 4.3, Dry-Eye Syndrome.
 Superior limbic keratoconjunctivitis: Fila-

ments are located in the superior cornea,
in association with superior conjunctival
injection and fluorescein staining, and with
superior corneal pannus. See 5.4, Superior
Limbic Keratoconjunctivitis.
 Recurrent corneal erosions: Recurrent spon-

taneous corneal abrasions often occurring
upon awakening. See 4.2, Recurrent Corneal
Erosion.
 Adjacent to irregular corneal surface (e.g.,

postoperative, near a surgical wound).
 Patching: e.g., postoperative, after corneal

abrasions.
 Neurotrophic keratopathy: See 4.6, Neuro-

trophic Keratopathy.
 Chronic bullous keratopathy: See 4.28,

Aphakic Bullous Keratopathy/Pseudophakic
Bullous Keratopathy.

Work-Up
1. History, especially for the previously mentioned conditions.

LWBK1000-C04_p55-109.indd 61

3. Lubrication with one of the following regimens:
—Preservative-free artificial tears six to
eight times per day and lubricating ointment q.h.s.
—Punctal occlusion.
—Acetylcysteine 10% q.i.d.
NOTE: Acetylcysteine is not commercially available as a drop but can be made by a compounding pharmacy.

4. If the symptoms are severe or treatment
fails, then consider a bandage soft contact
lens (unless the patient has severe dry eyes).
Extended-wear bandage soft contact lenses
may need to be worn for weeks to months.
Consider concomitant topical antibiotic
use.

Follow-Up
In 1 to 4 weeks, if the condition is not
improved, consider repeating the filament
removal or applying a bandage soft contact
lens. Long-term lubrication must be maintained if the underlying condition cannot be
eliminated.

EXPOSURE KERATOPATHY

Symptoms

4

 After ptosis repair or blepharoplasty pro-

cedures.

Ocular irritation, burning, foreign body sensation, and redness of one or both eyes. Usually
worse in the morning.

 Floppy eyelid syndrome: See 6.6, Floppy

Signs

 Poor blink from Parkinson disease.

Critical. Inadequate blinking or closure of
the eyelids, leading to corneal drying. Punctate epithelial defects are found in the lower
one-third of the cornea or as a horizontal
band in the region of the palpebral fissure (see
Figure 4.5.1).
Other. Conjunctival injection and chemosis, corneal erosion, infiltrate or ulcer, eyelid
deformity, or abnormal eyelid closure.

Etiology
 Seventh

nerve palsy: Orbicularis oculi
weakness (e.g., Bell palsy). See 10.9, Isolated
Seventh Nerve Palsy.

 Sedation or altered mental status.
 Eyelid deformity: e.g., ectropion or eyelid

scarring from trauma, chemical burn, or
herpes zoster ophthalmicus (HZO).
 Nocturnal lagophthalmos: Failure to close

the eyes during sleep.

Eyelid Syndrome.

Work-Up
1. History: Previous Bell palsy or eyelid surgery? Thyroid disease?
2. Evaluate eyelid closure and corneal exposure.
Ask the patient to close his or her eyes gently
(as if sleeping). Assess Bell phenomenon (the
patient is asked to close the eyelids forcefully
against resistance; abnormal when the eyes
do not rotate upward). Check for eyelid laxity.
3. Check corneal sensation before instillation of anesthetic drops. If sensation is
decreased, there is greater risk for corneal
complications.
4. Slit-lamp examination: Evaluate the tear
film and corneal integrity with fluorescein
dye. Look for signs of secondary infection
(e.g., corneal infiltrate, anterior chamber
reaction, severe conjunctival injection).
5. Investigate any underlying disorder (e.g.,
etiology of seventh nerve palsy).

 Proptosis: e.g., due to an orbital process,

such as thyroid eye disease. See 7.1, Orbital
Disease.

Treatment
Prevention is critical. All patients who are
sedated or obtunded are at risk for exposure
keratopathy and should receive lubrication as
recommended in the following.
In the presence of secondary corneal infection, see 4.11, Bacterial Keratitis.
1. Correct any underlying disorder.
2. Preservative-free artificial tears q2–6h.
Punctal occlusion with plugs may also be
considered.
3. Lubricating ointment q.h.s. or q.i.d.

FIGURE 4.5.1. Exposure keratopathy with

one-third of the eyelids closed (leaving the
visual axis open) during the day. Taping is
rarely definitive but may be tried when the
underlying disorder is thought to be temporary.
5. When maximal medical therapy fails to
prevent progressive corneal deterioration,
one of the following surgical procedures
may be beneficial:

the preceding fail).

Follow-Up
Reevaluate every 1 to 2 days in the presence
of corneal ulceration. Less frequent examinations (e.g., in weeks to months) are required
for less severe corneal disease.

 Diabetic neuropathy.

Signs

 Extensive panretinal photocoagulation: may

Critical. Loss of corneal sensation, epithelial
defects with fluorescein staining.
Other.
 Early: Perilimbal injection progressing to
corneal punctate epithelial defects or a frank
nonhealing epithelial defect with rolled
edges, stromal edema, and Descemet folds.
 Late: Corneal ulcer with associated iri-

tis. The ulcer often has a gray, heaped-up
epithelial border, tends to be in the lower
one-half of the cornea, and is horizontally
oval. A descemetocele (corneal stromal loss
down to Descemet membrane) or perforation may occur.

Differential Diagnosis
See 4.1, Superficial Punctate Keratopathy.

Etiology
 Postinfection with varicella zoster virus

(VZV) or herpes simplex virus (HSV).

 Topical anesthetic abuse.
 Chronic topical medications (e.g., timolol,

diclofenac, sulfacetamide).
 Crack keratopathy: Often bilateral. Take

careful history for crack cocaine smoking or
potential exposure. Often helpful to admit
patient and remove them from their environment.

Work-Up

2. Prior to anesthesia instillation, test corneal
sensation bilaterally with a sterile cotton
wisp.
3. Slit-lamp examination with fluorescein
staining of cornea and conjunctiva.
4. Check the skin for herpetic lesions or scars
from a previous herpes zoster infection.

5. Look for signs of a corneal exposure problem (e.g., inability to close an eyelid, seventh nerve palsy, absent Bell phenomenon).
6. If suspicious of a central nervous system
lesion, obtain a computed tomography
(CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
of the brain.

Treatment
1. Mild-to-moderate punctate epithelial staining: Preservative-free artificial tears q2–4h
and artificial tear ointment q.h.s. Consider
punctal plugs.
2. Small corneal epithelial defect: Antibiotic
ointment (e.g., erythromycin or bacitracin) four to eight times per day for 3 to
5 days or until resolved. Usually requires
prolonged artificial tear treatment, as
described previously.
3. Corneal ulcer: See 4.11, Bacterial Keratitis, for the work-up and treatment of an
infected ulcer. Antibiotic ointment q2h
without patching may be used. Alterna-

tively, if the ulcer is sterile, apply antibiotic
ointment, cycloplegic drop, and a pressure
patch and re-evaluate in 24 hours. Repeat
procedure daily until healed. Collagenase
inhibitors (e.g., topical acetylcysteine,
oral tetracyclines) may promote re-epithelization. A tarsorrhaphy (eyelids sewn
together), bandage soft contact lens, conjunctival flap, amniotic membrane graft, or
keratoprosthesis may be required. Autologous serum, albumin, or umbilical cord
serum eye drops may also be beneficial.
NOTE: Patients with neurotrophic keratopathy
and corneal exposure often do not respond to
treatment unless a tarsorrhaphy is performed.
A temporary adhesive tape tarsorrhaphy (the
lateral one-third of the eyelid is taped closed)
may be beneficial, pending more definitive
treatment.

Follow-Up
1. Mild-to-moderate epithelial staining: In 3
to 14 days.
2. Corneal epithelial defect: Every 1 to 3 days
until improvement demonstrated, and
then every 5 to 7 days until resolved.
3. Corneal ulcer: Daily until significant
improvement is demonstrated. Hospitalization may be required for severe ulcers (see
4.11, Bacterial Keratitis).

THERMAL/ULTRAVIOLET KERATOPATHY

Symptoms
Moderate-to-severe ocular pain, foreign body
sensation, red eye, tearing, photophobia,
blurred vision; often a history of welding or
using a sunlamp without adequate protective eyewear. Symptoms typically worse 6 to
12 hours after the exposure. Usually bilateral.

Signs
Critical. Confluent
punctate
epithelial
defects in an interpalpebral distribution, seen
with fluorescein staining.

4. Oral analgesics as needed.

Work-Up

Follow-Up

1. History: Welding? Sunlamp use? Topical
medications? Chemical exposure? Prior
episodes?

1. Reliable patients are asked to assess their
own symptoms after 24 hours (if a patch
was placed, it is removed at this time).

2. Slit-lamp examination: Use fluorescein
stain. Evert the eyelids to search for a foreign body.

2. If much improved, the patient continues
with topical antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin
or bacitracin ointment q.i.d.).

3. If chemical exposure suspected, check pH
of tear lake in lower conjunctival fornix. If
not neutral (6.8 to 7.5), treat as chemical
burn. See 3.1, Chemical Burn.

3. If still significantly symptomatic, the
patient should return for re-evaluation. If
significant punctate staining is still present,
the patient is retreated with a cycloplegic,
antibiotic, and possible pressure patch, as
discussed previously.

especially in patients with side effects from
steroids.

Follow-Up
Weekly during an exacerbation, then every
3 to 6 months. Patients receiving topical steroids require intraocular pressure (IOP) checks
every 4 to 12 weeks.

PTERYGIUM/PINGUECULA

Symptoms
Irritation, redness, decreased vision; may be
asymptomatic.

Signs
Critical. One of the following, almost
always located at the 3- or 9-o’clock position
at the limbus.
 Pterygium: Wing-shaped fold of fibrovas-

cular tissue arising from the interpalpebral
conjunctiva and extending onto the cornea.
Usually nasal in location (see Figure 4.9.1).
 Pinguecula: Yellow-white, flat or slightly

raised conjunctival lesion, usually in the
interpalpebral fissure adjacent to the limbus, but not involving the cornea.
Other. Either lesion may be highly vascularized and injected or may be associated with
SPK or delle (thinning of the adjacent cornea

secondary to drying). An iron line (Stocker
line) may be seen in the cornea just beyond
the leading edge of a pterygium.

Differential Diagnosis
 Conjunctival intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN):

Unilateral papillomatous jelly-like, velvety,
or leukoplakic (white) mass, often elevated,
vascularized, not in a wing-shaped configuration, not in the typical 3- or 9-o’clock location of a pterygium or pinguecula. See 5.12,
Conjunctival Tumors.
NOTE: Atypical pterygia require biopsy to rule
out CIN or melanoma.

 Limbal

dermoid: Congenital rounded
white lesion, usually at the inferotemporal
limbus. May be a manifestation of Goldenhar syndrome if accompanied by preauricular skin tags or vertebral skeletal defects. See
5.12, Conjunctival Tumors.

 Other conjunctival tumors: e.g., papilloma,

nevus, melanoma; see 5.12, Conjunctival
Tumors.

Conjunctival tissue
adherent to the peripheral cornea. May
appear in location of previous trauma,
corneal ulceration, or cicatrizing conjunctivitis.

trachoma, trauma, and others. Usually at
the level of Bowman membrane with minimal to no elevation.
 Sclerokeratitis: See 5.7, Scleritis.

Etiology
Elastotic degeneration of deep conjunctival layers, related to sunlight exposure and
chronic irritation. More common in individuals from equatorial regions.

Work-Up
Slit-lamp examination to identify the lesion
and evaluate the adjacent corneal integrity
and thickness. Check for corneal astigmatism
in the axis of the pterygium.

5. Surgical removal is indicated when:
—The pterygium progresses toward the
visual axis.
—The patient is experiencing excessive irritation not relieved by the aforementioned
treatment.
—The lesion is interfering with contact lens
wear.
NOTE: Pterygia can recur after surgical excision.
Bare sclera dissection with a conjunctival autograft or amniotic membrane graft reduces the
recurrence rate. Intraoperative application of
an antimetabolite (5-fluorouracil or mitomycinC) also reduces recurrence. Complications are
reduced if no bare sclera remains.

1. Protect eyes from sun, dust, and wind (e.g.,
sunglasses or goggles if appropriate).

Follow-Up

2. Lubrication with artificial tears four to eight
times per day to reduce ocular irritation.

1. Asymptomatic patients may be checked
every 1 to 2 years.

3. For an inflamed pterygium or pinguecula:

2. Pterygia should be measured periodically
(every 3 to 12 months, initially) to determine the rate at which they are growing
toward the visual axis.

—Mild: Artificial tears q.i.d.
—Moderate to severe: A mild topical steroid (e.g., fluorometholone 0.1% q.i.d., or
loteprednol 0.2% to 0.5% q.i.d.). A nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drop (e.g., ketorolac 0.4% to 0.5%) may be used two to four
times per day to decrease symptoms.
4. If a delle is present, then apply artificial tear
ointment q2h. See 4.24, Dellen.

4.10

3. If treating with a topical steroid, check after
a few weeks to monitor inflammation and
IOP. Taper and discontinue the steroid drop
over several weeks once the inflammation
has abated. A nonsteroidal drop may be
used periodically for short times for recurrent inflammation.

BAND KERATOPATHY

Symptoms
Decreased vision, foreign body sensation, corneal whitening; may be asymptomatic.

Signs

it a Swiss cheese appearance. The plaque usually begins at the 3- and 9-o’clock positions,
adjacent to the limbus, and can extend across
the cornea.

Removal of the calcium may be performed at
the slit lamp or under the operating microscope by chelation using disodium ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA):
1. Dilute a solution of 15% EDTA to create a
3% mixture by mixing in a 1.0-mL tuberculin syringe, 0.2 mL of 15% EDTA with
0.8 mL of 0.9% normal saline.

long-standing glaucoma, dry eye, ocular surgery (especially retinal detachment repair
with silicone oil), idiopathic.
Less Common. Hypercalcemia (may result
from hyperparathyroidism, renal failure, sarcoidosis, multiple myeloma, Paget disease of
bone, vitamin D excess, etc.), hyperphosphatemia, gout, corneal dystrophy, myotonic dystrophy, long-term exposure to irritants (e.g.,
mercury fumes), and other causes.

Work-Up
1. History: Chronic eye disease? Previous ocular surgery? Chronic exposure to environmental irritants? Systemic disease?
2. Slit-lamp examination.
3. If no signs of chronic anterior segment disease or long-standing glaucoma are present and the band keratopathy cannot be
accounted for, then consider the following
work-up:
—Serum calcium, albumin, magnesium,
and phosphate levels. Blood urea nitrogen
and creatinine. Uric acid level if gout is suspected.

2. Anesthetize the eye with a topical anesthetic (e.g., proparacaine) and place an eyelid speculum.
3. Debride the corneal epithelium with a sterile scalpel or a sterile cotton-tipped applicator dipped in topical anesthetic or EDTA
solution.
4. Wipe a cellulose sponge or cotton swab saturated with the 3% disodium EDTA solution
over the band keratopathy until the calcium
clears (which may take 10 to 30 minutes).
5. Irrigate with normal saline, place an antibiotic ointment (e.g., erythromycin), a
cycloplegic drop (e.g., cyclopentolate 1% to
2%), and a pressure patch on the eye for
24 hours. (A bandage soft contact lens or an
amniotic membrane may be used to cover
the epithelial defect.)
6. Consider giving the patient an analgesic
(e.g., acetaminophen with codeine).

Follow-Up
1. If surgical removal has been performed,
the patient should be examined every 1 to
2 days with repatching (optional), frequent
antibiotic ointment, and a cycloplegic until
the epithelial defect heals.

Treatment

2. Residual anterior stromal scarring may be
amenable to excimer laser PTK to improve
vision. PTK may also be used to try to
improve the ocular surface and prevent
recurrent erosions.

Mild (e.g., Foreign Body Sensation)
Artificial tears four to six times per day and
artificial tear ointment q.h.s. or q.i.d., p.r.n.
Consider bandage contact lens for comfort.

3. The patient should be checked every
3 to 12 months, depending on the severity of symptoms. Surgical removal can be
repeated if the band keratopathy recurs.

Bacterial Keratitis

BACTERIAL KERATITIS

Symptoms
Red eye, moderate-to-severe ocular pain, photophobia, decreased vision, discharge, acute
contact lens intolerance.

Signs
(See Figure 4.11.1.)
Critical. Focal white opacity (infiltrate) in
the corneal stroma. An ulcer exists if there is
also stromal loss with an overlying epithelial
defect that stains with fluorescein.
NOTE: An examiner using a slit beam cannot see
through an infiltrate or ulcer to the iris, whereas
stromal edema or mild anterior stromal scars are
more transparent.

Other. Epithelial defect, mucopurulent discharge, stromal edema, anterior chamber
reaction with or without hypopyon formation
(which, in the absence of globe perforation,
usually represents sterile inflammation), conjunctival injection, corneal thinning, folds
in Descemet membrane, upper eyelid edema.
Posterior synechiae, hyphema, and increased
IOP may occur in severe cases.

Differential Diagnosis
 Fungal: Must be considered after any trau-

matic corneal injury, particularly from vegetable matter (e.g., a tree branch), which

may lead to filamentous fungal keratitis.
Contact lens wear is another risk factor.
Infiltrates commonly have feathery borders
and may be surrounded by satellite lesions.
Candida infections generally occur in eyes
with pre-existing ocular surface disease and
look like bacterial ulcers. See 4.12, Fungal
Keratitis.
 Acanthamoeba: This protozoan causes an

4

extremely painful epithelial keratitis and/or
stromal infiltrate. It usually occurs in dailywear soft contact lens wearers who may or
may not practice poor lens hygiene, have a
history of swimming while wearing contact
lenses, or a history of trauma. In the early
stages, the slit-lamp appearance typically
looks more like HSV keratitis than a bacterial ulcer. In the late stages (3 to 8 weeks),
the infiltrate often becomes ring shaped.
See 4.13, Acanthamoeba Keratitis.
 HSV: May have eyelid vesicles or corneal

epithelial dendrites. A history of recurrent
unilateral eye disease or known ocular herpes is common. Bacterial superinfections
may develop in patients with chronic herpes simplex keratitis. It is unusual for HSV
to have a staining infiltrate; if present, one
needs to rule out a superinfection. See 4.15,
Herpes Simplex Virus.
 Atypical mycobacteria: Usually follows ocu-

lar injuries with vegetable matter or ocular
surgery, such as cataract extraction, corneal
grafts, and refractive surgery (especially
LASIK). It has a more indolent course. Culture plates (on Lowenstein Jensen media)
must be kept for 8 weeks. An acid-fast bacillus smear is very helpful.
 Sterile corneal thinning and ulcers: Usually

less painful, minimal or no discharge, iritis,
or corneal edema, no infiltrates, and negative cultures. The melting is caused by the
associated disease. See 4.23, Peripheral Corneal Thinning/Ulceration.
 Staphylococcal hypersensitivity: PeriphFIGURE 4.11.1. Bacterial keratitis.

eral corneal infiltrates, sometimes with an

overlying epithelial defect, usually multiple,
often bilateral, with a clear space between
the infiltrate and the limbus. Conjunctival
injection is localized rather than diffuse,
and there is less pain. There is minimalto-no anterior chamber reaction. Often
with coexisting blepharitis. See 4.19, Staphylococcal Hypersensitivity.
 Sterile corneal infiltrates: Typically from an

4

immune reaction to contact lens solutions
or hypoxia. Usually multiple small, often
peripheral, subepithelial infiltrates with an
intact overlying epithelium and minimal
or no anterior chamber reaction. Usually
a diagnosis of exclusion after ruling out an
infectious process. Similar lesions can occur
after adenoviral conjunctivitis, but these are
often more central and more gray. See 5.1,
Acute Conjunctivitis.
 Residual corneal foreign body or rust ring:

History of foreign body injury. May be
accompanied by corneal stromal inflammation, edema, and sometimes, a sterile infiltrate. There may be a mild anterior chamber
reaction. The infiltrate and inflammation
usually clear after the foreign body and rust
ring are removed, but a superinfection may
occur.
 Topical anesthetic abuse: A type of neuro-

trophic ulcer that should be suspected when
there is poor response to appropriate therapy. In the late stages of anesthetic abuse,
the corneal appearance may mimic an
infectious process despite negative cultures.
A large ring opacity, edema, and anterior
chamber reaction are characteristic. Crack
cocaine keratopathy has a similar appearance. Healing, with or without scarring,
typically occurs when the exposure to anesthetic is stopped.

Pseudomonas, Streptococcus, Moraxella, and Serratia species. Clinical findings vary widely
depending on the severity of disease and on
the organism involved. The following clinical
characteristics may be helpful in predicting the
organism involved. However, clinical impression should never take the place of broadspectrum initial treatment and appropriate
laboratory evaluation. See Appendix 8, Corneal
Culture Procedure.
 Staphylococcal ulcers typically have a

well-defined, gray-white stromal infiltrate
that may enlarge to form a dense stromal
abscess.
 Streptococcal infiltrates may be either

very purulent or crystalline (see 4.14,
Crystalline Keratopathy). Severe anterior
chamber reaction and hypopyon formation are common in the former, and the
latter tends to occur in patients on chronic
topical steroids.
 Pseudomonas typically presents as a rapidly

progressive, suppurative, necrotic infiltrate
associated with a hypopyon and mucopurulent discharge in the setting of soft contact lens use (see Figure 4.11.2).
 Moraxella may cause infectious keratitis

in patients with preexisting ocular surface
disease and in patients who are immunocompromised. Infiltrates are typically
indolent, located in the inferior portion of
the cornea, and have a tendency to be fullthickness and may perforate.

Etiology
Bacterial organisms are the most common cause
of infectious keratitis. In general, corneal infections are assumed to be bacterial until proven
otherwise by laboratory studies or until a therapeutic trial of topical antibiotics is unsuccessful.
At the Wills Eye Institute, the most common
causes of bacterial keratitis are Staphylococcus,

Work-Up
1. History: Contact lens wear and care regimen should always be discussed. Sleeping
in contact lenses (this greatly increases
the risk of bacterial keratitis and should be
strongly discouraged)? Daily or extendedwear lenses? Conventional, frequent
replacement, or single use? Disinfecting
solutions used? Recent changes in routine?
Swimming or hot tub use with lenses?
Trauma or corneal foreign body? Corneal
surgery? History of refractive surgery? Eye
care before visit (e.g., antibiotics or topical
steroids)? Previous corneal disease? Systemic illness?

Bacterial Keratitis

71

Low Risk of Visual Loss
Small, nonstaining peripheral infiltrate
with at most minimal anterior chamber
reaction and no discharge:
—Noncontact lens wearer: Broad-spectrum topical antibiotics [e.g., fluoroquinolone (moxifloxacin, gatifloxacin,
besifloxacin, levofloxacin) drops q1–2h].
—Contact lens wearer: Fluoroquinolone
(e.g., gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin, ciprofloxacin, besifloxacin, levofloxacin) drops
q1–2h; can add tobramycin or ciprofloxacin ointment q.h.s. If using ointment
more than q.i.d., use ciprofloxacin ointment.

2. Slit-lamp examination: Stain with fluorescein to determine if there is epithelial
loss overlying the infiltrate; document
the size, depth, and location of the corneal infiltrate and epithelial defect; assess
the anterior chamber reaction and look
for a hypopyon; and measure the IOP by
Tono-Pen.

Borderline Risk of Visual Loss
Medium size (1- to 1.5-mm diameter)
peripheral infiltrate, or any smaller infiltrate with an associated epithelial defect,
mild anterior chamber reaction, or moderate discharge:

3. Corneal scrapings for smears and cultures if
appropriate. We routinely culture infiltrates
larger than 1 to 2 mm, in the visual axis,
unresponsive to initial treatment, or if we
suspect an unusual organism based on history or examination. See Appendix 8, Corneal Culture Procedure.

—Fluoroquinolone (e.g., moxifloxacin,
gatifloxacin, besifloxacin, levofloxacin)
q1h around the clock. Consider starting
with a loading dose of q5 min for five
doses and then q30 min until midnight
then q1h. Moxifloxacin has better Grampositive coverage. Gatifloxacin and ciprofloxacin have better Pseudomonas and
Serratia coverage.

4. In contact lens wearers suspected of having
an infectious ulcer, the contact lenses and
case are cultured, if possible. Explain to the
patient that the cultured contact lenses will
be discarded.

Treatment
Ulcers and infiltrates are initially treated as
bacterial unless there is a high index of suspicion of another form of infection. Initial
therapy needs to be broad spectrum.
1. Cycloplegic drops for comfort and to prevent synechiae formation (e.g., scopolamine 0.25% t.i.d.). Use atropine 1% t.i.d.
when a hypopyon is present.
2. Topical antibiotics according to the following algorithm:

LWBK1000-C04_p55-109.indd 71

4

Vision Threatening
Our current practice at Wills Eye is to
start fortified antibiotics for most ulcers
larger than 1 to 2 mm, in the visual axis,
or unresponsive to initial treatment. See
Appendix 9, Fortified Topical Antibiotics/
Antifungals, for directions on making
fortified antibiotics.
—Fortified tobramycin or gentamicin
(15 mg/mL) q1h, alternating with fortified cefazolin (50 mg/mL) or vancomycin (25 mg/mL) q1h. This means that the
patient will be placing a drop in the eye
every one-half hour around the clock.
Vancomycin drops should be reserved for
resistant organisms, patients at risk for

21/12/11 11:59 PM

72

C H AP T E R

Cornea

resistant organisms (e.g., due to hospital
or antibiotic exposure, unresponsive to
initial treatment), and for patients who
are allergic to penicillin or cephalosporins. An increasing number of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)
infections are now community acquired.
If the ulcer is severe and pseudomonas is
suspected, start fortified tobramycin every
30 minutes and fortified cefazolin q1h; in
addition, consider fortified ceftazidime
q1h.
NOTE: All patients with borderline risk of visual
loss or severe vision-threatening ulcers are initially treated with loading doses of antibiotics
using the following regimen: One drop every
5 minutes for five doses, then every 30 to 60
minutes around the clock.

3. In some cases, topical corticosteroids are
added after the bacterial organism and
sensitivities are known, the infection is
under control, and severe inflammation
persists. Infectious keratitis may worsen
significantly with topical corticosteroids,
especially when caused by fungus, atypical mycobacteria, or Pseudomonas.
4. Eyes with corneal thinning should be
protected by a shield without a patch (a
patch is never placed over an eye thought
to have an infection). The use of an antimetalloproteinase (e.g., doxycycline 100
mg b.i.d.) may help to suppress connective tissue breakdown and prevent the
perforation of the cornea.
5. No contact lens wear.
6. Oral pain medication as needed.
7. Oral fluoroquinolones (e.g., ciprofloxacin
500 mg p.o. b.i.d.; moxifloxacin 400 mg
p.o. q.d.) penetrate the cornea well. These
may have added benefit for patients with
scleral extension or for those with frank
or impending perforation. Ciprofloxacin
is preferred for Pseudomonas and Serratia.
8. Systemic antibiotics are also necessary
for Neisseria and Haemophilus infections
[e.g., ceftriaxone 1 g intravenously (i.v.) if
corneal involvement, or intramuscularly

LWBK1000-C04_p55-109.indd 72

(i.m.) q12–24h if there is only conjunctival involvement]. Oral fluoroquinolones
have been used for Neisseria gonorrhea,
but there is increasing resistance in some
locations and in men who have sex
with men.
9. Admission to the hospital may be necessary if:
—Infection is sight threatening.
—Patient has difficulty administering the
antibiotics at the prescribed frequency.
—High likelihood of noncompliance with
drops or daily follow-up.
—Suspected topical anesthetic abuse.
—Intravenous antibiotics are needed (e.g.,
corneal perforation, scleral extension of
the infection, gonococcal conjunctivitis
with corneal involvement).
10. For atypical mycobacteria, consider prolonged treatment (q1h for 1 week, then
gradually tapering) with one of the following topical agents: fluoroquinolones
[e.g., moxifloxacin or gatifloxacin), amikacin (15 mg/mL), clarithromycin (1%
to 4%), or tobramycin (15 mg/mL)].
Consider oral treatment with clarithromycin 500 mg b.i.d. Previous LASIK has
been implicated as a risk factor for atypical mycobacteria infections (although
recently, Staphylococcal infections have
been more common post-LASIK).
11. Bacterial coinfection may occasionally
complicate fungal (especially candidal)
and Acanthamoeba keratitis. Mixed bacterial infections can also occur.

Follow-Up
1. Daily evaluation at first, including repeated
measurements of the size of the infiltrate
and epithelial defect. The most important
criteria in evaluating treatment response
are the amount of pain, the epithelial
defect size, the size and depth of the infiltrate, and the anterior chamber reaction.
The IOP must be checked and treated if
elevated (see 9.7, Inflammatory Open-Angle
Glaucoma). Reduced pain is often the first
sign of a positive response to treatment.

21/12/11 11:59 PM

4.12

2. If improving, the antibiotic regimen is
gradually tapered but is never tapered past
the minimum dose to inhibit the emergence of resistance (usually t.i.d. to q.i.d.
depending on the agent). Otherwise, the
antibiotic regimen is adjusted according to
the culture and sensitivity results.
3. If cultures were not taken or the cultures
were negative and the infiltrate or ulcer
does not respond or subsequently worsens,
then new cultures (without stopping treatment), stains, and treatment with fortified
antibiotics are needed. Treatment is modified based on the culture results. Hospitalization may be recommended. See Appendix
8, Corneal Culture Procedure.

4.12

•

Fungal Keratitis

73

4. A corneal biopsy may be required if the
condition is worsening and infection is still
suspected despite negative cultures.
5. For an impending or a complete corneal perforation, a corneal transplant or patch graft
is considered. Cyanoacrylate tissue glue may
also work in a treated corneal ulcer that has
perforated despite infection control. Due to
concern about drug penetration, antibiotics
are often given for 1 to 2 days prior to glue
application over an active area of infection.
NOTE: Outpatients are told to return immediately if the pain increases, vision decreases, or
they notice an increase in the size of the ulcer
when they look in the mirror.

FUNGAL KERATITIS

Symptoms

Etiology

Pain, photophobia, red eye, tearing, discharge,
foreign body sensation. Often history of minor
trauma particularly with vegetable matter
(e.g., a tree branch), contact lens wear, chronic
eye disease, and/or a history of poor response
to conventional antibacterial therapy. Usually
more indolent than bacterial keratitis.

Critical.
Filamentous fungi: Corneal stromal gray-white
opacity (infiltrate) with a feathery border. The
epithelium over the infiltrate may be elevated
above the remainder of the corneal surface, or
there may be an epithelial defect with stromal
thinning (ulcer).

gillus species most commonly): Usually
from trauma with vegetable matter in previously healthy eyes. There was a Fusarium
keratitis epidemic in contact lens wearers
associated with Bausch & Lomb’s ReNu with
MoistureLoc solution (recalled May 2006).
cies): Usually in previously diseased eyes,
e.g., dry eyes, herpes simplex or zoster keratitis, exposure keratopathy, and chronic use
of corticosteroid drops (see Figure 4.12.1).

Nonfilamentous fungi: A yellow-white stromal infiltrate similar to a bacterial ulcer.
Other. Satellite lesions surrounding the
primary infiltrate, conjunctival injection,
mucopurulent discharge, anterior chamber
reaction, hypopyon. The infiltrate is more
likely to extend beyond the epithelial defect
than in bacterial ulcers.

Work-Up
See 4.11, Bacterial Keratitis for complete workup and culture procedure.
NOTE:

4

1. Whenever smears and cultures are done, include
a Gram, Giemsa, calcofluor white, or KOH stain
for organisms (periodic acid–Schiff, Gomori
methenamine silver, and H&E stains also can be
used) and scrape deep into the edge of the ulcer
for material. See Appendix 8, Corneal Culture
Procedure.
2. If an infectious etiology is still suspected despite
negative cultures, consider a corneal biopsy to
obtain further diagnostic information.
3. Consider cultures and smears of contact lens
case and solution.
4. Sometimes all tests are negative and therapeutic
penetrating keratoplasty is necessary for diagnosis
and treatment.

Treatment
Corneal infiltrates and ulcers of unknown
etiology are treated as bacterial until proven
otherwise (see 4.11, Bacterial Keratitis). If the
stains or cultures indicate a fungal keratitis,
institute the following measures:
1. Admission to the hospital may be necessary, unless the patient is reliable. It may
take weeks to achieve complete healing.
2. Natamycin 5% drops (especially for filamentous fungi) or amphotericin B 0.15%
drops (especially for Candida), initially
q1–2h around the clock, then taper over
4 to 6 weeks. Alternatively, use topical fortified voriconazole 1% q1h around the clock
(see Appendix 9, Fortified Topical Antibiotics/
Antifungals).
NOTE: Natamycin is the only commercially available topical antifungal agent; all others must be

LWBK1000-C04_p55-109.indd 74

compounded from intravenous solutions with
sterile techniques.

3. Cycloplegic (e.g., scopolamine 0.25%
t.i.d.). Use atropine 1% t.i.d. if hypopyon is
present.
4. No topical steroids. If the patient is currently taking steroids, they should be
tapered rapidly and discontinued.
5. Consider adding oral antifungal agents
(e.g., fluconazole 200 to 400 mg p.o. loading dose, then 100 to 200 mg p.o. q.d., or
voriconazole 200 mg p.o. b.i.d.). Oral fluconazole and voriconazole are often used
for deep corneal ulcers or suspected fungal
endophthalmitis.
6. Consider epithelial debridement to facilitate the penetration of antifungal medications. Topical antifungals do not penetrate
the cornea well, especially through an intact
epithelium.
7. Measure IOP with Tono-Pen. Treat elevated
IOP if present (see 9.7, Inflammatory OpenAngle Glaucoma).
8. Eye shield, without patch, in the presence
of corneal thinning.

Follow-Up
Patients are re-examined daily. However, the
initial clinical response to treatment in fungal
keratitis is much slower compared to bacterial
keratitis. Stability of infection after initiation of
treatment is often a favorable sign. Unlike bacterial ulcers, epithelial healing in fungal keratitis is not always a sign of positive response.
Fungal infections in deep corneal stroma are
frequently recalcitrant to therapy. These ulcers
may require weeks to months of treatment,
and corneal transplantation may be necessary
for infections that progress despite maximal
medical therapy or corneal perforation.

Acanthamoeba Keratitis

75

ACANTHAMOEBA KERATITIS

Acanthamoeba keratitis should be considered in
any patient with a history of soft contact lens
wear, poor contact lens hygiene (e.g., using tap
water to clean lenses, infrequent disinfection),
or swimming, fishing, hot-tub use, or trauma
while wearing contact lenses. Heat disinfection
and hydrogen peroxide systems with at least
8 hours of contact time are effective in killing
Acanthamoeba cysts and trophozoites, but are
not commercially available in the United States.
Sorbic acid, EDTA, and quaternary ammonium
compounds are mostly ineffective against Acanthamoeba cysts. The best approach to prevention
is to use daily disposable (single-use) lenses. The
best available solutions involve hydrogen peroxide exposure before neutralization, such as
Oxysept UltraCare or Clear Care. Boston rigid
gas-permeable (RGP) solutions are effective, but
contact with tap water must be avoided. A multipurpose RGP solution (e.g., Boston Simplus) and
patient education against rinsing RGP lenses in
tap water is the best approach. Although most
patients with Acanthamoeba have a history of
contact lens use, some patients do not and often
have a delayed diagnosis.

Symptoms
Severe ocular pain (often out of proportion to
the early clinical findings), redness, and photophobia over a period of several weeks.

Signs
(See Figure 4.13.1.)

Critical.
Early: Pseudodendrites on the epithelium.
Less corneal and anterior segment inflammation than expected for the degree of pain the
patient is experiencing, subepithelial infiltrates (sometimes along corneal nerves, producing a radial keratoneuritis).
Late (3 to 8 weeks): Ring-shaped corneal stromal infiltrate.

4

NOTE: Cultures for bacteria are negative. The condition usually does not improve with antibiotic or antiviral medications and commonly follows a chronic,
progressive, downhill course. Patients are often
initially misdiagnosed as having herpes simplex
keratitis. Acanthamoeba is important to consider in
patients with unresponsive HSV keratitis, as HSV keratitis usually responds well to appropriate treatment.

Other. Eyelid swelling, conjunctival injection
(especially circumcorneal), cells, and flare in the
anterior chamber. Minimal discharge or corneal
vascularization. Corneal ulceration and bacterial superinfection may occur later in the course.

Differential Diagnosis
HSV keratitis is first in the differential. See 4.11,
Bacterial Keratitis, and 4.15, Herpes Simplex Virus.

Work-Up
See 4.11, Bacterial Keratitis for a general workup. One or more of the following are obtained
when Acanthamoeba is suspected:
1. Corneal scrapings for Gram, Giemsa, and
calcofluor white stains (Giemsa and periodic
acid-Schiff stains may show typical cysts).
See Appendix 8, Corneal Culture Procedure.
2. Consider a culture on non-nutrient agar
with E. coli overlay.
3. Consider a corneal biopsy if the stains and
cultures are negative and the condition is
not improving on the current regimen.
4. Consider cultures and smears of contact
lens and case.

(PHMB) drops q1h. Chlorhexidine 0.02%
can be used as an alternative to PHMB.
2. Propamidine isethionate 0.1% drops q1h.
Dibromopropamidine isethionate 0.15%
ointment is also available.

3. Consider polymyxin B/neomycin/gramicidin drops q1h. No longer used by most
doctors.
4. Itraconazole 400 mg p.o. for one loading
dose, then 100 to 200 mg p.o. q.d., ketoconazole 200 mg p.o. q.d., or voriconazole
200 mg p.o. q.d. to b.i.d.
NOTE: Alternative therapy includes hexamidine,
clotrimazole 1% drops, miconazole 1% drops, or
paromomycin drops q2h. Low-dose corticosteroid drops may be helpful in reducing inflammation after the infection is controlled, but steroid
use is controversial.

All patients:
5. Discontinue contact lens wear in both eyes.
6. Cycloplegic (e.g., scopolamine 0.25% t.i.d.)

4.14

NOTE: Corneal transplantation may be indicated
for medical failures, but this procedure can be
complicated by recurrent infection. It is best
delayed for 3 to 12 months after medical treatment is completed.

Follow-Up
Every 1 to 4 days until the condition is consistently improving, and then every 1 to 3 weeks.
Medication may then be tapered judiciously.
Treatment is usually continued for 3 months
after resolution of inflammation, which may
take up to 6 to 12 months.
NOTE:
1. Propamidine isethionate 0.1% drops is available in the United Kingdom and other countries; it may be compounded in the United
States (e.g., Leiter pharmacy, www.leiterrx.

2. PHMB is available in the United Kingdom as
Cosmocil; it can be prepared by a compounding
pharmacy in the United States from Baquacil, a
swimming pool disinfectant.

and fungi. Patients with refractive surgery
are at a higher risk for atypical mycobacteria
and alternaria.
 Schnyder corneal dystrophy: Slowly pro-

gressive, autosomal dominant. Subepithelial corneal crystals in 50% of patients
(cholesterol and phospholipids), central
and midperipheral corneal opacification,
dense arcus, decreased corneal sensation.

but can be associated with hyperlipidemia
and hypercholesterolemia. Higher prevalence in patients with Swede–Finn descent.
See 4.26, Corneal Dystrophies.
 Bietti crystalline corneoretinal dystrophy:

Rare, autosomal recessive. Retinal crystals
(decrease with time). Sparkling, yellowwhite spots at the corneal limbus in the
superficial stroma and subepithelial layers
of the cornea.
 Cystinosis: Rare, autosomal recessive, sys-

temic metabolic defect. Infantile form
(nephropathic): dwarfism, progressive renal
dysfunction, polychromatic cystine crystals
in conjunctiva, corneal stroma (densest in
peripheral cornea but present throughout
anterior stroma), trabecular meshwork.
Intermediate/adolescent form: less severe
renal involvement. Adult form: normal life
expectancy.
 Lymphoproliferative disorders, including

monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined
significance, essential cryoglobulinemia, or
multiple myeloma.

Work-Up
1. Fasting lipid profile in patients with Schnyder corneal dystrophy.
2. Electroretinogram may be decreased in
later stages of Bietti crystalline dystrophy.
3. Cystinosis: Very high level of suspicion
required, especially for infantile form,
which can be fatal in the first decade of life
without a renal transplant. Conjunctival
biopsy, blood or bone marrow smear.

4. Infectious crystalline keratopathy: Culture
as outlined in Appendix 8, Corneal Culture
Procedure. Obtain mycobacterial cultures/
acid-fast bacillus stain (especially in patients
after refractive surgery).
5. If a lymphoproliferative disorder is suspected,
consult Hematology and consider complete blood count with differential, serum
chemistries (including calcium), creatinine,
albumin, lactate dehydrogenase, beta-2
microglobulin, c-reactive protein (CRP),
serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP), urine
protein electrophoresis (UPEP), and peripheral/bone marrow smear.

Treatment
1. Schnyder corneal dystrophy: PTK may be
effective for subepithelial crystals. Corneal
transplantation for severe cases. Diet and/
or medications for elevated cholesterol.
2. No specific treatment for Bietti crystalline
dystrophy.
3. Cystinosis: Topical cysteamine drops reduce
the density of crystalline deposits and
corneal pain. Penetrating keratoplasty for
severe cases (although corneal deposits may
recur). Patients must get systemic evaluation by primary care physician and/or
geneticist.
4. Infectious keratopathy: Treat as outlined in
4.11, Bacterial Keratitis, and 4.30, Corneal
Refractive Surgery Complications.
5. Lymphoproliferative disorder: Consult a
hematologist and/or oncologist.

HERPES SIMPLEX VIRUS

Symptoms
Red eye, pain, photophobia, tearing, decreased
vision, skin (e.g., eyelid) vesicular rash, history of previous episodes, fever blisters; usually unilateral.

Signs
Primary HSV infection is usually not apparent
clinically. However, neonatal primary herpes

infection is a rare, potentially devastating disease associated with localized skin, eye, or
oral infection and severe central nervous system and multiorgan system infection [see 8.9,
Opthalmia Neonatorum (Newborn Conjunctivitis)].
In older children, primary HSV infection may be
associated with extensive eyelid involvement
with or without oral facial HSV, follicular conjunctivitis, and often multiple conjunctival

Cornea

and corneal dendrites. Triggers for recurrence
are commonly thought to include fever,
stress, trauma, and ultraviolet light exposure
[although this clinical suspicion was not confirmed by the Herpetic Eye Disease Study
(HEDS)]. Infection may be characterized by
any or all of the following:

4

Eyelid/Skin Involvement
Clear vesicles on an erythematous base that
progress to crusting, heal without scarring and
cross dermatomes.
Conjunctivitis
Conjunctival injection with acute unilateral
follicular conjunctivitis, with or without conjunctival dendrites, geographic ulcers.
Corneal Epithelial Disease
(See Figure 4.15.1.)
May be seen as macropunctate, dendritic keratitis (a thin, linear, branching epithelial ulceration with club-shaped terminal bulbs at the
end of each branch), or a geographic ulcer
(a large, amoeba-shaped corneal ulcer with a
dendritic edge). The edges of herpetic lesions
are heaped up with swollen epithelial cells that
stain well with rose bengal or lissamine green;
the central ulceration stains well with fluorescein. Corneal sensitivity may be decreased.
Scars (ghost dendrites) may develop underneath the epithelial lesions.
Neurotrophic Ulcer
A sterile ulcer with smooth epithelial margins
over an area of interpalpebral stromal disease

that persists or worsens despite antiviral therapy. May be associated with stromal melting
and perforation.
Corneal Stromal Disease
 Disciform keratitis (non-necrotizing keratitis): Disc-shaped stromal edema with an
intact epithelium. A mild iritis with localized granulomatous keratic precipitates is
typical, and increased IOP may be present.
No necrosis or corneal neovascularization
is present.
 Necrotizing

interstitial keratitis (IK)
(uncommon): Appearance of multiple or
diffuse, whitish corneal stromal infiltrates
with or without an epithelial defect, often
accompanied by stromal inflammation,
thinning, and neovascularization. Concomitant iritis, hypopyon, or glaucoma may be
present. Microbial (bacterial and fungal)
superinfection should be ruled out.

Uveitis
An anterior chamber reaction may develop
as a result of corneal stromal involvement.
Less commonly, anterior chamber reaction
and granulomatous keratic precipitates can
develop without active corneal disease and
may be associated with very high IOP.
Retinitis
Rare. In neonates, it is usually associated with
a severe systemic HSV infection and is often
bilateral.

Differential Diagnosis of Corneal Dendrites
 Varicella zoster virus (VZV): Typically pain-

ful skin vesicles are found along a dermatomal distribution of the face, not crossing
the midline. Moderate-to-severe pain may
be present before vesicles appear. Skin
involvement is very helpful in distinguishing VZV from HSV. Early VZV dendrites can
mimic HSV dendrites. Late pseudodendrites
in VZV are raised mucous plaques. They do
not have true terminal bulbs and do not
stain well with fluorescein. See 4.16, Herpes
Zoster Ophthalmicus/Varicella Zoster Virus.
 Recurrent corneal erosion: A healing eroFIGURE 4.15.1. Herpes simplex dendritic keratitis.

dystrophy can have a geographic shape. See
4.2, Recurrent Corneal Erosion.
 Acanthamoeba

keratitis pseudodendrites:
History of soft contact lens wear, pain out
of proportion to inflammation, chronic
course. These are raised epithelial lesions,
not epithelial ulcerations. See 4.13, Acanthamoeba Keratitis.

 Vaccinia keratitis: Recent history of small-

pox vaccination or vaccine exposure. See
4.17, Ocular Vaccinia.

Work-Up
1. History: Previous episodes? History of corneal abrasion; contact lens wear; or previous nasal or oral sores? Recent topical
or systemic steroids? Immune deficiency
state? Recent fever or sun/UV exposure?
2. External examination: Note the distribution of skin vesicles if present. The lesions
are more suggestive of HSV than VZV
if concentrated around the eye without
extension onto forehead, scalp, and tip of
nose. HSV often involves both eyelids.
3. Slit-lamp examination with IOP measurement.
4. Check corneal sensation (before instillation of topical anesthetic), which may be
decreased in HSV and VZV.
5. Herpes simplex is usually diagnosed clinically and requires no confirmatory laboratory tests. If the diagnosis is in doubt, any
of the following tests may be helpful:
—Scrapings of a corneal or skin lesion
(scrape the edge of a corneal ulcer or the
base of a skin lesion) for Giemsa stain, which
shows multinucleated giant cells. Enzymelinked immunosorbent assay testing also is
available.
—Viral culture: A sterile, cotton-tipped
applicator is used to swab the cornea, conjunctiva, or skin (after unroofing vesicles
with a sterile needle) and is placed in the
viral transport medium.
—HSV antibody titers are frequently present in patients. They rise after primary
but not recurrent infection. The absence

LWBK1000-C04_p55-109.indd 79

•

Herpes Simplex Virus

79

of HSV1 antibodies helps rule out HSV as
a cause of stromal keratitis. Positive titer is
nonspecific.

Treatment
The treatment of HSV eye disease has been
refined by the findings of the HEDS. Treatment modalities supported by evidence from
HEDS are indicated by an asterisk (*).
Eyelid/Skin Involvement
1. Topical acyclovir ointment, five times per
day, is an option, although it has not been
proven effective. This is not an ocular preparation and should be used on the skin only. It
may be better to use antiviral ointment rather
than antibacterial ointment, though erythromycin or bacitracin ophthalmic ointment is
often used b.i.d. Ganciclovir 0.15% ophthalmic gel (now available in the United States)
five times per day may also be effective.

4

2. Warm or cool soaks to skin lesions t.i.d. or
p.r.n.
3. Eyelid margin involvement: Add ganciclovir 0.15% ophthalmic gel or trifluridine
1% drops, five times per day, to the eye.
Vidarabine 3% ointment five times per day
is useful for small children; it is currently
available in Canada, Europe, and in the USA
from Leiter pharmacy (www.leiterrx.com).
These medications are continued for 7 to 14
days until resolution of the symptoms.
NOTE: Many physicians give oral acyclovir 400
mg five times per day, for 7 to 14 days, to adults
suspected of having primary herpetic disease.

Conjunctivitis
Ganciclovir 0.15% ophthalmic gel, trifluridine
1% drops, or vidarabine 3% ointment five
times per day. Discontinue the antiviral agent
when the conjunctivitis has resolved after 7
to 14 days.
Corneal Epithelial Disease
1. Ganciclovir 0.15% ophthalmic gel five
times per day, trifluridine 1% drops nine
times per day, or vidarabine 3% ointment
five times per day. Oral antiviral agents
(e.g., acyclovir 400 mg p.o. five times per
day, for 7 to 10 days) may be used to avoid

the toxicity of topical antiviral drops or
when drops cannot be given due to compliance problems, especially in children.
2. Consider cycloplegic agent (e.g., scopolamine 0.25% b.i.d.) if an anterior chamber
reaction or photophobia is present.
3. Patients taking topical steroids should have
them tapered rapidly.

4

4. Consider gentle debridement of the
infected epithelium as an adjunct to the
antiviral agents.
—Technique: After topical anesthesia, a
sterile, moistened cotton-tipped applicator
or semisharp instrument is used carefully to
peel off the lesions at the slit lamp. After
debridement, antiviral treatment should be
instituted as described earlier.
5. For epithelial defects that do not resolve
after 1 to 2 weeks, noncompliance, topical antiviral toxicity, neurotrophic ulcer
or Acanthamoeba keratitis should be suspected. At that point, the topical antiviral
agent should be discontinued, and a nonpreserved artificial tear ointment or an antibiotic ointment (e.g., erythromycin) should
be used four to eight times per day for several days with careful follow-up. Smears for
Acanthamoeba should be performed whenever the diagnosis is suspected.
NOTE: Oral acyclovir does not prevent the development of stromal keratitis or uveitis in patients
with HSV epithelial keratitis.*
However, a short course of systemic acyclovir may be used when frequent topical antivirals
cannot be given.

Neurotrophic Ulcer
See 4.6, Neurotrophic Keratopathy.
Corneal Stromal Disease
1. Disciform keratitis
Mild. Consider treatment with cycloplegic
(e.g., scopolamine 0.25% b.i.d.) alone.

—Antiviral prophylaxis: Ganciclovir 0.15%
ophthalmic gel three to five times a day, trifluridine 1% t.i.d. to q.i.d., or acyclovir 400
mg p.o. b.i.d.* Oral acyclovir alone is not
effective treatment of stromal keratitis.*
Acyclovir 400 mg p.o. b.i.d. is also recommended for prophylaxis of subsequent episodes of HSV stromal keratitis.
—Adjunctive medications which may be
used include:
• Antibiotic (e.g., erythromycin ointment
q.h.s.) in the presence of epithelial defects.
• Aqueous suppressants for increased IOP.
Avoid prostaglandin analogues due to
association with recurrent HSV infections.
2. Necrotizing IK: Treated as severe disciform
keratitis. The first priority is to diagnose
and treat any associated overlying epithelial
defect and bacterial superinfection with antibiotic drops or ointment (see 4.11, Bacterial
Keratitis). Tissue adhesive or corneal transplantation may be required if the cornea
perforates (this is more common with neurotrophic keratitis). Oral acyclovir treatment
may be beneficial, but necrotizing IK was too
rare in the HED study to know definitively.
NOTE:
1. Topical steroids are contraindicated in those
with infectious epithelial disease.
2. Rarely, a systemic steroid (e.g., prednisone
40 to 60 mg p.o. q.d., tapered rapidly) is
given to patients with severe stromal disease
accompanied by an epithelial defect and
hypopyon. Cultures should be done to rule
out a superinfection.
3. Valacyclovir has greater bioavailability than
acyclovir but is more expensive. Little has
been published on famciclovir for HSV, but it
may be better tolerated in patients who have
side effects to acyclovir such as headache,
fatigue, or gastrointestinal upset.

—Cycloplegic, as above.

4. Acyclovir needs to be adjusted in patients
with renal insufficiency. Checking BUN and
creatinine is recommended in patients at risk
for renal disease before starting high-dose
acyclovir.

—Topical steroid (e.g., prednisolone acetate
1% q.i.d.).*

5. Oral antivirals (e.g., acyclovir, famciclovir,
and valacyclovir) have not been shown to be

Severe or central (i.e., vision is reduced).

Herpes Zoster Ophthalmicus/Varicella Zoster Virus

beneficial in the treatment of stromal disease
but may be beneficial in the treatment of herpetic uveitis* [see 12.1, Anterior Uveitis (Iritis/
Iridocyclitis)].
6. The persistence of an ulcer with stromal
keratitis is commonly due to the underlying inflammation (requiring cautious steroid
therapy); however, it may be due to antiviral toxicity or active HSV epithelial infection.
When an ulcer deepens, a new infiltrate
develops, or the anterior chamber reaction
increases, and smears and cultures should be
taken for bacteria and fungi. See Appendix 8,
Corneal Culture Procedure.

Follow-Up
1. Patients are reexamined in 2 to 7 days to
evaluate the response to treatment and then
every 1 to 2 weeks, depending on the clinical findings. The following clinical parameters are evaluated: the size of the epithelial
defect and ulcer, the corneal thickness and
the depth of corneal involvement, the anterior chamber reaction, and the IOP (see 9.7,
Inflammatory Open-Angle Glaucoma, for glaucoma management).
2. Antiviral medications for corneal dendrites
and geographic ulcers should be continued
five to nine times per day for 7 to 14 days

4.16

until healed, then four times per day for 4
to 7 days, then stopped.
3. Topical steroids used for corneal stromal disease are tapered slowly (often over months
to years). The initial concentration of the
steroid (e.g., prednisolone acetate 1%) is
eventually reduced (e.g., loteprednol 0.5%
or prednisolone acetate 0.125%). Extended
taper includes dosing q.o.d., twice weekly,
once weekly, etc., especially with a history of
flare-ups when steroids are stopped. Prophylactic topical antiviral agents (e.g., ganciclovir 0.15% or trifluridine 1% t.i.d.) or systemic
agents (e.g., acyclovir 400 mg b.i.d.) are used
until steroids are used once daily or less.

4

4. Corneal transplantation may eventually be
necessary if inactive postherpetic scars significantly affect vision, though an RGP lens
should be tried first.
5. Recommend long-term oral antiviral prophylaxis (e.g., acyclovir 400 mg b.i.d.) if a
patient has had multiple episodes of herpetic stromal disease.*
NOTE: Topical antivirals can cause a local toxic or
allergic reaction (usually a papillary or follicular
conjunctivitis) typically after 3 weeks of therapy.
In this setting, the patient can be switched to an
oral antiviral agent.

HERPES ZOSTER OPHTHALMICUS/
VARICELLA ZOSTER VIRUS

Symptoms
Dermatomal pain, paresthesias, and skin rash or
discomfort. May be preceded by headache, fever,
malaise, blurred vision, eye pain, and red eye.

Signs
Critical. Acute vesicular dermatomal skin
rash along the first division of the fifth cranial
nerve. Characteristically, the rash is unilateral,
respects the midline, and does not involve the
lower eyelid. Hutchinson sign (tip of the nose
involved in the distribution of the nasociliary
branch of V1) predicts higher risk of ocular
involvement.

LWBK1000-C04_p55-109.indd 81

81

Other. Less commonly, the lower eyelid
and cheek on one side (V2), and, rarely, one
side of the jaw (V3) are involved. Conjunctivitis, corneal involvement [e.g., multiple
small epithelial dendritiform lesions early,
followed by larger pseudodendrites (raised
mucous plaques which may be present on
cornea or conjunctiva, see Figure 4.16.1),
SPK, immune stromal keratitis, neurotrophic
keratitis], uveitis, sectoral iris atrophy, scleritis, retinitis, choroiditis, optic neuritis,
cranial nerve palsies, and elevated IOP can
occur. Late postherpetic neuralgia also may
occur.

dendrites.

NOTE: Corneal disease may follow the acute skin
rash by several days to weeks or months and last for
years. Occasionally, it can precede the skin rash or
there is no rash, making the diagnosis more difficult.
There is a rise in VZV titers after zoster.
HZO may be the initial manifestation of HIV, particularly in patients <40 years without known immunocompromisation.

Differential Diagnosis
 HSV: Patients are often young; rash is not

dermatomal and crosses the midline. See
4.15, Herpes Simplex Virus.

—Patients <40 years: Consider medical
evaluation for immunocompromised status, particularly HIV.
—Patients aged 40 to 60 years: None, unless
immunodeficiency is suspected from the
history.
—Patients >60 years: If systemic steroid
therapy is to be instituted, obtain a steroid
work-up as required.
—If any other organ systems or nonophthalmic sites are involved, consider
evaluation by internal medicine or other
subspecialists as needed.
NOTE: Immunocompromised patients should
not receive systemic steroids.

Herpes Zoster Ophthalmicus/Varicella Zoster Virus

Skin Involvement
1. In adults with a moderate-to-severe skin
rash for <4 days in which active skin lesions
are present and (consider) if the patient
presents later in the first week with active
lesions:
—Oral antiviral agent (e.g., acyclovir
800 mg p.o. five times per day; famciclovir
500 mg p.o. t.i.d.; or valacyclovir 1,000 mg
p.o. t.i.d.) for 7 to 10 days; if the condition
is severe, as manifested by orbital, optic
nerve, or cranial nerve involvement, or the
patient is systemically ill, hospitalize and
prescribe acyclovir 5 to 10 mg/kg i.v. q8h
for 5 to 10 days.
—Bacitracin or erythromycin ointment to
the skin lesions b.i.d.
—Warm compresses to periocular skin t.i.d.
2. Adults with a skin rash of more than 1 week
duration or without active skin lesions.
—Warm compresses to periocular skin t.i.d.
—Bacitracin or erythromycin ointment to
skin lesions b.i.d.
3. Children: Discuss with a pediatrician and
consider adjusted-dose acyclovir. Otherwise,
treat as in (2) unless evidence of systemic
spread. For systemic spread, hospitalize and
prescribe acyclovir (if >12 years of age, 30 mg/
kg/day in three divided doses; if <12 years of
age, 60 mg/kg/day in three divided doses)
for 7 days. Consult Pediatrics and Infectious
Disease to manage the systemic disease.
Ocular Involvement
1. Conjunctival involvement: Cool compresses
and erythromycin ointment to the eye b.i.d.
2. SPK: Lubrication with preservative-free artificial tears q1–2h and ointment q.h.s.
3. Corneal or conjunctival pseudodendrites:
Lubrication with preservative-free artificial
tears q1–2h and ointment q.h.s. Topical
antivirals (e.g., ganciclovir 0.15% or vidarabine 3% ointment) t.i.d. to q.i.d. may also
be helpful. Consider antibiotic ointment to
prevent bacterial superinfection.
4. Immune stromal keratitis: Topical steroid
(e.g., prednisolone acetate 1%, start q.i.d.,

LWBK1000-C04_p55-109.indd 83

adjust according to the response), tapering
over months to years using weaker steroids
and less than daily dosing.
5. Uveitis (with or without immune stromal
keratitis): Topical steroid (e.g., prednisolone acetate 1%) q.i.d. and cycloplegic (e.g.,
scopolamine 0.25% b.i.d.). See 12.1, Anterior
Uveitis (Iritis/Iridocyclitis). Treat increased IOP
with aggressive aqueous suppression; avoid
prostaglandin analogues.
6. Neurotrophic keratitis: Treat mild epithelial
defects with erythromycin ointment four
to eight times per day. If corneal ulceration
occurs, obtain appropriate smears and cultures to rule out infection (see 4.11, Bacterial Keratitis). If the ulcer is sterile, and there
is no response to ointment, consider a bandage contact lens, tarsorrhaphy, amniotic
membrane graft, or conjunctival flap (see
4.6, Neurotrophic Keratopathy).

4

7. Scleritis: See 5.7, Scleritis.
8. Retinitis, choroiditis, optic neuritis, or cranial nerve palsy: Acyclovir 5 to 10 mg/kg i.v.
q8h for 1 week and prednisone 60 mg p.o.
for 3 days, then taper over 1 week. Management of acute retinal necrosis or PORN
may require intraocular antivirals [see 12.8,
Acute Retinal Necrosis (ARN)]. Consult Infectious Disease. Recommend neurologic consultation to rule out central nervous system
involvement. Patients with severe disease
can develop a large vessel cranial arteritis
resulting in a massive CVA.
9. Increased IOP: May be steroid response
or secondary to inflammation. If uveitis
is present, increase the frequency of the
steroid administration for a few days and
use topical aqueous suppressants (e.g.,
timolol 0.5% b.i.d., brimonidine 0.2%
t.i.d., or dorzolamide 2% t.i.d.) (see 9.7,
Inflammatory Open-Angle Glaucoma, and
9.9, Steroid-Response Glaucoma). Oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitors may be necessary if the IOP is >30 mm Hg. If IOP
remains increased and the inflammation
is controlled, substitute fluorometholone
0.25%, rimexolone 1%, or loteprednol
0.5% drops for prednisolone acetate and
attempt to taper the dose.

Cornea

NOTE: Pain may be severe during the first 2 weeks,
and narcotic analgesics may be required. An antidepressant (e.g., amitriptyline 25 mg p.o. t.i.d.)
may be beneficial for both postherpetic neuralgia
and depression that can develop in VZV. Capsaicin
0.025% or doxepin ointment may be applied to the
skin t.i.d. to q.i.d. after the rash heals (not around
the eyes) for postherpetic neuralgia. Oral gabapentin or pregabalin can be helpful for acute pain and
for postherpetic neuralgia. Management of postherpetic neuralgia should involve the patient’s primary
medical doctor.

Follow-Up
If ocular involvement is present, examine
the patient every 1 to 7 days, depending on
the severity. Patients without ocular involvement can be followed every 1 to 4 weeks.
After the acute episode resolves, check the
patient every 3 to 6 months (3 if on steroids) because relapses may occur months
to years later, particularly as steroids are
tapered. Systemic steroid use is controversial
and requires collaboration with the patient’s
internist.
NOTE: VZV is contagious for children and adults
who have not had chickenpox or the chickenpox
vaccine and is spread by inhalation. Varicella-naïve
pregnant women must be especially careful to avoid
contact with an VZV-infected patient. A vaccine for
VZV is recommended by the FDA for people aged
60 years or older; it was demonstrated to decrease
the frequency and severity of HZO versus placebo.

optic neuritis, retinitis, and ophthalmoplegia
occur rarely.
Late (weeks to months after the outbreak).
Immune stromal or neurotrophic keratitis.

Treatment
1. Conjunctival involvement and/or corneal
epithelial lesions: Cool compresses and
erythromycin ointment t.i.d. to the eye
and periorbital lesions.
2. Stromal keratitis with uveitis: Topical steroid (e.g., prednisolone acetate 1% q.i.d.),
cycloplegic (e.g., scopolamine 0.25% b.i.d.),
and erythromycin ointment q.h.s.
3. Neurotrophic keratitis: Uncommon; see
4.6, Neurotrophic Keratopathy.
4. Canalicular obstruction: Uncommon. Managed by intubation of puncta.
NOTE:
1. Aspirin is contraindicated because of the risk
of Reye syndrome in children.
2. Immunocompromised children with chicken
pox may require i.v. acyclovir.
3. Varicella zoster virus vaccination is available
and will likely prevent ophthalmic complications of chicken pox in immunocompetent
patients if given at least 8 to 12 weeks before
exposure.

severity of ocular disease. Taper the topical
steroids slowly.
2. Watch for stromal or neurotrophic keratitis approximately 4 to 6 weeks after the
chicken pox resolves. Stromal keratitis can

Ocular Vaccinia

85

OCULAR VACCINIA

Symptoms

Etiology

Red eye, pain, photophobia, tearing, itching,
decreased vision, eyelid swelling, vesicular or
pustular skin rash; malaise, fever, history of
recent smallpox vaccination or exposure to
vaccine directly or indirectly.

Vaccinia virus may be shed from the inoculation site for 3 weeks after vaccination. The
virus is spread by contact and replicates at a
new site. The most common sites for inadvertent vaccinia inoculation are the eye and
ocular adnexae. Patients with past or current
inflammatory skin diseases (e.g., atopic dermatitis, seborrheic dermatitis) are at higher
risk. The incubation period is 5 to 19 days.
Approximately one per 30,000 to 40,000 vaccinations results in ocular vaccinia.

Signs
Eyelid/Skin Involvement
Acute blepharitis: Nondermatomal distribution of vesicles that progress into pustules,
which umbilicate and indurate. Severe eyelid
edema and erythema; periorbital cellulitis.
Lymphadenopathy may be present.
Conjunctivitis
Acute papillary conjunctivitis, often with
mucopurulent discharge and an inflammatory membrane. Ulcers of the conjunctiva are
common. Symblepharon may follow. Limbal
pustules have also been noted.
Keratitis (Uncommon)
Similar to HSV: SPK, corneal dendrites, or a geographic epithelial ulcer. Focal or diffuse stromal
edema; stromal infiltrate or ulceration, sometimes with necrosis and rarely perforation; late
corneal scarring or clouding may develop; secondary uveitis and elevated IOP may occur.

Differential Diagnosis
 HSV: Vesicles do not become pustules. Den-

drites of HSV have true terminal bulbs and
stain well with fluorescein. See 4.15, Herpes
Simplex Virus.
 HZO: Vesicles obey the midline, are derma-

tomal in distribution, and do not become
pustules. See 4.16, Herpes Zoster Ophthalmicus/Varicella Zoster Virus.
 Chicken pox (Varicella zoster): Systemic ill-

ness, common during childhood. See 4.16,
Herpes Zoster Ophthalmicus/Varicella Zoster
Virus.
 Molluscum contagiosum: Skin lesions are

umbilicated, but not vesicular or pustular.
See 5.2, Chronic Conjunctivitis.

LWBK1000-C04_p55-109.indd 85

Work-Up
1. History: Recent smallpox vaccination?
Exposure to someone recently vaccinated?
History of work with vaccinia (laboratory)?
History of previous nasal or oral sores? History of exposure to chicken pox? Recent
topical or systemic steroids? Immune deficiency state? History of atopic dermatitis?
2. External examination: Note the distribution of skin vesicles, if present.
3. Slit-lamp examination with IOP measurement.
4. Check corneal sensation (before instillation
of anesthetic), which may be decreased in
HSV and HZO.
5. Most cases of ocular vaccinia are diagnosed
clinically and require no confirmatory laboratory tests. If the diagnosis is in doubt,
viral studies may be obtained (including
culture, polymerase chain reaction, and
restriction endonuclease analysis).
NOTE: Smears and cultures for bacteria should be
taken to rule out superinfection if a corneal ulceration suddenly worsens. See Appendix 8, Corneal
Culture Procedure.

Treatment
Ocular vaccinia is usually self-limiting. The
goal of treatment is to decrease the severity of
the disease. Counsel patients on contact precautions to prevent disease spread.

Cornea

Eyelid/Skin Involvement (Without Keratitis)
1. Ganciclovir 0.15% ophthalmic gel or trifluridine 1% drops five times per day for 2 weeks
(may substitute vidarabine 3% ointment five
times per day for children, if available).
2. Topical antibiotic ointment (e.g., bacitracin) to skin lesions b.i.d.
3. If severe (e.g., cellulitis and fever), add vaccinia immune globulin (VIG) 100 mg/kg
i.m. Repeat in 48 hours if not improved.

4

Conjunctivitis (Without Keratitis)
1. Ganciclovir 0.15% ophthalmic gel five
times a day or trifluridine 1% drops eight
times per day for 2 weeks (may substitute
vidarabine 3% ointment five times per day
for children, if available).
2. Topical antibiotic ointment (e.g., bacitracin) b.i.d.

b. After the epithelium heals, cautiously
add topical steroid (dose depends on
severity) and slowly taper (while using
prophylactic topical antivirals).
4. VIG is relatively contraindicated for
patients with isolated vaccinia keratitis.
However, it should not be withheld from
patients when keratitis accompanies a serious nonocular condition (e.g., progressive
vaccinia, eczema vaccinatum), or the ocular involvement is progressing on topical
antivirals.
NOTE: VIG is currently available only through
the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

Follow-Up

4. If severe (e.g., with ulceration, membrane,
fever) and no improvement in 48 hours,
VIG administration may be repeated.

1. Vaccinia dermatitis and conjunctivitis usually resolve in 7 days. Patients are reexamined in 2 to 7 days to evaluate the response
to treatment and then every 7 to 14 days,
depending on the clinical findings.

Keratitis
1. Ganciclovir 0.15% ophthalmic gel five
times a day or trifluridine 1% drops eight
times per day for 1 to 2 weeks, then taper,
and discontinue over a week (may substitute vidarabine 3% ointment five times per
day for children, if available).

2. The following clinical parameters are evaluated: epithelial defect and ulcer size, corneal thinning and the depth to which the
cornea is involved, the anterior chamber
reaction, and the IOP (see 9.7, Inflammatory
Open-Angle Glaucoma, for glaucoma management).

3. VIG 100 mg/kg i.m. or 6,000 units/kg i.v.

2. Topical antibiotic ointment (e.g., bacitracin) b.i.d. to q.i.d. (if epithelial defect).
3. If severe (e.g., with infiltrate or ulcer), add
a. Cycloplegic agent (e.g., scopolamine
0.25% b.i.d.).

4.18

4. Topical steroids used for corneal stromal disease are tapered slowly. Prophylactic topical
antiviral agents are used while on steroids.

INTERSTITIAL KERATITIS

Acute symptomatic IK most commonly
occurs within the first or second decade
of life. Signs of old IK often persist through
life.

Signs
Acute Phase
Critical. Marked corneal stromal blood vessels and edema.

LWBK1000-C04_p55-109.indd 86

3. Topical antiviral medications should be
continued for 2 weeks.

Other. Anterior chamber cells and flare, fine
keratic precipitates on the corneal endothelium, conjunctival injection.
Chronic Phase
(See Figure 4.18.1.)
Deep corneal haze or scarring, corneal stromal
blood vessels containing minimal or no blood
(ghost vessels), stromal thinning.

(VDRL, correlates with disease activity) or
rapid plasma reagin (RPR); fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption (FTA-ABS, stays
positive after treatment) or microhemagglutination-Treponema pallidum (MHA-TP). See
12.12, Syphilis.
6. Purified protein derivative (PPD).
7. Chest radiograph if negative FTA-ABS (or
MHA-TP) or positive PPD.

Treatment
Etiology
More Common. Congenital syphilis (usually bilateral, often occurs in the first or second decade of life, affects both eyes within
1 year of each other, common for late inactive, uncommon for acute).
Common. Acquired syphilis (unilateral,
often sectoral); tuberculosis (TB) (unilateral,
often sectoral); Cogan syndrome [bilateral
involvement, vertigo, tinnitus, hearing loss,
negative syphilis serologies, often associated
with systemic vasculitis (typically polyarteritis
nodosa), can occur at any age]; leprosy; HSV;
VZV; EBV; Lyme disease.

1. Acute disease
—Topical cycloplegic.
—Topical steroid (e.g., prednisolone acetate
1% q2h depending on the degree of inflammation).
—Treat any underlying disease.
2. Old inactive disease with central scarring
—Corneal transplantation may improve
vision if minimal amblyopia is present.
—Late decrease in vision often due to cataracts.
3. Acute or old inactive disease

Work-Up
For active IK and old, previously untreated IK:
1. History: Venereal disease in the mother
during pregnancy or in the patient? Difficulty hearing or tinnitus?
2. External examination: Look for saddle-nose
deformity, Hutchinson teeth, frontal bossing,
or other signs of congenital syphilis. Look for
hypopigmented or anesthetic skin lesions
and thickened skin folds, loss of the temporal
eyebrow, and loss of eyelashes, as in leprosy.
3. Slit-lamp examination: Examine corneal
nerves for segmental thickening, like beads
on a string (leprosy). Examine the iris for
nodules (leprosy) and hyperemia with
fleshy, pink nodules (syphilis). Check IOP.
4. Dilated fundus examination: Classic saltand-pepper chorioretinitis or optic atrophy
of syphilis.

LWBK1000-C04_p55-109.indd 87

—If FTA-ABS is positive and the patient has
not been treated for syphilis in the past (or
is unsure about treatment), there are signs of
active syphilitic disease (e.g., active chorioretinitis or papillitis), or if the VDRL or RPR titer
is positive and has not declined the expected
amount after treatment, then treatment for
syphilis is indicated. See 12.12, Syphilis.
—If PPD is positive and the patient is <35
years and has not been treated for TB in the
past, or there is evidence of active systemic
TB (e.g., positive finding on chest radiograph), then refer the patient to an internist for TB treatment.
—If Cogan syndrome is present, refer the
patient to an otolaryngologist and rheumatologist.
—If Lyme titers are positive, treat per 13.3,
Lyme Disease.

chamber reaction. Not usually multiple and
recurrent. See 4.11, Bacterial Keratitis.
trates: See 4.23, Peripheral Corneal Thinning/
Ulceration.

Etiology
Infiltrates are believed to be a noninfectious
reaction of the host’s antibodies to bacterial antigens in the setting of staphylococcal
blepharitis.
NOTE: Patients with ocular rosacea (e.g., meibomian gland inflammation and telangiectasias of the
eyelids) are also susceptible to this condition.

Work-Up
1. History: Recurrent episodes? Contact lens
wearer (a risk factor for infection)?
2. Slit-lamp examination with fluorescein
staining and IOP check.
3. If an infectious infiltrate is suspected, then
corneal scrapings for cultures and smears
should be obtained. See Appendix 8, Corneal Culture Procedure.

Treatment

FIGURE 4.19.1. Staphylococcal hypersensitivity.

Mild
Warm compresses, eyelid hygiene, and a fluoroquinolone antibiotic q.i.d. and bacitracin ophthalmic ointment q.h.s. (see 5.8, Blepharitis/
Meibomitis).

21/12/11 11:59 PM

4.20

Moderate to Severe
—Treat as described earlier, but add a lowdose topical steroid (e.g., loteprednol 0.2%
to 0.5% or prednisolone 0.25% q.i.d.) with
an antibiotic (e.g., trimethoprim/polymyxin B or a fluoroquinolone q.i.d.). A
combination antibiotic/steroid can also be
used q.i.d. (e.g., loteprednol 0.5%/tobramycin or dexamethasone/tobramycin). Never
use steroids without antibiotic coverage.
Maintain until the symptoms improve and
then slowly taper.
—If episodes recur despite eyelid hygiene,
add systemic tetracycline (250 mg p.o.
q.i.d. for 1 to 2 weeks, then b.i.d. for
1 month, and then q.d.) or doxycycline
(100 mg p.o. b.i.d., for 2 weeks, and
then q.d. for 1 month, and then 50 to
100 mg q.d., titrated as necessary) until
the ocular disease is controlled for several months. These medications have an

action. Topical azithromycin q.h.s. or cyclosporine b.i.d. may be helpful in controlling
eyelid inflammation.
—Low-dose antibiotics (e.g., bacitracin
ointment q.h.s.) may have to be maintained indefinitely.
NOTE: Tetracycline and doxycycline are contraindicated in children <8 years, pregnant
women, and breast-feeding mothers. Erythromycin 200 mg p.o. one to two times per day
can be used in children to decrease recurrent
disease.

7. If the PPD or chest radiograph is positive for
TB, refer the patient to an internist or infectious disease specialist for management.

Follow-Up
Recheck in several days. Healing usually occurs
over a 10- to 14-day period, with a residual
stromal scar. When the symptoms have significantly improved, slowly taper the steroid.
Maintain the antibiotic ointment and eyelid
hygiene indefinitely. Continue oral antibiotics for 3 to 6 months. Topical azithromycin or
cyclosporine may be beneficial steroid-sparing
agents in patients with recurrent inflammation.

CONTACT LENS-RELATED PROBLEMS

Symptoms
Pain, photophobia, foreign body sensation,
decreased vision, red eye, itching, discharge,
burning, contact lens intolerance.

LWBK1000-C04_p55-109.indd 90

4. Artificial tears four to six times per day.

NOTE: Any contact lens wearer with pain or redness should remove the lens immediately and have
a thorough ophthalmic examination as soon as possible if symptoms persist or worsen.

21/12/11 11:59 PM

4.21

Signs
See the distinguishing characteristics of each
etiology.

Etiology
 Infectious corneal infiltrate/ulcer (bacte-

rial, fungal, Acanthamoeba): White corneal
lesion that may stain with fluorescein. Must
always be ruled out in contact lens patients
with eye pain. See 4.11, Bacterial Keratitis,
4.12, Fungal Keratitis, and 4.13, Acanthamoeba Keratitis.
 Giant

papillary conjunctivitis: Itching,
mucous discharge and lens intolerance in
a patient with large superior tarsal conjunctival papillae. See 4.22, Contact Lens-Induced
Giant Papillary Conjunctivitis.

 Hypersensitivity/toxicity reactions to pre-

servatives in solutions: Conjunctival injection and ocular irritation typically develop
shortly after lens cleaning and insertion, but
can be present chronically. A recent change
from one type or brand of solution is common. Occurred more often in patients using
older preserved solutions (e.g., thimerosal
or chlorhexidine as a component), but also
is seen with newer “all-purpose” solutions.
May be due to inadequate rinsing of lenses
after enzyme use. Signs include SPK, conjunctival injection, bulbar conjunctival
follicles, subepithelial or stromal corneal
infiltrates, superior epithelial irregularities,
and superficial scarring.
 Contact lens deposits: Multiple small depos-

its on the contact lens, leading to corneal
and conjunctival irritation. The contact lens
is often old and may not have been cleaned
or enzyme-treated properly in the past.
 Tight lens syndrome: Symptoms may be

severe and often develop within 1 or 2 days
of contact lens fitting (usually a soft lens),
especially if patient sleeps overnight with
daily-wear lenses. No lens movement with
blinking and lens appears “sucked-on” to
the cornea (this can occur after rewearing a
soft lens that has dried out and then been
rehydrated). An imprint in the conjunctiva
is often observed after the lens is removed.
Central corneal edema, SPK, anterior

Contact Lens-Related Problems

91

chamber reaction, and sometimes a sterile
hypopyon may develop.
 Corneal warpage: Seen predominantly in

long-term polymethylmethacrylate hard
contact lens wearers. Initially, the vision
becomes blurred with glasses (“spectacle
blur”) but remains good with contact lenses.
Keratometry reveals distorted mires and
corneal topography shows irregular astigmatism that eventually resolves after lens
discontinuation.
 Corneal neovascularization: Patients are often

4

asymptomatic until the visual axis is involved.
Superficial corneal neovascularization for 1
mm is common and usually not a concern in
aphakic contact lens wearers. With any sign of
chronic hypoxia, the goal is to increase oxygen permeability, increase movement, and
discontinue extended-wear lenses.
 Dry eyes/inadequate/incomplete blinking/

thick RGP lenses: Can lead to chronic inflammation, staining, and in some cases scarring, at the 3- and 9-o’clock positions.
 Contact lens keratopathy (pseudosuperior

limbic keratoconjunctivitis): Hyperemia and
fluorescein staining of the superior bulbar
conjunctiva, particularly at the limbus. SPK,
subepithelial infiltrates, haze, and irregularity may be found on the superior cornea.
This may represent a hypersensitivity or toxicity reaction to preservatives in contact lens
solutions (classically thimerosal, but newer
preservatives as well). No corneal filaments,
papillary reaction, or association with thyroid disease.
 Displaced contact lens: Most commonly the

lens has actually fallen out of the eye and
been lost. If retained, lens usually found in
the superior fornix and may require doubleeversion of the upper eyelid to remove. Fluorescein will stain a soft lens to aid in finding it.
 Others: Contact lens inside out, corneal

abrasion (see 3.2, Corneal Abrasion), poor
lens fit, damaged contact lens, change in
refractive error.

or single-use daily disposable)? Age of the
lenses? Continuous time lenses are worn?
Sleeping in lenses? How are the lenses
cleaned and disinfected? Are enzyme tablets
used? Preservative-free products? Recent
changes in contact lens habits or solutions?
How is the pain related to wearing time? Is
the pain relieved by removal of the lens?

2. In noninfectious conditions, while the contact lens is still in the eye, evaluate its fit
and examine its surface for deposits and
defects at the slit lamp.
3. Remove lens and examine the eye with
fluorescein. Evert the upper eyelids of both
eyes and inspect the superior tarsal conjunctiva for papillae.
4. Smears and cultures are taken when an
infectious corneal ulcer is suspected with
infiltrate >1 mm or when an unusual organism is suspected (i.e., Acanthamoeba or fungus). See 4.11, Bacterial Keratitis, 4.12, Fungal
Keratitis, 4.13, Acanthamoeba Keratitis, and
Appendix 8, Corneal Culture Procedure.
5. The contact lenses and lens case are also
cultured occasionally.

Treatment
When the diagnosis of infection is suspected:
1. Discontinue contact lens wear.
2. Antibiotic treatment regimen varies with
diagnosis as follows.
Possible Corneal Ulcer (Corneal Infiltrate, Epithelial
Defect, Anterior Chamber Reaction, Pain)
a. Obtain appropriate smears and cultures. See Appendix 8, Corneal Culture
Procedure.
b. Start intensive topical antibiotics, fortified or a fluoroquinolone (given every 30
minutes initially), and a cycloplegic. See
4.11, Bacterial Keratitis.
Small Subepithelial Infiltrates, Corneal Abrasion, or
Diffuse SPK
a. Topical antibiotic (e.g., fluoroquinolone)
drops four to eight times per day and a
cycloplegic.

LWBK1000-C04_p55-109.indd 92

b. Can also add tobramycin or bacitracin/
polymyxin B ointment q.h.s. Beware of
toxicity with long-term use (especially
tobramycin).
c. For an abrasion, use tobramycin, bacitracin/polymyxin B, or ciprofloxacin ointment four to eight times per day. Avoid
steroids.
NOTE: Never pressure patch a contact lens
wearer because of the risk of rapid development of Pseudomonas infection.

When a specific contact lens problem is suspected, it may be treated as follows:
Giant Papillary Conjunctivitis (see 4.22, Contact
Lens-Induced Giant Papillary Conjunctivitis)
Hypersensitivity/Toxicity Reaction
a. Discontinue contact lens wear.
b. Preservative-free artificial tears four to
six times per day.
c. On resolution of the condition, the patient may return to new contact lenses,
preferably daily disposable lenses. If the
patient desires frequent-replacement or
conventional lenses, hydrogen peroxidebased systems are recommended, and
appropriate lens hygiene is reviewed.
Contact Lens Deposits
a. Discontinue contact lens wear.
b. Replace with a new contact lens once the
symptoms resolve. Consider changing the
brand of contact lens, or change to daily
disposable or frequent replacement lens.
c. Teach proper contact lens care, stressing
weekly enzyme treatments for lenses replaced less frequently than every 2 weeks.
Tight Lens Syndrome
a. Discontinue contact lens wear.
b. Consider a topical cycloplegic (e.g., scopolamine 0.25% b.i.d.) in the presence
of an anterior chamber reaction.
c. Once resolved, refit patients with a flatter and more oxygen-permeable contact
lens. Discontinue extended-wear contact lenses.

21/12/11 11:59 PM

4.21

d. If a soft lens has dried out, discard and
refit.
NOTE: Patients with hypopyon do not need
to be cultured when tight lens syndrome is
highly suspected (i.e., if surface intact, with
edema but no infiltrate).

Corneal Warpage
a. Discontinue contact lens wear. Explain
to patients that vision may be poor for
the following 2 to 6 weeks, and they
may require a change in spectacle prescription. May need to discontinue
lenses one eye at a time so patient can
function.
b. A gas-permeable hard contact lens should
be refitted when the refraction and keratometric readings have stabilized.

b. Consider a topical steroid (e.g., prednisolone 1% q.i.d. or loteprednol 0.5% q.i.d.)
for extensive deep neovascularization
(rarely necessary).
c. Refit carefully with a highly oxygentransmissible daily-wear disposable contact lens that moves adequately over the
cornea.

93

Pseudosuperior Limbic Keratoconjunctivitis
a. Treat as described for hypersensitivity/
toxicity reactions. Use unit dose preservative-free tear. Consider bandage contact
lens if needed to improve vision. When
a large subepithelial opacity extends toward the visual axis, topical steroids may
be added cautiously (e.g., loteprednol
0.5% q.i.d.), but they are often ineffective. Steroid use in contact lens-related
problems should have concomitant antibiotic coverage.

4

Displaced Lens
a. Inspect lens carefully for damage.
If undamaged, clean, and disinfect
lens, then recheck fit when symptoms
have resolved. If damaged, discard and
replace.

1. Next day if infection cannot be ruled out.
Treatment is maintained until the condition clears.
2. In noninfectious conditions, reevaluate
in 1 to 4 weeks, depending on the clinical situation. Contact lens wear is resumed
when the condition resolves. Patients using
topical steroids should be followed up more
closely and their IOP monitored.
The following regimen for contact lens care is
one we recommend if single-use daily disposable lenses are not possible.

Corneal Epithelial Changes
a. Discontinue contact lens wear.
b. Use preservative-free artificial tears.
c. Consider a new contact lens when the
epithelial changes resolve, which may
take weeks or months.

Contact Lens-Related Problems

Follow-Up

Corneal Neovascularization
a. Discontinue contact lens wear.

Inadequate/Incomplete Blinking
a. Frequent
preservative-free
tears.

•

1. Daily cleaning and disinfection with
removal of lenses while sleeping for all
lens types, including those approved for
“extended wear” and “overnight wear.” We
prefer standard rather than hyperoxygentransmissible lenses for frequent replacement, as the latter may allow greater adherence for organisms.
2. Daily cleaning regimen for soft contact
lenses:
—Preservative-free daily cleaner.
—Preservative-free saline.
—Disinfectant, preferably hydrogen peroxide type.

2. Slit-lamp examination: Evert the upper
eyelids and examine for large papillae
(≥1 mm).

Critical. Giant papillae on the superior tarsal conjunctiva (see Figure 4.22.1).

Treatment

NOTE: The upper eyelid must be everted to make
the diagnosis. Upper eyelid eversion should be part
of the routine eye examination in any patient who
wears contact lenses.

Mild-to-Moderate Giant Papillary Conjunctivitis
a. Replace and refit the contact lens. Consider planned replacement or daily disposable lenses (daily disposable lenses
are preferred).

Other. Contact lens coatings, high-riding
lens, mild conjunctival injection, ptosis (usually a late sign).

b. Reduce contact lens-wearing time (switch
from extended-wear contact lens to
daily-wear).

3. In unusually severe cases, short-term use of
a low-dose topical steroid may be considered (e.g., loteprednol 0.2% to 0.5% q.i.d.).
Contact lenses should not be worn while
using a topical steroid.

Follow-Up

Symptoms may improve before papillae
resolve. Mast cell stabilizers are continued
while the signs remain, and they may need to
be used chronically to maintain contact lens
tolerance.
NOTE: Giant papillary conjunctivitis can also result
from atopic/vernal conjunctivitis, an exposed
suture, or an ocular prosthesis. Exposed sutures
are removed. Prostheses should be cleaned and
polished. A coating can be placed on the prosthesis to reduce giant papillary conjunctivitis.
Otherwise, these entities are treated as described
earlier.

PERIPHERAL CORNEAL
THINNING/ULCERATION

Symptoms
Pain, photophobia, red eye; may be asymptomatic.

Signs
Peripheral corneal thinning (best seen with a
narrow slit beam), may have a sterile infiltrate
or ulcer.

Differential Diagnosis
Infectious infiltrate or ulcer. Lesions are often
treated as infectious until cultures come back
negative. See 4.11, Bacterial Keratitis.

Etiology
 Connective tissue disease (e.g., rheumatoid

arthritis, Wegener granulomatosis, relapsing polychondritis, polyarteritis nodosa,
systemic lupus erythematosus, others).
Peripheral (unilateral or bilateral) corneal
thinning/ulcers may be associated with
inflammatory infiltrates. May progress circumferentially to involve the entire peripheral cornea. Perforation may occur. This
may be the first manifestation of systemic
disease (see Figure 4.23.1).

superior; more often in men. The anterior
chamber is quiet, and the eye is typically not
injected. A yellow line (lipid) may appear,
with a fine pannus over the thinned areas
of involvement. The thinning may slowly
spread circumferentially. Irregular and
against-the-rule astigmatism is often present.
The epithelium usually remains intact, but
perforation may occur with minor trauma.
 Mooren ulcer: Unilateral or bilateral; idio-

pathic (autoimmunity may play a key role);
diagnosis of exclusion. Painful corneal thinning and ulceration with inflammation; initially starts as a focal area in the peripheral
cornea nasally or temporally without limbal
sparing with subsequent extension circumferentially or centrally. An epithelial defect,

tomatic; usually bilateral; slowly progressive
thinning of the peripheral cornea; typically

Cornea

stromal thinning, and a leading undermined
edge are present. Limbal blood vessels may
grow into the ulcer, and perforation can
occur. Mooren-like ulcer has been associated
with systemic hepatitis C virus infection.
 Pellucid marginal degeneration: Painless,

4

bilateral asymmetric corneal thinning of the
inferior peripheral cornea (usually from the
4- to 8-o’clock portions). There is no anterior
chamber reaction, conjunctival injection,
lipid deposition, or vascularization. The epithelium is intact. Corneal protrusion may be
seen above the area of thinning. The thinning may slowly progress.
 Furrow

degeneration: Painless corneal
thinning just peripheral to an arcus senilis, typically in the elderly. Noninflammatory without vascularization. Perforation is
rare. Usually nonprogressive and does not
require treatment.

 Delle:

Painless oval corneal thinning
resulting from corneal drying and stromal
dehydration adjacent to an abnormal conjunctival or corneal elevation. The epithelium is usually intact. See 4.24, Dellen.

 Staphylococcal hypersensitivity/marginal ker-

atitis: Peripheral, white corneal infiltrate(s)
with limbal clearing that may have an epithelial defect and mild thinning. See 4.19,
Staphylococcal Hypersensitivity.
 Dry-eye syndrome: Peripheral (or central)

sterile corneal melts may result from severe
cases of dry eye. See 4.3, Dry-Eye Syndrome.
 Exposure/neurotrophic keratopathy: Typi-

cally, a sterile oval ulcer develops inferiorly
on the cornea without signs of significant
inflammation. May be associated with an
eyelid abnormality, a fifth or seventh cranial nerve defect, or proptosis. The ulcer
may become superinfected. See 4.5, Exposure Keratopathy, and 4.6, Neurotrophic Keratopathy.
 Sclerokeratitis: Corneal ulceration is asso-

ciated with severe radiating ocular pain
because of accompanying scleritis. The
sclera develops a blue hue, scleral vessels
are engorged, and scleral edema with or
without nodules is present. An underly-

LWBK1000-C04_p55-109.indd 96

ing connective tissue disease, especially
Wegener granulomatosis, must be ruled
out. See 5.7, Scleritis.
 Vernal keratoconjunctivitis: Superior, shal-

low, shield-shaped, sterile corneal infiltrate/
ulcer, accompanied by giant papillae on the
superior tarsal conjunctiva or limbus, with
or without degenerated limbal eosinophils
(Horner–Trantas dots). The conjunctivitis is
usually bilateral, often occurs in children,
and recurs during the summer months, but
it can occur anytime in warm climates. See
5.1, Acute Conjunctivitis.
 Ocular rosacea: Typically affects the inferior

cornea in middle-aged patients. Erythema
and telangiectasia of the eyelid margins,
corneal neovascularization. See 5.9, Ocular
Rosacea.
 Others:

Cataract surgery, inflammatory
bowel disease, previous HSV or VZV infections, and leukemia can rarely cause peripheral corneal thinning/ulceration.

Work-Up
1. History: Contact lens wearer or previous
HSV or VZV keratitis? Connective tissue
disease or inflammatory bowel disease?
Other systemic symptoms? Seasonal conjunctivitis with itching (vernal)? Prior ocular surgery?
2. External examination: Old facial scars of
VZV? Eyelid-closure problem causing exposure? Blue tinge to the sclera? Rosacea facies?
3. Slit-lamp examination: Look for infiltrate,
corneal ulcer, hypopyon, uveitis, scleritis,
old herpetic corneal scarring, poor tear
lake, SPK, blepharitis. Look for giant papillae on the superior tarsal conjunctiva or
limbal papillae. Measure IOP.
4. Schirmer test (see 4.3, Dry-Eye Syndrome).
5. Dilated fundus examination: Look for cotton-wool spots consistent with connective
tissue disease or evidence of posterior scleritis (e.g., vitritis, subretinal fluid, chorioretinal folds, exudative retinal detachment).
6. Corneal scrapings and cultures when infection is suspected. See Appendix 8, Corneal
Culture Procedure.

7. Systemic work-up including serum antinuclear antibody, rheumatoid factor, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, antineutrophilic
cytoplasmic antibody levels, complement
CH50, C3, C4, angiotension-converting
enzyme, chest x-ray, and complete blood
count with differential to rule out connective tissue disease and leukemia.
8. Scleritis work-up, when present (see 5.7,
Scleritis).
9. Refer to an internist (or rheumatologist)
when connective tissue disease is suspected.

Treatment
See sections on dellen, staphylococcal hypersensitivity, dry-eye syndrome, exposure and
neurotrophic keratopathies, scleritis, vernal
conjunctivitis, and ocular rosacea.
1. Corneal thinning due to connective tissue
disease: Management is usually coordinated with a rheumatologist or internist.
—Antibiotic ointment (e.g., erythromycin
ointment q2h) or preservative-free ointment.
—Cycloplegic drops (e.g., scopolamine 0.25%
or atropine 1% b.i.d. to t.i.d.) when an anterior chamber reaction or pain is present.
—Consider doxycycline 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.
because of its metalloproteinase inhibition
properties.
—Systemic steroids (e.g., prednisone 60 to
100 mg p.o. q.d.; the dosage is adjusted
according to the response) and a histamine
type 2 receptor (H2) blocker (e.g., ranitidine 150 mg p.o. b.i.d.) are used for significant and progressive corneal thinning, but
not for perforation.
—An immunosuppressive agent (e.g.,
methotrexate, mycophenolate mofetil, infliximab, azathioprine, cyclophosphamide)
is often required, especially for Wegener
granulomatosis. This should be done in
coordination with the patient’s internist or
rheumatologist.
—Excision of adjacent inflamed conjunctiva is occasionally helpful when the condition progresses despite treatment.

LWBK1000-C04_p55-109.indd 97

Peripheral Corneal Thinning/Ulceration

97

—Punctal occlusion if dry-eye syndrome is
present. Typical cyclosporine 0.05% to 2%
b.i.d. to q.i.d. also may be helpful. Experimental research suggests benefits of oral
omega-3 fatty acids for severe dry-eye syndrome.
—Consider cyanoacrylate tissue adhesive
or corneal transplantation surgery for an
impending or actual corneal perforation.
A conjunctival flap or amniotic membrane
graft can also be used for an impending corneal perforation.

4

—Patients with significant corneal thinning should wear their glasses [or protective
glasses (e.g., polycarbonate lens)] during the
day and an eye shield at night.
NOTE: Topical steroids are usually not used in the
presence of significant corneal thinning because
of the risk of perforation. Gradually taper topical
steroids if the patient is already taking them. Corneal thinning due to relapsing polychondritis,
however, seems to improve with topical steroids
(e.g., prednisolone acetate 1% q1–2h).

2. Terrien marginal degeneration: Correct
astigmatism with glasses or contact lenses if
possible. Protective eyewear should be worn
if significant thinning is present. Lamellar
grafts can be used if thinning is extreme.
3. Mooren ulcer: Underlying systemic diseases
must be ruled out before this diagnosis can be
made. Topical corticosteroids, topical cyclosporine 0.05% to 2%, limbal conjunctival
excision, corneal gluing, and lamellar keratoplasty may be beneficial. Systemic immunosuppressants (e.g., oral corticosteroids,
methotrexate, cyclophosphamide, and cyclosporine) are indicated and may be lifesaving.
See treatment for corneal thinning secondary
to connective tissue disease above.
4. Pellucid marginal degeneration: See 4.25,
Keratoconus.
5. Furrow degeneration: No treatment is
required.
NOTE: If systemic steroid therapy is to be instituted, obtain a steroid work-up as indicated and
involve the patient’s primary medical doctor.

Critical. Corneal thinning, usually at the
limbus, often in the shape of an ellipse,
accompanied by an adjacent focal conjunctival or corneal elevation.
Other. Fluorescein pooling in the area, but
minimal staining. No infiltrate, no anterior chamber reaction, minimal-to-moderate
hyperemia.

Differential Diagnosis
See 4.23, Peripheral Corneal Thinning/Ulceration.

Etiology
Poor spread of the tear film over a focal area of
cornea (with resultant stromal dehydration)
due to an adjacent surface elevation (e.g.,
chemosis, conjunctival hemorrhage, filtering
bleb, pterygium, tumor, and poststrabismus
surgery).

Progressive decreased vision, usually beginning in adolescence and continuing into
middle age. Acute corneal hydrops can cause a
sudden decrease in vision, pain, red eye, photophobia, and profuse tearing.

(See Figure 4.25.1.)

LWBK1000-C04_p55-109.indd 98

Treatment
1. Lubricating or antibiotic ointment every
2 to 4 hours and q.h.s. Maintain the ointment at least q.h.s. until the adjacent elevation is eliminated.
2. If the cause cannot be removed (e.g., filtering bleb), lubricating ointment should be
applied nightly, and viscous artificial tear
drops should be used four to eight times
per day. If drops are needed more than
four times per day, a preservative-free drop
should be used.

Follow-Up
Unless there is severe thinning, reexamination can be performed in 1 to 7 days, at which
time the cornea can be expected to be of normal thickness. If it is not, full-time patching
and lubrication should again be instituted.

injection), increased IOP, and progressive corneal thinning. Treatment is maintained until
the epithelial defect over the ulcer heals and is
then gradually tapered. As long as an epithelial defect is present, there is risk of progressive
thinning and perforation.

Critical. Slowly progressive irregular astigmatism resulting from paracentral thinning and
bulging of the cornea (maximal thinning near
the apex of the protrusion), vertical tension lines
in the posterior cornea (Vogt striae), an irregular
corneal retinoscopic reflex (scissor reflex), and
egg-shaped mires on keratometry. Inferior steepening is seen on corneal topographic evaluation.
Usually bilateral but often asymmetric.

Keratoconus

99

 Keratoglobus: Rare, congenital, nonpro-

gressive. Uniform circularly thinned cornea
with maximal thinning in the mid-periphery of the cornea. The cornea protrudes
central to the area of maximal thinning.
NOTE: Treatment for pellucid marginal degeneration is the same as for keratoconus, except
corneal transplantation is technically more difficult due to peripheral thinning and has a higher
failure rate because larger grafts are necessary.

FIGURE 4.25.1. Keratoconus.

Other. Fleischer ring (epithelial iron deposits at the base of the cone), bulging of the
lower eyelid when looking downward (Munson sign), superficial corneal scarring. Corneal hydrops (sudden development of corneal
edema) results from a rupture in Descemet
membrane (see Figure 4.25.2).

Associations
Keratoconus is associated with Down syndrome, atopic disease, Turner syndrome, Leber
congenital amaurosis, mitral valve prolapse,
retinitis pigmentosa, and Marfan syndrome. It
is related to chronic eye rubbing. Family history of keratoconus is also a risk factor.

Differential Diagnosis
 Pellucid marginal degeneration: Corneal

thinning in the inferior periphery, 1 to 2
mm from the limbus. The cornea protrudes
superior to the band of thinning.

 Postrefractive surgery ectasia: After lamellar

4

refractive surgery such as LASIK, and rarely
surface ablation, a condition very similar to
keratoconus can develop. It is treated in the
same manner as keratoconus.

Work-Up
1. History: Duration and rate of decreased
vision? Frequent change in eyeglass prescriptions? History of eye rubbing? Medical
problems? Allergies? Family history? Previous refractive surgery?
2. Slit-lamp examination with close attention
to location and characteristics of corneal
thinning, Vogt striae, and a Fleischer ring
(may be best appreciated with cobalt blue
light).
3. Retinoscopy and refraction. Look for irregular astigmatism and a waterdrop or scissors red reflex.
4. Corneal topography (can show central and
inferior steepening) and keratometry (irregular mires and steepening).

Treatment
1. Patients are instructed not to rub their eyes.
2. Correct refractive errors with glasses or soft
contact lenses (for mild cases) or RGP contact lenses (successful in most cases). Occasionally, hybrid contact lenses are required.
3. Partial thickness or full-thickness corneal
transplantation surgery is usually indicated
when contact lenses cannot be tolerated or
no longer produce satisfactory vision.

5. Corneal collagen cross-linking: A surgical procedure where typically a large corneal epithelial defect is created, riboflavin
drops are placed on the cornea for 30 minutes and then ultraviolet light is shined
on the cornea for another 30 minutes.
The goal is to “cross-link” collagen bonds
in the cornea to strengthen it and slow
down (ideally eliminate) the progression
of keratoconus. It is not currently FDA
approved.
6. Acute corneal hydrops:
—Cycloplegic agent (e.g., cyclopentolate
1%), bacitracin ointment q.i.d., and consider brimonidine 0.1% b.i.d. to t.i.d.

4.26

—Start sodium chloride 5% ointment b.i.d.
until resolved (usually several weeks to
months).
—Glasses or a shield should be worn by
patients at risk for trauma or by those who
rub their eyes.
NOTE: Acute hydrops is not an indication for
emergency corneal transplantation, except in
the extremely rare case of corneal perforation
(which is first treated medically and sometimes
with tissue adhesives).

Follow-Up
Every 3 to 12 months, depending on the progression of symptoms. After an episode of
hydrops, examine the patient every 1 to 4 weeks
until resolved (which can take several months).

CORNEAL DYSTROPHIES

Bilateral, inherited, progressive corneal disorders without inflammation or corneal neovascularization. Most are autosomal dominant
disorders, except macular dystrophy and type
3 lattice dystrophy (autosomal recessive).

ANTERIOR CORNEAL DYSTROPHIES

until middle age. Retroillumination shows
discrete, tiny epithelial vesicles diffusely
involving the cornea but concentrated in the
palpebral fissure. Although treatment is usually not required, bandage soft contact lenses
or superficial keratectomy may be beneficial if
significant photophobia is present or if visual
acuity is severely affected.

Epithelial Basement Membrane Dystrophy
(Map–Dot–Fingerprint Dystrophy)

Corneal Dystrophy of Bowman Layer Type I
(Reis–Bücklers) and Type II (Thiel–Behnke)

Most common anterior dystrophy. Diffuse
gray patches (maps), creamy white cysts
(dots), or fine refractile lines (fingerprints) in
the corneal epithelium, best seen with retroillumination or a broad slit-lamp beam angled
from the side. Spontaneous painful corneal
erosions may develop, particularly on opening the eyes after sleep. May cause decreased
vision, monocular diplopia, and shadow
images. See 4.2, Recurrent Corneal Erosion, for
treatment.

Appears early in life. Subepithelial, gray reticular opacities are seen primarily in the central
cornea. Painful episodes from recurrent erosions are relatively common and require treatment. Corneal transplantation surgery may
be necessary to improve vision, but the dystrophy often recurs in the graft. Excimer laser
PTK or superficial lamellar keratectomy may
be adequate treatment in many cases.

Meesmann Dystrophy

When these conditions cause reduced vision,
patients usually benefit from a corneal transplant or PTK.

Rare, epithelial dystrophy that is seen in the
first years of life, but is usually asymptomatic

CORNEAL STROMAL DYSTROPHIES

21/12/11 11:59 PM

4.26

Lattice Dystrophy
Four clinical forms. Type 1 (Biber–Haab–Dimmer, most common): refractile branching
lines, white subepithelial dots, and scarring
of the corneal stroma centrally, best seen
with retroillumination. Recurrent erosions
are common (see 4.2, Recurrent Corneal Erosion). The corneal periphery is typically clear.
Tends to recur within 3 to 5 years after PTK
or corneal transplantation. Type 2 (Meretoja
syndrome): associated with systemic amyloidosis, facial mask, ear abnormalities, cranial
and peripheral nerve palsies, dry and lax skin).
Type 3 and 4: Symptoms delayed until fifth to
seventh decades.

Granular Dystrophy
White anterior stromal deposits in the central
cornea, separated by discrete clear intervening
spaces (“bread-crumb-like” opacities). The corneal periphery is spared. Appears in the first
decade of life but rarely becomes symptomatic
before adulthood. Erosions are uncommon.
Also may recur after PTK or corneal transplantation within 3 to 5 years.

Macular Dystrophy
Gray-white stromal opacities with ill-defined
edges extending from limbus to limbus with
cloudy intervening spaces. Can involve the
full thickness of the stroma, more superficial
centrally and deeper peripherally. Causes late
decreased vision more commonly than recurrent erosions. May recur many years after corneal transplantation.

Posterior Polymorphous Dystrophy
Changes at the level of Descemet membrane,
including vesicles arranged in a linear or
grouped pattern, gray haze, or broad bands
with irregular, scalloped edges. Iris abnormalities, including iridocorneal adhesions
and corectopia (a decentered pupil), may be
present and are occasionally associated with
corneal edema. Glaucoma may occur. See
8.12, Developmental Anterior Segment and Lens
Anomalies/Dysgenesis, for differential diagnosis. Treatment includes management of corneal edema and corneal transplantation for
severe cases.

Congenital Hereditary Endothelial Dystrophy
Bilateral corneal edema with normal corneal
diameter, normal IOP, and no cornea guttata (see 8.11, Congenital/Infantile Glaucoma,

Signs

4

(See Figure 4.27.1.)
Critical. Cornea guttata with stromal edema.
Bilateral, but may be asymmetric.
NOTE: Central cornea guttata without stromal
edema is called endothelial dystrophy. This condition may progress to Fuchs dystrophy over years.

Other. Fine pigment dusting on the endothelium, central epithelial edema and bullae,
folds in Descemet membrane, subepithelial
haze, or scarring.

Differential Diagnosis
 Aphakic or pseudophakic bullous keratopa-

thy: History of cataract surgery, unilateral.
See 4.28, Aphakic Bullous Keratopathy/Pseudophakic Bullous Keratopathy.
 Congenital hereditary endothelial dystro-

phy: Bilateral corneal edema at birth. See
4.26, Corneal Dystrophies.
 Posterior polymorphous dystrophy: Seen

early in life. Corneal endothelium shows
either grouped vesicles, geographic gray

lesions, or broad bands. Occasionally corneal edema. See 4.26, Corneal Dystrophies.
 Iridocorneal endothelial (ICE) syndrome:

“Beaten metal” corneal endothelial appearance, with corneal edema, increased IOP,
variable iris thinning, and pupil distortion.
Typically unilateral, in young to middleaged adults. See 9.15, Iridocorneal Endothelial Syndrome.

Work-Up
1. History: Previous cataract surgery?
2. Slit-lamp examination: Cornea guttata are
best seen with retroillumination. Fluorescein staining may demonstrate intact or
ruptured bullae.
3. Measure IOP.
4. Consider specular microscopy to evaluate the
endothelial cells and corneal pachymetry to
determine the central corneal thickness.

Treatment
1. Topical sodium chloride 5% drops q.i.d.
and ointment q.h.s.
2. May gently blow warm air from a hair dryer
at arm’s length toward the eyes for a few minutes every morning to dehydrate the cornea.
3. IOP reduction if needed.
4. Ruptured corneal bullae are painful and
should be treated as recurrent erosions (see
4.2, Recurrent Corneal Erosion).
5. Endothelial keratoplasty such as Descemet
stripping endothelial keratoplasty (DSEK)
is usually indicated when visual acuity
decreases due to corneal edema, or penetrating keratoplasty (PK) if anterior stromal
scarring is present.

Follow-Up

(or intermittently touching) the cornea, preexisting endothelial dysfunction.

Work-Up
1. Slit-lamp examination: Stain the cornea
with fluorescein to check for denuded epithelium, check the position of the intraocular lens if present, determine whether
vitreous is touching the corneal endothelium, and evaluate the eye for inflammation. Check for subepithelial haze or

FIGURE 4.28.1. Pseudophakic bullous keratopathy.

scarring. Evaluate the fellow eye for endothelial dystrophy.
2. Check IOP.
3. Dilated fundus examination: Look for
CME.
4. Consider a fluorescein angiogram or optical coherence tomography to help detect
CME.

4

Treatment
1. Topical sodium chloride 5% drops q.i.d.
and ointment q.h.s., if epithelial edema is
present.
2. Reduce IOP with medications if increased.
Avoid epinephrine derivatives and prostaglandin analogs, if possible, because of the
risk of CME (see 9.1, Primary Open-Angle
Glaucoma).
3. Ruptured epithelial bullae (producing corneal epithelial defects) may be treated with:
a. An antibiotic ointment (e.g., erythromycin), a cycloplegic (e.g., scopolamine
0.25%). The antibiotic ointment can
be used frequently (e.g., q2h) without
patching.
b. Alternatively, sodium chloride 5% ointment q.i.d., a bandage soft contact lens,
or, in patients with limited visual potential, anterior stromal micropuncture
or PTK can be used for recurrent ruptured epithelial bullae (see 4.2, Recurrent
Corneal Erosion).
4. Full-thickness corneal transplant or endothelial keratoplasty such as DSEK (in
patients with posterior chamber intraocular lenses), combined with possible intraocular lens repositioning, replacement, or
removal and/or vitrectomy, is indicated
when vision fails or when the disease
becomes advanced and painful. Conjunctival flap or amniotic membrane graft surgery may be indicated for a painful eye
with poor visual potential.

5. See 11.14, Cystoid Macular Edema, for treatment of CME.
NOTE: Although both CME and corneal disease may
contribute to decreased vision, the precise role of
each is often difficult to determine preoperatively.
CME is less likely with a posterior chamber intraocular

lens than a closed-loop anterior chamber intraocular
lens.

Follow-Up
In 24 to 48 hours, for ruptured bullae until the
epithelial defect heals. Otherwise, every 1 to 6
months, depending on the symptoms.

CORNEAL GRAFT REJECTION

Symptoms
Decreased vision, mild pain, redness, and
photophobia with prior corneal transplantation, usually several weeks to years previously.
Posterior lamellar grafts [e.g., DSEK (Descemet
stripping endothelial keratoplasty) and DLEK
(deep lamellar endothelial keratoplasty)] are
also at risk for endothelial rejection. Often
asymptomatic and diagnosed on routine follow-up examination.

Signs
(See Figure 4.29.1.)
Critical. New keratic precipitates localized to
the donor endothelium associated with stromal edema, a line of keratic precipitates on the
corneal endothelium (endothelial rejection
line or Khodadoust line), subepithelial infiltrates (early rejection), an irregularly elevated

epithelial line (epithelial rejection line—early
in post-op course), or localized stromal neovascularization and infiltrate.
Other. Conjunctival injection (particularly
circumcorneal), anterior chamber inflammation, neovascularization growing up to
or extending onto the graft, broken graft
suture. Tearing may occur, but discharge is
not present.

Differential Diagnosis
 Suture abscess or corneal infection: May

have a corneal infiltrate, hypopyon, or a
purulent discharge. Remove the suture (by
pulling the contaminated portion through
the shortest track possible) and obtain
smears and cultures, including a culture
of the suture. Steroid frequency is usually
reduced slowly. Treat with intensive topical
fluoroquinolone or fortified antibiotics and
monitor closely, sometimes in the hospital.
See 4.11, Bacterial Keratitis.
 Uveitis: Anterior chamber cells and flare

with keratic precipitates. Often, a previous
history of uveitis is obtained, but it is best
to treat as if it were a graft rejection. See
Chapter 12, Uveitis.
 Increased IOP: A markedly increased IOP

may produce epithelial corneal edema
without other graft rejection signs. Edema
clears after the IOP is reduced.

•

Work-Up
1. History: Time since corneal transplantation? Current eye medications? Recent
change in topical steroid regimen? Indication for corneal transplantation (e.g.,
HSV)?
2. Slit-lamp examination, with careful inspection for endothelial rejection line, keratic
precipitates, subepithelial infiltrates, and
other signs listed above.

Treatment
Endothelial Rejection (Endothelial Rejection Line,
Corneal Edema, and/or Keratic Precipitates):
1. Topical steroids (e.g., prednisolone acetate
1% q1h or difluprednate 0.05% q2h while
awake and dexamethasone 0.1% ointment
q.h.s.).
2. If rejection is severe, recurrent, or recalcitrant, consider systemic steroids (e.g.,
prednisone 40 to 80 mg p.o. q.d.) or,
rarely, subconjunctival steroids (e.g., betamethasone 3 mg in 0.5 mL). In high-risk
patients with severe rejection, consider
hospitalization and single-pulse or threepulse treatment with methylprednisolone
500 mg i.v.

4.30

Corneal Refractive Surgery Complications

3. In select cases, other systemic immunosuppressives may be considered including
cyclosporine and rarely tacrolimus.
4. Cycloplegic agent (e.g., scopolamine 0.25%
b.i.d. to t.i.d.).
5. Control IOP if increased. See 9.7, Inflammatory Open-Angle Glaucoma.
6. Topical cyclosporine 0.05% to 2% b.i.d. to
q.i.d. may be helpful in the treatment and
prevention of graft rejection.
Epithelial and Stromal Rejection (Subepithelial
Infiltrates or Epithelial Rejection Line):
1. Double the current level of topical steroids or use prednisolone acetate 1% q.i.d.
(whichever is more).

4

2. Cycloplegic agent, topical cyclosporine,
and IOP control as above.

Follow-Up
Institute treatment immediately to maximize
the likelihood of graft survival. Examine the
patient every 3 to 7 days. Once improvement
is noted, the steroids are tapered very slowly
and may need to be maintained at low doses
for months to years. IOP must be checked regularly in patients taking topical steroids.

CORNEAL REFRACTIVE SURGERY
COMPLICATIONS

The basic principle of corneal refractive surgery
is to induce a change in the curvature of the
cornea to correct a preexisting refractive error.

COMPLICATIONS OF SURFACE ABLATION
PROCEDURES (PHOTOREFRACTIVE KERATECTOMY,
LASER SUBEPITHELIAL KERATECTOMY, AND
EPITHELIAL-LASER IN SITU KERATOMILEUSIS)

moved to the side before laser ablation of
the stroma, and then repositioned centrally.
In epithelial-laser in situ keratomileusis (epiLASIK), the epithelium is mechanically separated from the Bowman layer, moved to the
side before laser ablation of the stroma, and
then repositioned centrally or discarded (see
Table 4.30.1).

Symptoms
In photorefractive keratectomy (PRK), the
corneal epithelium is removed and the corneal stroma is ablated using an argon–fluoride excimer laser (193 nm, ultraviolet) to
correct a refractive error. In laser subepithelial keratectomy (LASEK), the epithelium is
chemically separated from the Bowman layer,

LWBK1000-C04_p55-109.indd 105

Early (1 to 14 days). Decreasing visual acuity, increased pain.
NOTE: The induced epithelial defect at surgery,
which usually takes a few days to heal, normally will
cause a certain amount of postoperative pain.

Treatment and Follow-Up
1. Visually significant stromal folds: Lift flap
and refloat within 24 hours. Flap dislocation: Requires urgent surgical repositioning. Persistent symptomatic flap striae may
require flap lifting and suturing.
2. Lost corneal flap: Treat as epithelial defect.
See 3.2, Corneal Abrasion.
3. Epithelial defect. See 3.2, Corneal Abrasion.
4. SPK. See 4.1, Superficial Punctate Keratopathy,
and 4.3, Dry-Eye Syndrome.
5. DLK: Aggressive treatment with frequent
topical steroids (e.g., prednisolone acetate
1% q1h). If severe, may also require lifting of flap and irrigation of interface. Treat
any underlying cause, such as an epithelial
defect.
6. Corneal infiltrate. See 4.11, Bacterial Keratitis, and Appendix 8, Corneal Culture Procedure. The flap may need to be lifted to
obtain the best culture results.
7. Epithelial ingrowth: Observation if very
peripheral and not affecting vision. Surgical debridement if dense, affecting the
health of flap, approaching visual axis, or
affecting vision.

8. Corneal haze: Increase steroid drop frequency. Follow-up in 1 to 2 weeks.
9. Refractive error or irregular astigmatism:
Appropriate refraction. Consider repositioning flap or LASIK enhancement. If
irregular astigmatism, may need surface
ablation, LASIK enhancement, or hard
contact lens.

COMPLICATIONS OF RADIAL KERATOTOMY
In radial keratotomy (RK), partial-thickness,
spokelike cuts are made in the peripheral
cornea using a diamond blade (often 90% to
95% depth), which results in a flattening of
the central cornea and correction of myopia. Astigmatic keratotomy (AK) is a similar
procedure in which arcuate or tangential
relaxing incisions are made to correct astigmatism.

Symptoms
Early (1 to 14 days). Decreasing visual acuity,
increased pain.
Later (2 weeks to years). Decreasing visual
acuity, severe glare, monocular diplopia.
NOTE: RK weakens the corneal integrity placing
patients at higher risk for rupture after trauma.

Signs
Corneal infiltrate, large fluorescein-staining
epithelial defect, rupture at RK incision site
after trauma, anterior chamber reaction.

Etiology
Early
 Large epithelial defect. See 3.2, Corneal
Abrasion.

Work-Up
No conjunctival cultures/swabs are indicated unless discharge is excessive or the
condition becomes chronic (see 5.2, Chronic
Conjunctivitis).

 Pharyngoconjunctival fever: Associated with

pharyngitis and fever; usually in children.
 Acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis: Associated

with a large subconjunctival hemorrhage,
coxsackie and enterovirus, 1 to 2 weeks duration. Tends to occur in tropical regions.
NOTE: Many systemic viral syndromes (e.g., measles, mumps, influenza) can cause a nonspecific
conjunctivitis. The underlying condition should be
managed appropriately; the eyes are treated with
artificial tears four to eight times per day. If tears are
used greater than four times daily, preservative-free
unit-dose tears should be used.

Treatment
1. Counsel the patient that viral conjunctivitis is a self-limited condition that typically
gets worse for the first 4 to 7 days after
onset and may not resolve for 2 to 3 weeks
or longer with corneal involvement.
2. Viral conjunctivitis is highly contagious,
usually for 10 to 12 days from onset, as long
as the eyes are red (when not on steroids).
Patients should avoid touching their eyes,
shaking hands, sharing towels or pillows,
etc. Restrict work and school for patients
with significant exposure to others while
the eyes are red and weeping.
3. Frequent handwashing.
4. Preservative-free artificial tears four to eight
times per day for 1 to 3 weeks. Use singleuse vials to limit tip contamination and
spread of the condition.
5. Cool compresses several times per day.
6. Antihistamine drops (e.g., epinastine 0.05%
b.i.d.) if itching is severe.
7. If a membrane/pseudomembrane present,
it may be gently peeled or left.

topical steroids. For membranes/pseudomembranes, use a more frequent steroid
dose or stronger steroid (e.g., loteprednol
0.5% q.i.d.) and consider a steroid ointment
(e.g., fluorometholone 0.1% ointment q.i.d.
or dexamethasone/tobramycin 0.1%/0.3%
ointment q.i.d.) in the presence of significant tearing to maintain longer medication
exposure. For SEIs, a weaker steroid with less
frequent dosing is usually sufficient (e.g.,
loteprednol 0.2% b.i.d.). Given the possible
side effects, prescription of topical steroids is
cautionary in the emergency room setting or
in patients with questionable follow-up. Steroids may hasten the resolution of the symptoms but prolong the infectious period. Steroid treatment is maintained for 1 week and
then slowly tapered. SEIs can recur during or
after tapering.
NOTE: Routine use of topical antibiotics for viral
conjunctivitis is discouraged unless erosions are
present or in severe cases.

FIGURE 5.1.5.

Allergic conjunctivitis.

Chemosis, red and edematous eyelids, conjunctival papillae, no preauricular node.

Treatment
1. Eliminate the inciting agent. Frequent
washing of hair and clothes may be helpful.
2. Cool compresses several times per day.
3. Topical drops, depending on the severity.

Follow-Up
In 2 to 3 weeks, but sooner if the condition
worsens significantly or if topical steroids are
prescribed.

HERPES SIMPLEX VIRUS CONJUNCTIVITIS
See 4.15, Herpes Simplex Virus, for a detailed discussion. Patients may have a history of perioral
cold sores. Manifests with a unilateral (sometimes
recurrent) follicular conjunctival reaction, palpable preauricular node, and, occasionally, concurrent herpetic skin vesicles along the eyelid margin
or periocular skin. Treat with antiviral therapy
(e.g., trifluridine 1% drops or ganciclovir 0.05%
gel five times per day) and cool compresses. Steroids are contraindicated.

ALLERGIC CONJUNCTIVITIS
Symptoms

—Mild: Artificial tears four to eight times
per day.
—Moderate: Use olopatadine 0.1% to 0.2%,
epinastine 0.05%, nedocromil 2%, bepotastine 1.5%, or ketotifen 0.025% (over-thecounter) b.i.d. to help relieve itching. Ketorolac 0.5%, pemirolast 0.1%, and lodoxamide
0.1% q.i.d. can also reduce symptoms.
—Severe: Mild topical steroid (e.g., loteprednol 0.2% or fluorometholone 0.1% q.i.d.
for 1 to 2 weeks) in addition to the preceding medications.
4. Oral antihistamine (e.g., diphenhydramine
25 mg p.o. t.i.d. to q.i.d. or loratadine
10 mg p.o. q.d.) in moderate-to-severe cases
can be very helpful.
NOTE: Routine use of topical antibiotics or steroids for allergic conjunctivitis is discouraged.

Itching, watery discharge, and a history of
allergies are typical. Usually bilateral.

Follow-Up

Signs

Two weeks. If topical steroids are used, tapering is required and patients should be monitored for side effects.

VERNAL/ATOPIC CONJUNCTIVITIS
Symptoms
Usually bilateral but possibly asymmetric itching, thick, ropy discharge, especially in boys.
Seasonal (spring/ summer) recurrences in vernal, history of atopy in atopic conjunctivitis.
Vernal conjunctivitis is usually seen in younger
patients.

Signs
Critical. Large conjunctival papillae seen
under the upper eyelid or along the limbus
(limbal vernal) (see Figure 5.1.6).
Other. Superior corneal “shield” ulcer (a
well-delineated, sterile, gray-white infiltrate),
limbal raised white dots (Horner–Trantas dots)
of degenerated eosinophils (see Figure 5.1.7),
superficial punctate keratopathy (SPK).

Treatment
1. Treat as for allergic except prophylactically
use a mast cell stabilizer (e.g., lodoxamide
0.1% q.i.d. or pemirolast 0.1% q.i.d.), or
a mast cell stabilizer and/or antihistamine
(e.g., nedocromil 2% b.i.d., olopatadine
0.1% b.i.d., ketotifen 0.025%, bepotastine
1.5%, or azelastine 0.05%) for 2 to 3 weeks
before the allergy season starts.
2. If a shield ulcer is present, add:
—Topical steroid (e.g., loteprednol 0.5%
or prednisolone 1% drops, dexamethasone
0.1% ointment) four to six times per day.

Conjunctiva/Sclera/Iris/External Disease

BACTERIAL CONJUNCTIVITIS (NONGONOCOCCAL)
Symptoms

Signs

Redness, foreign body sensation, discharge;
itching is much less prominent.

Critical. Severe purulent discharge, hyperacute onset (within 12 to 24 hours).

Signs

Other. Conjunctival papillae, marked chemosis, preauricular adenopathy, eyelid swelling. See 8.9, Ophthalmia Neonatorum (Newborn
Conjunctivitis), for a detailed discussion of
gonococcal conjunctivitis in the newborn.

Critical. Purulent white-yellow discharge of
mild-to-moderate degree.
Other. Conjunctival papillae, chemosis, preauricular node typically absent but is often
present in gonococcal conjunctivitis.

Etiology

5

GONOCOCCAL CONJUNCTIVITIS

Commonly, Staphylococcus aureus (associated
with blepharitis, phlyctenules, and marginal
sterile infiltrates), Staphylococcus epidermidis, Haemophilus influenzae (especially in children and
commonly associated with otitis media), Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Moraxella catarrhalis.
NOTE: Suspect gonococcus if onset is hyperacute
with significant discharge, see this chapter Gonococcal
Conjunctivitis.

Work-Up
If severe, recurrent, or recalcitrant, conjunctival swab for routine cultures and sensitivities
(blood and chocolate agar) and immediate
Gram stain to evaluate for gonococcus.

Treatment
1. Use topical antibiotic therapy (e.g., trimethoprim/polymyxin B or fluoroquinolone
drops q.i.d.) for 5 to 7 days.

Work-Up
1. Examine the entire cornea for peripheral
ulcers (especially superiorly) because of the
risk for rapid progression to perforation.
(see Figure 5.1.8).
2. Conjunctival scrapings for immediate
Gram stain and for culture and sensitivities
(e.g., blood agar and chocolate agar).

Treatment
Initiated if the Gram stain shows Gramnegative intracellular diplococci or there is
a high clinical suspicion of gonococcal conjunctivitis.
1. Ceftriaxone 1 g intramuscularly (i.m.) in a
single dose. If corneal involvement exists,
or cannot be excluded because of chemosis
and eyelid swelling, hospitalize the patient
and treat with ceftriaxone 1 g intravenously
(i.v.) every 12 to 24 hours. The duration of
treatment depends on the clinical response.
In penicillin-allergic patients, consider an

2. H. influenzae conjunctivitis should be
treated with oral amoxicillin/clavulanate
(20 to 40 mg/kg/day in three divided doses)
because of occasional extraocular involvement (e.g., otitis media, pneumonia, and
meningitis).
3. If associated with dacryocystitis, systemic
antibiotics are necessary. See 6.9, Dacryocystitis/Inflammation of the Lacrimal Sac.

Follow-Up
Every 2 to 3 days initially, then every 5 to 7 days
until resolved. Antibiotic therapy is adjusted
according to culture and sensitivity results.

oral fluoroquinolone (e.g., ciprofloxacin
500 mg p.o. b.i.d. for 5 days) and consider
consulting an infectious disease specialist (fluoroquinolones are contraindicated
in pregnant women and children). Additionally, due to increased resistance, fluoroquinolones should not be used to treat
gonococcal infections in men who have
sex with men, in areas of high endemic
resistance, and in patients with a recent
foreign travel history. For penicillin-allergic patients with the above characteristics, one possible treatment alternative is
a single dose of azithromycin 1 g p.o. An
infectious disease consultation should be
considered.

Treatment

Follow-Up
Daily until consistent improvement is noted
and then every 2 to 3 days until the condition resolves. The patient and sexual partners
should be evaluated by their medical doctors
for other sexually transmitted diseases.

PEDICULOSIS (LICE, CRABS)
Typically develops from contact with pubic
lice (usually sexually transmitted). Can be
unilateral or bilateral.

Symptoms
Itching, mild conjunctival injection.

4. Treat for possible chlamydial coinfection
(e.g., azithromycin 1 g p.o. single dose or
doxycycline 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. for 7 days).

Acute Conjunctivitis

Critical. Adult lice, nits, and blood-tinged
debris on the eyelids and eyelashes.
Other. Follicular conjunctivitis.

1. Mechanical removal of lice and eggs with
jeweler’s forceps.
2. Any bland ophthalmic ointment (e.g.,
erythromycin) to the eyelids t.i.d. for
10 days to smother the lice and nits.
3. Antilice lotion and shampoo as directed to
nonocular areas for patient and close contacts.
4. Thoroughly wash and dry all clothes and
linens.
NOTE: In children, pediculosis is suspicious for possible sexual abuse and involvement of social services
and/or child protection agency is recommended.

then 5 mg/kg daily for four doses); alternatives include trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole DS p.o. b.i.d.; or ciprofloxacin 500 mg
p.o. b.i.d. Duration should be individualized. Use a topical antibiotic (e.g., bacitracin/polymyxin B ointment or gentamicin
drops q.i.d.). The cat does not need to be
removed.
—Tularemia: Tobramycin 5 mg/kg/day
in three divided doses q8h or gentamicin
(same dosing) for 7 to 14 days. Gentamicin
drops q2h for 1 week, and then five times

Critical. Thickening, inflammation, and
radial injection of the superior bulbar conjunctiva, especially at the limbus.
Other. Fine papillae on the superior palpebral conjunctiva; fine punctate fluorescein
staining on the superior cornea, limbus, and

conjunctiva; superior corneal micropannus
and filaments. Usually bilateral.

Work-Up
1. History: Recurrent episodes? Thyroid disease?
2. Slit-lamp examination with fluorescein
staining, particularly of the superior cornea and adjacent conjunctiva. Lift the
upper eyelid to see the superior limbal
area and then evert to visualize the tarsus.
Sometimes the localized hyperemia is best
appreciated by direct inspection by raising
the eyelids of the patient on downgaze.

and increased IOP), or orbital fracture]. See
3.14, Ruptured Globe And Penetrating Ocular
Injury, 3.10, Traumatic Retrobulbar Hemorrhage, 3.9, Orbital Blow-out Fracture.
3. Check blood pressure.
4. If the patient has recurrent subconjunctival
hemorrhages or a history of bleeding problems, a bleeding time, prothrombin time,
partial thromboplastin time, complete
blood count with differential (to evaluate
for leukemia), liver function tests, and protein C and S should be obtained.
5. If orbital signs are present (proptosis,
decreased extraocular motility, elevated
IOP) in atraumatic cases, perform axial and
coronal computed tomographic scanning of

the orbits with and without contrast to evaluate for an orbital mass (e.g., neuroblastoma
in children or lymphangioma in adults). In
traumatic cases, image as appropriate (see
3.9, Orbital Blow-Out Fracture).

Treatment
None required. Artificial tear drops q.i.d. can
be given if mild ocular irritation is present.
In addition, elective use of aspirin products
and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
(NSAIDs) should be discouraged if possible in
the context of coexisting medical conditions.

Follow-Up
Usually clears spontaneously within 2 to
3 weeks. Patients are told to return if the blood
does not fully resolve or if they experience a
recurrence. Referral to an internist or family
physician should be made as indicated for
hypertension or a bleeding diathesis.

EPISCLERITIS

Symptoms
Acute onset of redness and mild pain in one or
both eyes, typically in young adults; a history
of recurrent episodes is common. No discharge.

Signs
(See Figure 5.6.1.)
Critical. Sectoral (and, less commonly, diffuse) redness of one or both eyes, mostly due

to engorgement of the episcleral vessels. These
vessels are large and run in a radial direction
beneath the conjunctiva.
Other. Mild-to-moderate tenderness over the
area of episcleral injection or a nodule that
can be moved slightly over the underlying
sclera may be seen. Fluorescein staining can
sometimes be seen over the nodule. Associated anterior uveitis and corneal involvement
are rare. Vision is normal.

Differential Diagnosis
 Scleritis: Typically older patient. May have

known underlying immune-mediated disease (e.g., collagen vascular disease). Pain is
deep, severe, and often radiates to the ipsilateral side of the head or face. The sclera
may have a bluish hue when observed in
natural light. Scleral (and deep episcleral)
vessels, as well as conjunctival and superficial episcleral vessels, are injected. The
scleral vessels do not blanch on application
of topical phenylephrine 2.5%. Possible

solution. Must be considered in all contact
lens wearers. See 4.21, Contact Lens-Related
Problems.

Etiology
 Idiopathic: Most common.
 Infectious: Herpes zoster virus (scars from

an old facial rash may be present, may
cause episcleritis or scleritis) and others.
 Others: Rosacea, atopy, collagen vascular

diseases, gout, and thyroid disease.

Work-Up
1. History: Assess for a history of rash, arthritis, venereal disease, recent viral illness,
other medical problems.
2. External examination in natural light: Look
for the bluish hue of scleritis.
3. Slit-lamp examination: Anesthetize (e.g.,
topical proparacaine) and move the conjunctiva with a cotton-tipped applicator to
determine the depth of the injected blood
vessels. Evaluate for any corneal or anterior
chamber involvement. Check IOP.
4. Place a drop of phenylephrine 2.5% in the
affected eye and reexamine the vascular

5.7

5. If the history suggests an underlying etiology, or in cases with multiple recurrences,
the appropriate laboratory tests should be
obtained [e.g., antinuclear antibody (ANA),
rheumatoid factor, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), serum uric acid level, RPR,
FTA-ABS, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)].

Treatment
1. If mild, treat with artificial tears q.i.d.
2. If moderate to severe, a mild topical steroid (e.g., fluorometholone 0.1% or
loteprednol 0.5% q.i.d.) often relieves the
discomfort. Occasionally, more potent or
frequent topical steroid application is necessary.
3. Oral NSAIDs may be used as an alternate
steroid-sparing initial therapy (e.g., ibuprofen 200 to 600 mg p.o. t.i.d. to q.i.d., or
naproxen 250 to 500 mg p.o. b.i.d. with
food or antacids).
NOTE: Many physicians prefer oral NSAIDs to
topical steroids as initial therapy.

Follow-Up
Patients treated with artificial tears need not
be seen for several weeks unless discomfort
worsens or persists. If topical steroids are used,
recheck every 2 to 3 weeks until symptoms
resolve. The frequency of steroid administration is then tapered. Patients are informed
that episcleritis may recur in the same or contralateral eye.

More acute onset than scleritis. Patients
tend to be younger and have very mild
symptoms, if any. See 5.6, Episcleritis.

Etiology
Fifty percent of patients with scleritis have an
associated systemic disease. Work-up indicated
if no known underlying disease is present.
More Common. Connective tissue disease
(e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, Wegener granulomatosis, relapsing polychondritis, systemic
lupus erythematosus, reactive arthritis, polyarteritis nodosa, ankylosing spondylitis, inflammatory bowel disease), herpes zoster ophthalmicus, syphilis, status-post ocular surgery, gout.

4. Necrotizing anterior scleritis without
inflammation (scleromalacia perforans):
Typically asymptomatic. Seen most often
in long-standing rheumatoid arthritis.
5. Posterior scleritis: May start posteriorly, or
rarely be an extension of anterior scleritis,
or simulate an amelanotic choroidal mass.
Associated with exudative retinal detachment, disc swelling, retinal hemorrhage,
choroidal folds, choroidal detachment,
restricted motility, proptosis, pain, tenderness. Usually unrelated to systemic disease.

Work-Up
1. History: Previous episodes? Medical problems?

Less Common. Tuberculosis, other bacteria
(e.g., Pseudomonas species with scleral ulceration, Proteus species associated with scleral
buckle), Lyme disease, sarcoidosis, hypertension, foreign body, parasite.

Classification
1. Diffuse anterior scleritis: Widespread
inflammation of the anterior segment.
2. Nodular anterior scleritis: Immovable
inflamed nodule(s) (see Figure 5.7.1).
3. Necrotizing anterior scleritis with inflammation (see Figure 5.7.2): Extreme pain.

2. Examine the sclera in all directions of gaze
by gross inspection in natural light or adequate room light.
3. Slit-lamp examination with a red-free filter
(green light) to determine whether avascular areas of the sclera exist. Check for corneal or anterior chamber involvement.
4. Dilated fundus examination to rule out
posterior involvement.

steroid. If unsuccessful, consider immunosuppressive therapy.
—Immunosuppressive therapy (e.g., cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, cyclosporine, azathioprine, anti-TNFα agents): If
one drug is ineffective or not tolerated,
additional agents should be tried. Systemic steroids may be used in conjunction.
Immunosuppressive therapy should be
coordinated with an internist or a rheumatologist. The role of topical cyclosporine
drops is unclear.
2. Necrotizing scleritis:

6. Complete blood count, ESR, uric acid, RPR,
FTA-ABS, rheumatoid factor, ANA, fasting
blood sugar, ACE, CH 50 (total complement activity assay), C3, C4, and serum
ANCA.

—Systemic steroid and immunosuppressive therapies are used as above.

7. Other tests if clinical suspicion warrants
additional work-up: PPD with anergy
panel, chest radiograph, radiograph of sacroiliac joints, B-scan ultrasonography to
detect posterior scleritis (e.g., T-sign), and
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomographic (CT) scan if indicated.

3. Posterior scleritis: Therapy is controversial
and may include systemic aspirin, NSAIDs,
steroids, or immunosuppressive therapy as
described previously. Consult a retina specialist.

Treatment
1. Diffuse and nodular scleritis: One or more
of the following may be required. Concurrent antacid or histamine type 2 receptor
blocker (e.g., ranitidine 150 mg p.o. b.i.d.)
is advisable.
—NSAIDs (e.g., ibuprofen 400 to 600 mg
p.o. q.i.d.; naproxen 250 to 500 mg p.o.
b.i.d.; indomethacin 25 mg p.o. t.i.d.):
Three separate NSAIDs may be tried
before therapy is considered a failure. If
still no improvement, consider systemic
steroids.
—Systemic steroids: Prednisone 60 to
100 mg p.o. q.d. for 1 week, followed by
a taper to 20 mg q.d. over the next 2 to 6
weeks, followed by a slower taper. An oral
NSAID often facilitates the tapering of the

LWBK1000-C05_p110-134.indd 124

—Scleral patch grafting may be necessary if
there is significant risk of perforation.

4. Infectious etiologies: Treat with appropriate
topical and systemic antimicrobials. Oral
fluoroquinolones have good tissue penetration. If a foreign body [e.g., scleral buckle
(associated with Proteus)] is present, surgical
removal is indicated.
5. Glasses or eye shield should be worn at all
times if there is significant thinning and
perforation risk.
NOTE: Topical steroids are not effective in scleritis. Although controversial, periocular steroids
are usually contraindicated, especially in necrotizing scleritis, and may lead to scleral thinning
and perforation.

Follow-Up
Depends on the severity of the symptoms
and the degree of scleral thinning. Decreased
pain is a sign of response to treatment, even if
inflammation appears unchanged.

BLEPHARITIS/MEIBOMITIS

Symptoms
Itching, burning, mild pain, foreign body sensation, tearing, and crusting around the eyes on
awakening. This is in contrast to dry-eye syndrome in which, symptoms are usually worse
later in the day.

Signs
Critical. Crusty, red, thickened eyelid margins with prominent blood vessels (see Figure
5.8.1) or inspissated oil glands at the eyelid
margins (see Figure 5.8.2).
Other. Conjunctival injection, swollen eyelids, mild mucous discharge, and SPK. Rosacea
may be present. Corneal infiltrates and phlyctenules may be present.

Differential Diagnosis
 Pediculosis. See 5.1, Acute Conjunctivitis.

Treatment
See 5.9, Ocular Rosacea, for treatment options
in the presence of acne rosacea.
1. Scrub the eyelid margins twice a day with a
commercial eyelid scrub or mild shampoo
on a wash cloth.
2. Warm compresses for 10 to 15 minutes
b.i.d. to q.i.d.

3. If associated with dry eyes, use artificial
tears four to eight times per day.
4. If moderately severe, add erythromycin
ointment or azithromycin gel to the eyelids
q.h.s.
5. Consider cyclosporine 0.05% drops b.i.d.,
especially for meibomitis.
6. Unresponsive meibomitis can be treated
with tetracycline 250 mg p.o. q.i.d. or doxycycline 100 mg p.o. q.d. for 1 to 2 weeks,
then taper slowly to one-fourth full dose
for 3 to 6 months.

NOTE: Tetracycline and doxycycline should not
be used in pregnant women, nursing mothers,
or children ≤8 years. Erythromycin 200 mg p.o.
b.i.d. can be used instead.

Follow-Up
Three to four weeks. Eyelid scrubs and warm
compresses may be reduced to q.d. as the condition improves. They often need to be maintained indefinitely.
NOTE: Rarely, intractable, unilateral, or asymmetric

OCULAR ROSACEA

Symptoms

Treatment

Bilateral chronic ocular irritation, redness,
burning, photophobia, and foreign body sensation. Typically middle-aged adults, but it
can be found in children. More common in
women.

1. Warm compresses and eyelid hygiene for
blepharitis or meibomitis (see 5.8, Blepharitis/
Meibomitis). Treat dry eyes if present (see
4.3, Dry-Eye Syndrome).

Signs

5

Critical. Telangiectasias, pustules, papules,
or erythema of the cheeks, forehead, and
nose. Findings may be subtle, often best seen
in natural light. Superficial or deep corneal
vascularization, particularly in the inferior
cornea, is sometimes seen and may extend
into a stromal infiltrate.
Other. Rhinophyma of the nose occurs in
the late stages of the disease, especially in
men. Blepharitis (telangiectasias of the eyelid margin with inflammation) and a history of chalazia are common. Conjunctival
injection, SPK, phlyctenules, perilimbal
infiltrates of staphylococcal hypersensitivity, iritis, or even corneal perforation may
occur.

Differential Diagnosis
 Herpes simplex keratitis: Usually unilateral.

Stromal keratitis with neovascularization
may appear similar. See 4.15, Herpes Simplex
Virus.
 See 4.1, Superficial Punctate Keratopathy, for

additional differential diagnoses.

Etiology
Unknown, but signs and symptoms are often
induced by certain environmental/local factors, including coffee, tea, and alcohol.

Work-Up

2. Avoidance of exacerbating foods, beverages, and environmental factors.
3. Tetracycline 250 mg p.o. q.i.d. or doxycycline 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. for 1 to 2 weeks
then daily; taper the dose slowly once
relief from symptoms is obtained. Some
patients are maintained on low-dose tetracycline (e.g., 250 mg p.o. q.d.) or doxycycline (e.g., 40 to 100 mg p.o. q.d. or less
than daily) indefinitely, if active disease
recurs when the patient is off medication.
Erythromycin 250 mg q.i.d. may be substituted if tetracycline or doxycycline is contraindicated.

NOTE: Tetracycline and doxycycline should not
be given to pregnant women, nursing women,
or children ≤8 years. Patients should be told to
take the tetracycline on an empty stomach and
should be warned of susceptibility to sunburn
while taking tetracycline and doxycycline.

NOTE: Asymptomatic ocular rosacea without
progressively worsening eye disease does not require oral antibiotics.

4. Facial lesions can be treated with metronidazole gel (0.75%) application b.i.d.
5. Treat chalazia as needed (see 6.2, Chalazion/
Hordeolum).

1. External examination: Look at the face for
the characteristic skin findings.

6. Cyclosporine 0.05% drops b.i.d. is often
helpful for chronic rosacea-related ocular
and eyelid inflammation.

2. Slit-lamp examination: Look for telangiectasias and meibomitis on the eyelids, conjunctival injection, and corneal scarring
and vascularization.

7. Corneal perforations may be treated with
cyanoacrylate tissue adhesive if small,
whereas larger perforations may require
surgical correction. Tetracycline is usually

LWBK1000-C05_p110-134.indd 126

5.10

given for treatment of underlying blepharitis and for its antimelting properties.
8. If infiltrates stain with fluorescein, an infectious corneal ulcer may be present. Smears,
cultures, and antibiotic treatment may be
necessary. See 4.11, Bacterial Keratitis, and
Appendix 8, Corneal Culture Procedure.

Ocular Cicatricial Pemphigoid

127

Follow-Up
Variable; depends on the severity of disease.
Patients without corneal involvement are seen
weeks to months later. Those with corneal disease are examined more often. Patients with
moderate-to-severe facial disease should also
seek dermatologic consultation.

OCULAR CICATRICIAL PEMPHIGOID

Symptoms
Insidious onset of dryness, redness, foreign
body sensation, tearing, and photophobia.
Bilateral involvement. The course is characterized by remissions and exacerbations. Usually
occurs in patients older than 55 years.

Signs
(See Figure 5.10.1.)
Critical. Inferior
symblepharon
(linear
folds of conjunctiva connecting the palpebral
conjunctiva of the lower eyelid to the inferior bulbar conjunctiva), foreshortening, and
tightness of the lower fornix.
Other. Secondary bacterial conjunctivitis,
SPK, corneal ulcer. Later, poor tear film, resulting in severe dry-eye syndrome; entropion;
trichiasis (if present, carefully examine fornices for symblepharon); corneal opacification
with pannus and keratinization; obliteration

of the fornices, with eventual limitation of
ocular motility; and ankyloblepharon may
occur.

5

Systemic. Mucous membrane (e.g., oropharynx, esophagus, anus, vagina, urethra) vesicles;
scarring or strictures; ruptured or formed bullae; denuded epithelium. Desquamative gingivitis is common. Cutaneous vesicles and bullae may occur, sometimes with erythematous
plaques or scars near affected mucous membranes.

Differential Diagnosis
 Stevens–Johnson

syndrome (erythema
multiforme major) and toxic epidermal
necrolysis (TEN): Acute onset, but similar
ocular involvement as ocular pemphigoid.
Often precipitated by drugs (e.g., sulfa,
penicillin, other antibiotics, phenytoin) or
infections (e.g., herpes and mycoplasma).
See 13.6, Stevens–Johnson Syndrome (Erythema
Multiforme Major).

 History

of membranous conjunctivitis
with scarring: Usually adenovirus or betahemolytic Streptococcus. Symblepharon can
follow any severe membranous/pseudomembranous conjunctivitis. See 5.1, Acute Conjunctivitis and 5.2, Chronic Conjunctivitis.

 Severe chemical burn: See 3.1, Chemical

Burn.
 Chronic topical medicine: e.g., glaucoma

medications (especially pilocarpine and
phospholine iodide), antiviral agents.

Conjunctiva/Sclera/Iris/External Disease

Work-Up
1. History: Long-term topical medications?
Acute onset of severe systemic illness in the
past? Recent systemic medications?
2. Skin and mucous membrane examination.
3. Slit-lamp examination: Especially for
inferior symblepharon, by pulling down
the lower eyelid during upgaze. Check
IOP.

5

4. Gram stain and culture of the cornea or
conjunctiva if secondary bacterial infection
is suspected. See Appendix 8, Corneal Culture Procedure.
5. Consider a biopsy of the conjunctiva or
other involved mucous membrane for
direct immunofluorescence studies, or indirect immunofluorescence for the presence
of antibodies.
6. Obtain appropriate consults, as below.

Treatment
Multidisciplinary approach often needed,
including dermatology, oculoplastics, cornea, otolaryngology, gastroenterology, and
pulmonology. Early diagnosis of the ocular
involvement is critical for optimal management.
1. Preservative-free artificial tears four to ten
times per day. Can add an artificial tear
ointment b.i.d. to q.i.d. and q.h.s.
2. Treat blepharitis vigorously with eyelid
hygiene, warm compresses, and antibiotic
ointment (e.g., erythromycin t.i.d.). Oral
tetracycline/doxycycline can be used if
blepharitis is present (particularly given
its anti-inflammatory properties). See 5.8,
Blepharitis/Meibomitis.
3. Goggles or glasses with sides to provide a
moist environment for the eyes.
4. Punctal occlusion if puncta are not already
closed by scarring.

LWBK1000-C05_p110-134.indd 128

5. Topical steroids may rarely help in suppressing acute exacerbations, but be cautious of corneal melting.
6. Systemic steroids (e.g., prednisone 60 mg
p.o. q.d.) may also help in suppressing acute
exacerbations but are most effective when
used with other immune modulators.
7. Immunosuppressive agents (e.g., mycophenolate mofetil, methotrexate, or cyclophosphamide) are typically used for progressive disease.
8. Dapsone is occasionally used for progressive disease. Starting dose is 25 mg p.o. for
3 to 7 days; increase by 25 mg every 4 to
7 days until the desired result is achieved
(usually 100 to 150 mg p.o. q.d.). Dapsone is
maintained for several months and tapered
slowly.
NOTE: Dapsone can cause a dose-related hemolysis. A complete blood count and glucose6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G-6-PD) must be
checked before administration. Dapsone should
be avoided in patients with G-6-PD deficiency.
A complete blood count with reticulocyte count
is obtained weekly as the dose is increased every
3 to 4 weeks until blood counts are stable and
then every few months.

9. Consider surgical correction of entropion
and cryotherapy or electrolysis of trichiasis. Surgery carries risk of further scarring
and is best performed when inflammation
is absent.
10. Mucous membrane grafts (e.g., buccal or
amniotic membrane graft) can be used to
reconstruct the fornices if needed.
11. Consider a keratoprosthesis in an endstage eye with good macular and optic
nerve function if the inflammation and
IOP are controlled.

Follow-Up
Every 1 to 2 weeks during acute exacerbations,
and every 1 to 6 months during remissions.

CONJUNCTIVAL TUMORS

The following are the most common and
important conjunctival tumors. Phlyctenulosis and Pterygium/Pinguecula are discussed in
4.20 and 4.9, respectively.

AMELANOTIC LESIONS
Limbal Dermoid
Congenital benign tumor, usually located in
the inferotemporal quadrant of the limbus,

LWBK1000-C05_p110-134.indd 129

can involve the cornea. Lesions are white,
solid, fairly well circumscribed, elevated, and
can have hair arising from their surface. May
enlarge, particularly at puberty. Associated
with eyelid colobomas, preauricular skin tags,
and vertebral abnormalities (Goldenhar syndrome). Surgical removal may be performed
for cosmetic purposes or if they are affecting the visual axis, although a white corneal
scar may persist postoperatively and cause

biomicroscopy may be helpful to determine depth.

embedded foreign body, sarcoidosis, tuberculosis, or another granulomatous disease. For
systemic granulomatous diseases (e.g., sarcoidosis), conjunctival granulomas can be an
excellent source of tissue. Management often
includes a course of topical corticosteroids or
excisional biopsy.

Papilloma
Dermolipoma

5

Congenital benign tumor, usually occurring
under the bulbar conjunctiva temporally, often
superotemporally. Yellow-white, solid tumor.
Can have hair arising from its surface. High
association with Goldenhar syndrome. Surgical
removal is avoided because of the frequent posterior extension of this tumor into the orbit. If
necessary, partial resection of the anterior portion can usually be done without difficulty.

Pyogenic Granuloma
Benign, deep-red, pedunculated mass. Typically
develops at a site of prior surgery, trauma, or chalazion. This lesion consists of exuberant granulation tissue. May respond to topical steroids.
A topical steroid–antibiotic combination (e.g.,
dexamethasone/tobramycin 0.1%/0.3% q.i.d.
for 1 to 2 weeks) can be helpful because infection
can be present. Excision required if it persists.

1. Viral: Frequently multiple pedunculated or
sessile lesions in children and young adults.
May occur on palpebral or bulbar conjunctiva. They are benign and are usually left
untreated because of their high recurrence
rate (which is often multiple) and their
tendency for spontaneous resolution. They
can also be treated with oral cimetidine
30 mg/kg/day in children or 150 mg p.o.
b.i.d. in adults, because of the drug’s
immune-stimulating properties.
2. Nonviral: Typically, a single sessile or pedunculated lesion found in older patients. These
are located more commonly near the limbus
and can represent precancerous lesions with
malignant potential. Complete wide excisional biopsy with cryotherapy at the conjunctival margin is the preferred treatment
since it may be difficult to differentiate from
squamous cell carcinoma.

Lymphangioma
Probably congenital but often not detected
until years after birth. Slowly progressive benign
lesion that appears as a diffuse, multiloculated,
cystic mass. Seen most commonly between birth
and young adulthood, often before 6 years of
age. Hemorrhage into the cystic spaces can produce a “chocolate cyst.” Can enlarge, sometimes
due to an upper respiratory tract infection. Concomitant eyelid, orbital, facial, nasal, or oropharyngeal lymphangiomas can be present. Surgical
excision may be performed for cosmetic or functional purposes, but it often must be repeated
because it is difficult to remove the entire tumor
with one surgical procedure. Lesions often stabilize in early adulthood. These lesions do not
regress like the capillary hemangiomas.

Granuloma
Can occur at any age, predominantly on the
tarsal conjunctiva. No distinct clinical appearance, but patients can have an associated

LWBK1000-C05_p110-134.indd 130

NOTE: In dark-skinned individuals, papillomas can
appear pigmented and can be mistaken for malignant melanoma.

Kaposi Sarcoma
Malignant, nontender subconjunctival nodule, usually red. May simulate a conjunctival
hemorrhage. Perform HIV/AIDS testing. Kaposi
sarcoma lesions may resolve when patients are
placed on highly active antiretroviral therapy
(HAART). Other treatments include vinblastine,
vincristine, excision, cryotherapy, or irradiation.

Conjunctival Intraepithelial Neoplasia
(Dysplasia and Carcinoma in Situ)
Typically occurs in middle-aged to elderly people.
Leukoplakic or gray-white, gelatinous lesion that
usually begins at the limbus. Occasionally, a papillomatous, fernlike appearance develops. Usually
unilateral and unifocal. Can evolve into invasive

squamous cell carcinoma (see Figure 5.12.1) if
not treated early and successfully. Can spread
over the cornea or, less commonly, invade the
eye or metastasize. Preferred treatment is a complete excisional biopsy followed by supplemental
cryotherapy to the remaining adjacent conjunctiva. Excision may require lamellar dissection
into the corneal stroma and sclera in recurrent
or long-standing lesions. Topical forms of mitomycin C, 5-fluorouracil, and interferon have also
been used. Periodic follow-up examinations are
required to detect recurrences.

Lymphoid Tumors (Range from Benign Reactive
Lymphoid Hyperplasia to Lymphoma)
Can occur in young- to middle-aged adults,
but mean age of diagnosis is 61 years. Usually
appears as a light pink, salmon-colored lesion.
Can appear in the bulbar conjunctiva, where
it is typically oval, or in the fornix, where it is
usually horizontal, conforming to the contour
of the fornix (see Figure 5.12.2). Excisional or
incisional biopsy is performed for immunohistochemical studies (require fresh non-fixed
tissue). Symptomatic benign reactive lymphoid hyperplasia can be treated by excisional
biopsy or topical steroid drops. Lymphomas
should be completely excised when possible,
without damage to the extraocular muscles or
excessive sacrifice of conjunctiva. If not possible, an incisional biopsy is justified. Refer to
an internist or oncologist for systemic evaluation. Systemic lymphoma may develop, if it is
not already present.

LWBK1000-C05_p110-134.indd 131

Epibulbar Osseous Choristoma
Congenital, benign, hard, bony mass, usually
on the superotemporal bulbar conjunctiva.
Surgical removal can be performed for cosmetic purposes.

5

Amyloid
(See Figure 5.12.3.)
Smooth, waxy, yellow-pink masses seen especially in the lower fornix when the conjunctiva is involved. Often there are associated
small hemorrhages. Definitive diagnosis is
made with biopsy. Consider work-up for systemic amyloidosis, although most cases in the
conjunctiva are localized and solitary.

Amelanotic Melanoma
Pigmentation of conjunctival melanoma is
variable. Look for bulbar or limbal lesions
with significant vascularity to help make this
difficult diagnosis.

Sebaceous Carcinoma
Although usually involving the palpebral conjunctiva, this tumor can involve the bulbar

FIGURE 5.12.3.

conjunctiva (when there is pagetoid invasion
of the conjunctiva). This diagnosis should
always be considered in older patients with
refractory unilateral blepharoconjunctivitis.
(See 6.11, Malignant Tumors of the Eyelid, for
a detailed discussion of sebaceous carcinoma.)

MELANOTIC LESIONS
Nevus

5

(See Figure 5.12.4.)
Commonly develops during puberty, most
often within the palpebral fissure on the bulbar conjunctiva. Usually well demarcated with
variable pigmentation. The degree of pigmentation can also change with time. A key sign in
the diagnosis is the presence of small cysts in
the lesion. Benign nevi can enlarge; however,
a melanoma can occasionally develop from a
nevus, and enlargement can be an early sign
of malignant transformation. Nevi of the
palpebral conjunctiva are rare, and primary
acquired melanosis and malignant melanoma
must be considered in such lesions. A baseline
photograph of the nevus should be taken,
and the patient should be observed every 6 to
12 months. Surgical excision is elective. Nevi
may be amelanotic.

Ocular or Oculodermal Melanocytosis
Congenital episcleral (not conjunctival) lesion,
as demonstrated (after topical anesthesia) by
moving the conjunctiva back and forth over
the area of pigmentation with a cotton-tipped

FIGURE 5.12.4.

Conjunctival nevus.

LWBK1000-C05_p110-134.indd 132

swab (conjunctival pigmentation will move
with the conjunctiva). Typically, the lesion
is unilateral, blue-gray, and often accompanied by a darker ipsilateral iris and choroid.
In oculodermal melanocytosis, also called
nevus of Ota, the periocular skin is also pigmented. These lesions can become pigmented
at puberty. Both conditions predispose to melanoma of the uveal tract, orbit, and brain (most
commonly in whites) and glaucoma.

Primary Acquired Melanosis
Flat, brown patches of pigmentation, without
cysts, in the conjunctiva. Usually arise during
or after middle age and almost always occur
in whites. Classically, approximately 30% of
these lesions develop into melanoma. More
recent studies suggest the true incidence is
much lower. Malignant transformation should
be suspected when an elevation or increase
in vascularity in one of these areas develops.
Management options include careful observation with photographic comparison for any
change and incisional or excisional biopsy followed by cryotherapy for suggestive lesions.

Malignant Melanoma
(See Figure 5.12.5.)
Typically occurs in middle-aged to elderly
patients. The lesion is a nodular brown mass.
Well vascularized. Often a large conjunctival
feeding vessel present. May develop de novo,
from a nevus, or from primary acquired melanosis. Check for an underlying ciliary body

melanoma (dilated fundus examination, transillumination, and ultrasonographic biomicroscopy). Intraocular and orbital extension can
occur. Excisional biopsy (often with supplemental cryotherapy) is performed unless intraocular or orbital involvement is present. In
advanced cases, orbital exenteration is necessary. Sentinel lymph node biopsy is advised to
detect early metastatic disease.

MALIGNANT MELANOMA OF THE IRIS

Malignant melanoma of the iris can occur as a
localized or diffuse pigmented (melanotic) or
nonpigmented (amelanotic) lesion.

Signs
(See Figure 5.13.1.)
Critical. Unilateral brown or translucent iris
mass lesion exhibiting slow growth. It is more
common in the inferior half of the iris and in
light-skinned individuals. Rare in blacks.
Other.
A localized melanoma is usually
>3 mm in diameter at the base and >1 mm in
depth with a variable prominent feeder vessel. Can produce a sector cortical cataract,
ectropion iridis, spontaneous hyphema,

seeding of tumor cells into the anterior
chamber, or direct invasion of tumor into
the trabecular meshwork and secondary
glaucoma. A diffuse melanoma causes progressive darkening of the involved iris, loss
of iris crypts, and increased IOP. Focal iris
nodules can be present.

Differential Diagnosis
Melanotic Masses
 Nevi: Typically become clinically apparent at puberty, usually flat or minimally
elevated (i.e., <1 mm) and uncommonly
exceed 3 mm in diameter. Can cause
ectropion iridis, sector cortical cataract,
or secondary glaucoma. Usually not vascular. More common in the inferior half
of the iris. Nevi do not usually grow.
 Tumors of the iris pigment epithelium:

Usually black in contrast to melanomas,
which are often brown or amelanotic.

Amelanotic Masses
 Metastasis: Grows rapidly. More likely to

FIGURE 5.13.1. Iris melanoma.

be multiple or bilateral than is melanoma.
Frequently liberates cells and produces a
pseudohypopyon. Involves the superior
and inferior halves of the iris equally.

the iris pigment epithelium or within the
iris stroma. Each with very different clinical
features.
 Inflammatory granuloma: Sarcoidosis, tuber-

culosis, juvenile xanthogranuloma, others.
Often have other signs of inflammation such
as keratic precipitates, synechiae, and posterior subcapsular cataracts. A history of iritis
or a systemic inflammatory disease may be
elicited. See Chapter 12, Uveitis.
Diffuse Lesions
 Congenital iris heterochromia: The darker

iris is present at birth or in early childhood.
It is nonprogressive and usually is not associated with glaucoma. The iris has a smooth
appearance.
 Fuchs heterochromic iridocyclitis: Asymme-

try of iris color, mild iritis in the eye with the
lighter-colored iris, usually unilateral. Often
associated with a cataract or glaucoma. See
12.1, Anterior Uveitis (Iritis/Iridocyclitis).
 Iris

nevus syndrome: Corneal edema,
peripheral anterior synechiae, iris atrophy,
or an irregular pupil can be present along
with multiple iris nodules and glaucoma.

 Pigment dispersion: Usually bilateral. The

iris is rarely heavily pigmented (although
the trabecular meshwork can be), and iris
transillumination defects are often present.
See 9.10, Pigment Dispersion Syndrome/Pigmentary Glaucoma.
 Hemosiderosis: A dark iris can result after

body.

Work-Up
1. History: Previous cancer, ocular surgery, or
trauma? Weight loss? Anorexia?
2. Slit-lamp examination: Carefully evaluate
the irides. Check IOP.
3. Gonioscopy.
4. Dilated fundus examination using indirect
ophthalmoscopy.
5. Transillumination of iris mass (helps differentiate epithelial cysts that transmit light
from pigmented lesions that do not).
6. Photograph the lesion and accurately draw
it in the chart, including dimensions. Ultrasonographic biomicroscopy and anterior
segment optical coherence tomography
can be helpful.

Treatment/Follow-Up
1. Observe the patient with periodic examinations and photographs every 3 to 12
months, depending on the suspicion of
malignancy.
2. Surgical resection is indicated if growth
is documented, the tumor interferes with
vision, or it produces intractable glaucoma.
3. Diffuse iris melanoma with secondary glaucoma may require enucleation.
NOTE: Avoid filtering surgery for glaucoma associated with possible melanoma because of the risk of
tumor dissemination.

Drooping upper eyelid.

Other. Concerning associated signs include
anisocoria, diplopia, ocular motility defecits,
headache, or neck pain. See individual entities.

Etiology
NOTE: Although the vast majority of ptosis is of
benign etiology, five entities must be ruled out in
every single case by careful examination.

1. Horner syndrome.
2. Third cranial nerve (CN) palsy (complete,
partial, or aberrant CN III regeneration).
3. Myasthenia gravis.
4. Superior eyelid or orbital malignancy.

indicate a double elevator palsy. Acquired
myogenic ptosis is uncommon and may be
seen with muscular dystrophy and CPEO.
• Aponeurotic: This is characterized by a
high or absent eyelid crease, moderate
degree of ptosis, good levator function
(10 to 15 mm). May worsen in downgaze.
Levator stretching or dehiscence can be
due to normal aging, repetitive eye rubbing, use of rigid contact lenses, or previous intraocular surgery.
• Neurogenic: Third cranial nerve palsy
(often complete ptosis, never an isolated
abnormality; congenital, compressive,
vasculopathic, see 10.5, Isolated Third
Nerve Palsy); Horner syndrome (subtle
upper and lower eyelid ptosis, see 10.2,
Horner Syndrome); myasthenia gravis (variable ptosis, worsens with fatigue, see
10.11, Myasthenia Gravis); Marcus Gunn
jaw-winking syndrome (ptotic eyelid
elevates with jaw movement); ophthalmoplegic migraine; multiple sclerosis.

5. Chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia (CPEO) (particularly Kearns–Sayre
syndrome. See 10.12, Chronic Progressive
External Ophthalmoplegia).
• Myogenic: Congenital myogenic ptosis
is present at birth with poor levator function and a poor or absent lid crease due to
dysgenesis of the levator muscle, fibrosis,
and its replacement with adipose tissue.
A poor Bell phenomenon, lagophthalmos
in downgaze, and upgaze limitation may

Eyelid

• Mechanical: Retained contact lens in
upper fornix; upper eyelid inflammation
(chalazion, giant papillary conjunctivitis,
posttraumatic or postsurgical edema) or
neoplasm.
• Traumatic: History of eyelid laceration
with levator transection, contusion injury
to the levator, tethering or ischemia
within an orbital roof fracture, late dehiscence or cicatricial changes.
• Pseudoptosis: Contralateral eyelid retraction or proptosis, ipsilateral enophthalmos,
hypertropia, microphthalmia, phthisis
bulbi, dermatochalasis, brow ptosis, chalazion or other eyelid tumor, eyelid edema,
blepharospasm, Duane syndrome.

6

Work-Up
1. History: Determine the onset and duration
of ptosis. Present since birth? Acute onset?
Old photographs (e.g., driver's license)
and family members’ opinions are useful
adjuncts to the history. History of surgery
in either eye? Orbital or eyelid trauma
(orbital blow-out fractures resulting in
enophthalmos can mimic ptosis)? Variability with fatigue? Associated with headache
or neck pain? Any history of autoimmune
disease (lupus, Sjogren syndrome) or corneal
abnormalities (may predispose the patient
to postoperative exposure keratopathy)?
2. Mandatory documentation: Must carefully check and document pupillary size
and extraocular motility, even if normal. If
anisocoria is present, measurements should
be documented under light and dark conditions. Additional pharmacologic testing
may be indicated (see 10.1, Anisocoria). If
extraocular muscle dysfunction is noted,
additional testing with prism bars may be
indicated.
3. Complete orbital examination of both
eyes: Measure and compare margin–reflex
distance, levator function (full upper eyelid excursion while preventing frontalis
muscle assistance), upper eyelid crease position of both eyes. Is there lagophthalmos?
Associated lower eyelid “ptosis” (elevation
of ipsilateral lower eyelid) is often seen in

LWBK1000-C06_p135-152.indd 136

Horner syndrome. Proptosis or eyelid lag
may masquerade as contralateral ptosis.
Exophthalmometry measurements are useful. Any sign of aberrant eyelid movements
like jaw-winking, variability and/or fatigue,
orbicularis weakness, eyelid retraction with
adduction and/or infraduction? Palpate the
superior orbit to rule out a mass or superior
orbital rim deformity.
4. Complete ocular examination: Determine if
there are associated pupillary or extraocular
motility abnormalities. Flip upper eyelid to
examine conjunctival surface and superior
fornix. Dilated fundus examination to look
for pigmentary changes in adolescents and
young adults who present with ptosis, poor
levator function, and external ophthalmoplegia (possible Kearns–Sayre syndrome).
5. Corneal protective mechanisms. Document
the presence or absence of preoperative
lagophthalmos, orbicularis function, Bell
phenomenon, and tear production. Check
the cornea carefully for any abnormalities
or dystrophies, which may predispose the
patient to postoperative keratopathy.
6. Other tests
—Ice test: Apply ice pack to ptotic eye for
2 minutes and reassess the degree of ptosis.
Improvement with ice is highly suggestive
of myasthenia gravis.
—Neosynephrine test: Instill one drop of
2.5% phenylephrine in the ptotic eye(s) and
reassess the degree of ptosis. Patients with
improvement of ptosis after 5 to 7 minutes
may be good candidates for ptosis correction by an internal approach.
—Cocaine, apraclonidine, and hydroxyamphetamine tests. See 10.2, Horner Syndrome.
7. Imaging studies: In very select cases where
a systemic or neurologic cause is suspected:
—Computed tomography (CT) or magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) of orbit if a superior orbital mass is suspected.
—Emergent CT/computed tomography
angiogram (CTA) or MRI/magnetic resonance angiogram (MRA) of the head and

neck if carotid artery dissection is suspected in a patient with a painful Horner
syndrome. Imaging of the head alone is
inadequate. See 10.2, Horner Syndrome.
—Emergent CT/CTA, MRI/MRA, or conventional angiography if intracranial aneurysm causing a third cranial nerve palsy
with pupillary involvement or a partial
third cranial nerve palsy is suspected. See
10.5, Isolated Third Nerve Palsy.
—Chest CT if myasthenia gravis is suspected to rule out thymoma. See 10.11,
Myasthenia Gravis.
8. Ancillary studies:
—Urgent ECG and cardiology consult if
Kearns–Sayre syndrome is suspected. These
patients can have heart block, resulting in
sudden death.
—If myasthenia gravis is suspected, acetylcholine receptor antibody testing, singlefiber electromyography (including the
orbicularis muscle), and/or edrophonium
chloride testing under monitored conditions may be indicated. See 10.11, Myasthenia Gravis.
—If severe dry eye is found, consider an
autoimmune work-up to rule out lupus and
Sjogren syndrome.

Treatment
1. Depends on the underlying etiology (see
10.2, Horner Syndrome; 10.5, Isolated Third
Nerve Palsy; 10.11, Myasthenia Gravis).

Chalazion/Hordeolum

137

2. Nonsurgical options: Observation. Taping
upper lids open and eyelid crutches attached
to glasses in neurogenic and myogenic ptosis. Management of chalazion with warm
compresses and/or excision, eyelid and/or
orbital neoplasms with excision.
3. Surgical options: Transcutaneous levator
advancement, transconjunctival levator
advancement, frontalis muscle suspension,
Müller muscle resection. Surgical approach
depends on preoperative evaluation and
the underlying etiology of ptosis.

Follow-Up
1. Congenital: Close follow-up is required to
monitor for the presence of amblyopia,
caused either by occlusion or by refractive
error secondary to induced corneal astigmatism, abnormal head positioning, and
exposure keratopathy.
2. Traumatic: Observation for 6 months before
considering surgical intervention.
3. Neurologic: Reevaluate based on particular
entity.
4. Postoperative (after ptosis repair).
Acute: Monitor for infection and hemorrhage.
Subacute: Monitor for exposure keratopathy and for asymmetry that may require
postoperative readjustment. Mild lagophthalmos is common for 2 to 3 weeks after
surgical repair and usually resolves.
Chronic: Monitor for ptosis recurrence and
exposure keratopathy.

CHALAZION/HORDEOLUM

Signs

Other. Blocked meibomian orifice, eyelid
swelling and erythema, localized eyelid tenderness, associated blepharitis or acne rosacea.
May also note “pointing” of mucopurulent
material.

(See Figure 6.2.1.)

Definitions

Critical. Visible, or palpable, well-defined
subcutaneous nodule in the eyelid. In some
cases, a nodule cannot be identified.

Chalazion: Area of focal inflammation within
the eyelid secondary to the obstruction of a
meibomian gland or gland of Zeis.

Symptoms
Acute or chronic eyelid lump, eyelid swelling,
tenderness.

Eyelid

Treatment
1. Warm compresses for 10 minutes q.i.d. with
light massage over the lesion.
2. Consider a topical antibiotic if lesion is
draining or for associated blepharitis (e.g.,
bacitracin or erythromycin ointment b.i.d.).
Consider systemic therapy with doxycycline 100 mg b.i.d. for its antibacterial and
anti-inflammatory actions.

FIGURE 6.2.1. Chalazion.

Hordeolum: Acute infection; can be external
(stye: abscess of gland of Zeis on lid margin) or
internal (abscess of meibomian gland). Usually involves Staphylococcus species and occasionally evolves into a preseptal cellulitis.

Differential Diagnosis
 Preseptal cellulitis: Eyelid and periorbital

erythema, edema, and warmth. See 6.10,
Preseptal Cellulitis.
 Sebaceous

carcinoma: Suspect in older
patients with recurrent chalazia, eyelid
thickening, or chronic unilateral blepharitis. See 6.11, Malignant Tumors of the Eyelid.

 Pyogenic granuloma: Benign, deep-red, pedun-

culated lesion often associated with chalazia,
hordeola, trauma, or surgery. May be excised
or treated with a topical antibiotic–steroid
combination such as neomycin/polymixin
B/dexamethasone q.i.d. for 1 to 2 weeks.
Intraocular pressure must be monitored if
topical steroids are used.

Work-Up
1. History: Previous ocular surgery or trauma?
Previous chalazia or eyelid lesions?
2. External examination: Palpate the involved
eyelid for a nodule.
3. Slit-lamp examination: Evaluate the meibomian glands for inspissation and evert the
eyelid to rule out other etiologies.

LWBK1000-C06_p135-152.indd 138

3. If a hordeola worsens, consider incision
and drainage and management as per
preseptal cellulitis (see 6.10, Preseptal Cellulitis).
4. If the chalazion fails to resolve after 3 to
4 weeks of appropriate medical therapy and
the patient wishes to have it removed, incision and curettage are performed. Occasionally, an injection of steroid (e.g., 0.2 to
1.0 mL of triamcinolone 40 mg/mL usually
mixed 1:1 with 2% lidocaine with epinephrine) into the lesion is performed instead of
minor surgery, especially if the chalazion is
near the lacrimal apparatus. The total dosage depends on the size of the lesion. All
recurrent or atypical chalazia must be sent
for pathology.
NOTE: A steroid injection can lead to permanent depigmentation or atrophy of the skin at
the injection site. The manufacturer of triamcinolone has recently recommended against its
use intraocularly and in the periocular region.
Vigorous injection can rarely result in retrograde
intraarterial injection with resultant central
retinal artery occlusion. Use of triamcinolone
injection for chalazion treatment must include
a detailed discussion between physician and
patient, as well as adequate documentation in
the patient's record.

Follow-Up
Patients are not seen after instituting medical therapy unless the lesion persists beyond
3 to 4 weeks. Patients who have incision and
curettage are reexamined in 1 week or as
needed.

1. History: Previous surgery, trauma, chemical
burn, or seventh nerve palsy?

Other. Superficial punctate keratopathy (SPK)
from corneal exposure; conjunctival injection, thickening, and eventual keratinization
from chronic conjunctival dryness. Scarring
of skin may be seen in cicatricial cases. Facial
hemiparesis and lagophthalmos may be seen
in paralytic cases.

2. External examination: Check orbicularis
oculi function, look for an eyelid tumor,
eyelid scarring, herniated orbital fat, and
other causes.

Etiology

Treatment

 Involutional: Aging.

1. Treat exposure keratopathy with lubricating agents. See 4.5, Exposure Keratopathy.

 Paralytic: Seventh cranial nerve palsy.
 Cicatricial: Due to chemical burn, surgery,

eyelid laceration scar, skin diseases (e.g.,
eczema, ichthyosis), and others.
 Mechanical: Due to herniated orbital fat,

eyelid tumor, and others.

3. Slit-lamp examination: Check for SPK due
to exposure and evaluate conjunctival
integrity.

6

2. Treat an inflamed, exposed eyelid margin with warm compresses and antibiotic
ointment (e.g., bacitracin or erythromycin
t.i.d.). A short course of combination antibiotic–steroid ointment (e.g., neomycin/
polymixin B/dexamethasone) may be helpful if close follow-up is ensured.
3. Taping the eyelids into position may be a
temporizing measure.
4. Definitive treatment usually requires surgery. Surgery is delayed for 3 to 6 months
in patients with a seventh nerve palsy because the ectropion may resolve spontaneously (see 10.9, Isolated Seventh Nerve Palsy).
Corneal exposure may make repair more
urgent.

Follow-Up

FIGURE 6.3.1. Ectropion.

Treatment
If blepharospasm is present, see 6.7, Blepharospasm.

Etiology
 Involutional: Aging.
 Cicatricial: Due to conjunctival scarring in

ocular cicatricial pemphigoid, Stevens–Johnson syndrome, chemical burns, trauma, trachoma, and others.

1. Antibiotic ointment (e.g., erythromycin or
bacitracin ophthalmic t.i.d.) for SPK.
2. Everting the eyelid margin away from the
globe and taping it in place with adhesive
tape may be a temporizing measure.
3. For spastic entropion, a Quickert suture
placed at the bedside or in the office can
temporarily resolve the eyelid malposition.
4. Surgery is often required for permanent
correction.

Follow-Up
If the cornea is relatively healthy, the condition
does not require urgent attention or follow-up.
If the cornea is significantly damaged, aggressive treatment is indicated (see 4.1, Superficial
Punctate Keratopathy). Follow-up is determined
by the severity of corneal involvement.

 Distichiasis: An aberrant second row of

lashes that emanates from meibomian gland
openings. Most commonly acquired in the
setting of trauma or chronic inflammation
(e.g., blepharitis). Congenital distichiasis is
a rare, sometimes hereditary condition in
which the meibomian glands are replaced by
an extra row of eyelashes.

Etiology

 Cicatricial: Eyelid scarring from trauma, sur-

gery, ocular cicatricial pemphigoid (see 5.10,
Ocular Cicatricial Pemphigoid), trachoma, and
others.

Treatment
1. Epilation: Remove the misdirected lashes.
—A few misdirected lashes: Remove them
at the slit lamp with fine forceps. Recurrence is common.
—Diffuse, severe, or recurrent trichiasis:
Can attempt to epilate as described; definitive therapy usually requires electrolysis,
cryotherapy, radiofrequency epilation, or
eyelid surgery.
2. Treat SPK with antibiotic ointment (e.g.,
erythromycin or bacitracin t.i.d.).

collagen and elastin fibers. The symptoms are
thought to result from spontaneous eversion
of the upper eyelid during sleep, allowing the
superior palpebral conjunctiva to rub against
a pillow or sheets. Unilateral symptoms are
often on the side on which the patient predominantly sleeps.

Work-Up
1. Pull the upper eyelid toward the patient's
forehead to determine if it spontaneously
everts or is abnormally lax.
2. Conduct slit-lamp examination of the
cornea and conjunctiva with fluorescein
staining, looking for upper palpebral conjunctival papillae and SPK.

3. Ask family members whether patient snores
severely or if the patient has a history of
sleep apnea.

Treatment
1. Topical antibiotic ointment for any mild
corneal or conjunctival abnormality (e.g.,

6.7

2. The eyelids may be taped closed during
sleep, or a shield may be worn to protect
the eyelid from rubbing against the pillow
or bed. Patients are asked to refrain from
sleeping face down. Asking patients to sleep
on their contralateral side may be therapeutic as well as diagnostic.
3. Surgical horizontal tightening of the eyelid
is often required for definitive treatment.

Follow-Up
1. Every 2 to 7 days initially and then every few
weeks to months as the condition stabilizes.
2. Refer to an internist, otolaryngologist, or
pulmonologist for evaluation and management of possible obstructive sleep apnea.
Evaluation is important because of the
systemic sequelae of untreated sleep apnea
and for anesthesia risk assessment before
eyelid surgery.

BLEPHAROSPASM

Symptoms
Uncontrolled blinking, twitching, or closure of
the eyelids. Always bilateral, but may briefly be
unilateral at first onset.

Signs
Critical. Bilateral, episodic, involuntary
contractions of the orbicularis oculi muscles.
Other. Disappears during sleep. May have
uncontrolled orofacial, head, and neck movements (Meige syndrome).

Differential Diagnosis
 Hemifacial spasm: Unilateral contractures

of the entire side of the face that do not
disappear during sleep. Usually idiopathic
but may be related to prior cranial nerve
VII palsy, injury at the level of the brainstem, or compression of cranial nerve VII
by a blood vessel or tumor. MRI of the cerebellopontine angle should be obtained in
all patients to rule out tumor. Treatment

tival foreign body, trichiasis, blepharitis,
dry eye).
 Eyelid myokymia: Subtle eyelid twitch

felt by the patient but difficult to observe,
commonly brought on by stress, caffeine,
alcohol, or ocular irritation. Usually unilateral lower eyelid involvement. Typically
self-limited and can be treated by avoiding
precipitating factors.
 Tourette syndrome: Multiple compulsive

muscle spasms associated with utterances
of bizarre sounds or obscenities.
 Tic

douloureux (trigeminal neuralgia):
Acute episodes of pain in the distribution
of the fifth cranial nerve, often causing a
wince or tic.

 Tardive dyskinesia: Orofacial dyskinesia,

often with dystonic movements of the
trunk and limbs, typically from long-term
use of antipsychotic medications.
 Apraxia of eyelid opening. Usually associ-

ated with Parkinson disease. Unlike blepahrospasm, apraxia of eyelid opening does
not feature orbicularis spasm. Instead,
apraxic patients simply cannot voluntarily
open the eyelids.

Etiology
 Idiopathic and likely multifactorial, pos-

sibly involving dopaminergic pathways
within the basal ganglia.

Work-Up
1. History: Unilateral or bilateral? Are the
eyelids alone involved or are the facial and
limb muscles also involved? Medications?
2. Slit-lamp examination: Examination for
ocular disorders such as dry eyes, blepharitis, or a foreign body.
3. Neuro-ophthalmic examination to rule out
other accompanying abnormalities.
4. Typical blepharospasm does not require
CNS imaging as part of the work-up. MRI

of the brain with attention to the posterior
fossa is reserved for atypical cases or other
diagnoses (e.g., hemifacial spasm).

Treatment
1. Treat any underlying eye disorder causing
ocular irritation. See 4.3, Dry-Eye Syndrome,
and 5.8, Blepharitis/Meibomitis.
2. Consider botulinum toxin injections into
the orbicularis muscles around the eyelids
if the blepharospasm is severe.
3. If the spasm is not relieved with botulinum toxin injections, consider surgical
excision of the orbicularis muscle from
the upper eyelids and brow (e.g., limited
myectomy).
4. Muscle relaxants and sedatives are rarely of
value but can be helpful in some patients.
Oral medications such as lorazepam can
help but their use is often limited by their
sedative qualities.

Follow-Up
Not an urgent condition, but with severe
blepharospasm, patients can be functionally
blind.

CANALICULITIS

Symptoms

Differential Diagnosis

Tearing or discharge, red eye, mild tenderness
over the nasal aspect of the lower or upper
eyelid.

 Dacryocystitis: Infection of the lacrimal sac

with more lacrimal sac swelling, tenderness,
and pain than canaliculitis. See 6.9, Dacryocystitis/Inflammation of the Lacrimal Sac.

Signs
(See Figure 6.8.1.)
Critical. Erythematous pouting of the
punctum and erythema of the surrounding
skin. Expression of mucopurulent discharge
or concretions from the punctum is diagnostic.
Other. Recurrent conjunctivitis confined to
the nasal aspect of the eye, gritty sensation on
probing of the canaliculus, and focal injection
of the nasal conjunctiva.

 Chalazion: Focal inflammatory eyelid nod-

ule without discharge from punctum. See
6.2, Chalazion/Hordeolum.
 Nasolacrimal duct obstruction: Tearing,

minimal-to-no erythema or tenderness
around the punctum. See 8.10, Congenital
Nasolacrimal Duct Obstruction.

Etiology
 Actinomyces israelii (streptothrix): Most com-

mon. Gram-positive rod with fine, branching filaments.
 Other bacteria (e.g., Fusobacterium and

Nocardia species).
 Fungal (e.g., Candida, Fusarium, and Asper-

gillus species).

the punctum at the slit lamp. A canaliculotomy is usually required for complete
removal or in the setting of a retained
punctual plug. If necessary, marsupialize
the horizontal canaliculus from a conjunctival approach and allow incision to heal by
secondary intention.
2. If concretions are removed, consider irrigating the canaliculus with an antibiotic solution (e.g., trimethoprim sulfate/
polymyxin B, moxifloxacin, penicillin
G solution 100,000 units/mL, iodine 1%
solution). The patient is irrigated while
in the upright position, so the solution
drains out of the nose and not into the
nasopharynx.
3. Treat the patient with antibiotic drops
(e.g., trimethoprim sulfate/polymyxin B,
moxifloxacin) q.i.d. and oral antibiotics
for 1 to 2 weeks (e.g., doxycycline 100 mg
b.i.d.).

2. Smears and cultures of the material expressed
from the punctum, including slides for
Gram stain and Giemsa stain. Consider thioglycolate and Sabouraud cultures.

4. If a fungus is found on smears and cultures,
nystatin 1:20,000 drops t.i.d. and nystatin
1:20,000 solution irrigation several times
per week may be effective. If evidence of
herpes virus is found on smears, treat with
trifluridine 1% drops five times per day.
Silicone intubation along with appropriate
antiviral therapy is sometimes required in
viral canaliculitis.

3. Ask about a history of punctal plug placement in the past.

5. Apply warm compresses to the punctal area
q.i.d.

Treatment

Follow-Up

1. Remove obstructing concretions or retained
plug. Concretions may be expressed through

Five to 7 days depending on severity. This is
usually not an urgent condition.

1. Apply gentle pressure over the lacrimal
sac with a cotton-tipped swab and roll it
toward the punctum while observing for
mucopurulent discharge or concretions.

Dacryocystitis/Inflammation of the Lacrimal Sac

145

 Frontal sinus mucocele/mucopyocele: The

swelling typically occurs well above the
medial canthal tendon. Proptosis and
external ophthalmoplegia are often present. Imaging is diagnostic.

Etiology
 Almost always related to nasolacrimal duct

obstruction.
 Uncommon causes include diverticula of the

lacrimal sac, dacryoliths, nasal or sinus surgery, trauma, and rarely a lacrimal sac tumor.

nasally. A mucoid or purulent discharge can
be expressed from the punctum when pressure is applied over the lacrimal sac.
NOTE: Swelling in dacryocystitis is below the medial
canthal tendon. Suspect lacrimal sac tumor (rare) if
mass is above the medial canthal tendon.

Other. Fistula formation from the skin
beneath the medial canthal tendon. A lacrimal sac cyst or mucocele can occur in chronic
cases. Progression to a lacrimal sac abscess, and
rarely, orbital or facial cellulitis may occur.

Differential Diagnosis
 Facial cellulitis involving the medial can-

thus: No discharge from punctum with
pressure over the lacrimal sac. The lacrimal
drainage system is patent on irrigation. See
6.10, Preseptal Cellulitis.
 Dacryocystocele: Mild enlargement of a non-

inflamed lacrimal sac in an infant. Present
at birth but may not be detected until later.
Caused by nasolacrimal duct obstruction or
entrapment of mucus or amniotic fluid in
the lacrimal sac and is usually unilateral. If
bilateral, assess breathing to rule out nasal
obstruction. Conservative therapy with antibiotic ointment and warm compresses is
usually sufficient for nonobstructive cases.
 Acute ethmoid sinusitis: Pain, tenderness,

nasal obstruction, and erythema over the
nasal bone, just medial to the inner canthus. Patients may be febrile. Imaging is
diagnostic.

LWBK1000-C06_p135-152.indd 145

 Gram-positive bacteria are the most com-

mon pathogens; however, Gram-negative
and atypical organisms are seen more commonly in diabetics, immunocompromised,
and nursing home patients.

Work-Up
1. History: Previous episodes? Concomitant
ear, nose, or throat infection?
2. External examination: Apply gentle pressure to the lacrimal sac in the nasal corner
of the lower eyelid with a cotton-tipped
swab in an attempt to express discharge
from the punctum. Perform bilaterally to
uncover subtle contralateral dacryocystitis.
3. Ocular examination: Assess extraocular
motility both for proptosis, and for other
evidence of orbital cellulitis.
4. Obtain a Gram stain and blood agar culture
(and chocolate agar culture in children) of
any discharge expressed from the punctum.
5. Consider a CT scan of the orbits and paranasal sinuses in atypical cases, severe cases,
and those that do not respond to appropriate antibiotics.
NOTE: Do not attempt to probe or irrigate the
lacrimal system during the acute infection.

Treatment
1. Systemic antibiotics in the following regimen:
Children older than 5 years and <40 kg:
—Afebrile, systemically well, mild case, and
reliable parent: Amoxicillin/clavulanate: 25
to 45 mg/kg/day p.o. in two divided doses

2. Topical antibiotic drops (e.g., trimethoprim/polymyxin B q.i.d.) may be used
in addition to systemic therapy. Topical
therapy alone is not adequate.
3. Apply warm compresses and gentle massage to the inner canthal region q.i.d.
4. Administer pain medication (e.g., acetaminophen with or without codeine) p.r.n.
5. Consider incision and drainage of a pointing abscess.
6. Consider surgical correction (e.g., dacryocystorhinostomy with silicone intubation)
only after the acute episode has resolved,
particularly with chronic dacryocystitis.

Follow-Up
Daily until improvement confirmed. If the
condition of an outpatient worsens, hospitalization and i.v. antibiotics are recommended.

depending on the rate of improvement, but
systemic antibiotic therapy should be continued for a full 10- to 14-day course.

Critical. Eyelid erythema, tense edema,
warmth, tenderness. No proptosis, no optic
neuropathy, no restriction of extraocular
motility, usually little conjunctival injection, and no pain with eye movement
(unlike orbital cellulitis). The patient may
not be able to open the eye because of the
eyelid edema.

Other. Tightness of the eyelid skin or fluctuant
lymphedema of the eyelids. The eye itself may
be slightly injected but is relatively uninvolved.

Differential Diagnosis
 Orbital cellulitis: Proptosis, pain with eye

movement, restricted motility. See 7.3.1,
Orbital Cellulitis.
 Chalazion: Focal inflammatory eyelid nod-

ule. See 6.2, Chalazion/Hordeolum.
 Allergic: Sudden onset, nontender itchy, swol-

len eyelids. See 5.11, Contact Dermatitis.
 Erysipelas: Rapidly advancing streptococ-

cal cellulitis, often with a clear demarcation
line, high fever, and chills.
 Necrotizing fasciitis: Severe bacterial infec-

tion involving the subcutaneous soft tissue
and deep fascia. Typically due to group A
beta-hemolytic streptococci and Staphylococcus aureus. Grayish-purplish skin discoloration with local hypesthesia characteristic.
Patients are often septic and may rapidly
deteriorate. This potentially fatal condition
requires emergent surgical debridement
with i.v. antibiotic treatment.
 Viral conjunctivitis with secondary eyelid

swelling: Follicular conjunctivitis present.
See 5.1, Acute Conjunctivitis.
 Cavernous sinus thrombosis: Proptosis with

multiple cranial neuropathies. See 10.10,
Cavernous Sinus and Associated Syndromes
(Multiple Ocular Motor Nerve Palsies).
 Varicella zoster virus: Vesicular rash that

respects midline. See 4.16, Herpes Zoster
Ophthalmicus/Varicella Zoster Virus.
 Other orbital disorders: Proptosis, globe dis-

placement, or restricted ocular motility. See
7.1, Orbital Disease.
 Others: Insect bite, angioedema, trauma,

maxillary osteomyelitis, ocular vaccinia
(see 4.17, Ocular Vaccinia), and others.

Preseptal Cellulitis

Organisms
S. aureus and Streptococcus are most common, but Haemophilus influenzae should be
considered in nonimmunized children. Suspect anaerobes if a foul-smelling discharge or
necrosis is present or if there is a history of
an animal or a human bite. Consider a viral
cause if preseptal cellulitis is associated with
a vesicular skin rash (e.g., herpes simplex or
varicella zoster).

Work-Up
1. History: Pain with eye movements? Prior
trauma or cancer? Sinus congestion or
purulent nasal discharge? Recent smallpox
vaccine?
2. Complete ocular examination: Look carefully for restriction of ocular motility or
proptosis. An eyelid speculum or Desmarres
eyelid retractor may facilitate the ocular
examination if the eyelids are excessively
swollen.

4. Palpate the periorbital area and the head
and neck lymph nodes for a mass.
5. Check vital signs.
6. Obtain Gram stain and culture of any open
wound or drainage.
7. Perform CT scan of the brain and orbits
(axial and coronal views) with contrast if
there is a history of significant trauma or a
concern about the possibility of an orbital
or intraocular foreign body, orbital cellulitis, a subperiosteal abscess, paranasal
sinusitis, cavernous sinus thrombosis, or
malignancy.

5. Nasal decongestants if sinusitis is present.
6. Orbital exploration and debridement is
warranted if a fluctuant mass or abscess is
present, or if a retained foreign body is suspected. Obtain Gram stain and culture of
any drainage. Avoid the orbital septum if
possible. A drain may need to be placed.
7. Consider an Infectious Disease consult in
patients who have failed oral antibiotics
and require i.v. treatment.

Follow-Up
Daily until clear and consistent improvement
is demonstrated, then every 2 to 7 days until
the condition has totally resolved. If a preseptal cellulitis progresses despite antibiotic therapy, the patient is admitted to the hospital and
a repeat (or initial) orbital CT scan is obtained.
For patients already on p.o. antibiotics, switch
to i.v. antibiotics (see 7.3.1, Orbital Cellulitis).

MALIGNANT TUMORS OF THE EYELID

Symptoms

Signs
Skin ulceration and inflammation with distortion of the normal eyelid anatomy. Abnormal
color, texture, or persistent bleeding. Loss of
eyelashes (madarosis) or whitening of eyelashes (poliosis) over the lesion. Sentinel
vessels may be seen. Diplopia or external ophthalmoplegia are ominous and signs of possible orbital invasion.

Multiple small papules characterized by a
central umbilication. Can be severe in HIVpositive patients. May produce a chronic
follicular conjunctivitis. Treat lesions by
unroofing and curettage. While some recommend curettage until bleeding occurs, there
is no clear evidence that this is more effective. A variety of other therapies (e.g., cryotherapy, cautery, chemical, laser) are used for
lesions found elsewhere on the body but are
typically not necessary for periocular regions

Congenital nevi may be present at, or
shortly after, birth; however, most nevi
appear during childhood and may enlarge
during puberty. Nevi are well-circumscribed
lesions, usually round or oval, with uniform
pigmentation. Melanomas may develop
within preexisting nevi and may manifest
as a changing pigmented lesion and/or as a
pigmented lesion with asymmetry of shape,
irregular borders, color variegation, and
possibly pruritus or bleeding. Suspicious
lesions should be biopsied, preferably with
removal of the entire lesion to the subcutaneous fat.
 Xanthelasma: Multiple, often bilateral,

soft yellow plaques of lipid-laden macrophages in the upper and sometimes lower
eyelids. Patients 40 years and younger
should have a serum cholesterol and lipid
profile evaluation to rule out hypercholesterolemia. Surgical excision can be performed for cosmesis; however, recurrence
is possible.
 Squamous papilloma: Soft, skin-colored

lesions that may be smooth, rounded,
or pedunculated. May enlarge slowly
over time. Often spontaneously regress.
Occasionally squamous carcinomas can
appear papillomatous. Therefore, excisional biopsy should be performed for suspicious lesions.

or nodules are often mistaken for xanthelasma.

Etiology
 Basal cell carcinoma: Most common malig-

nant eyelid tumor, usually on the lower
eyelid or medial canthus of middle-aged
or elderly patients. Rarely metastasizes but
may be locally invasive, particularly when
it is present in the medial canthal region.
There are two forms:
—Nodular: Indurated, firm mass, commonly with telangiectases over the tumor
margins. Sometimes the center of the lesion
is ulcerated (see Figure 6.11.1). On rare
occasions, a cystic variant is seen.
—Morpheaform: Firm, flat, subcutaneous
lesion with indistinct borders. More difficult to excise and may result in a large eyelid defect.
 Sebaceous gland carcinoma: Usually in

middle-aged or elderly patients. Most common on the upper eyelid but may be multifocal, involving both the upper and the
lower eyelids. Often confused with recurrent chalazia or intractable blepharitis. Loss
of eyelashes and destruction of the meibomian gland orifices in the region of the
tumor may occur. Regional and systemic
metastasis or orbital extension is possible.
Can follow many decades after radiation
exposure to the eyelids (see Figure 6.11.2).
 Squamous cell carcinoma: Variable presen-

tation, often appearing similar to a basal

 Inflammatory conditions: Blepharitis, bleph-

aroconjunctivitis.
 Allergic conditions: Chronic contact der-

matitis can appear unilateral, cause cilia
loss, and simulate malignancy.
 Others: Verrucae from human papilloma-

virus, benign tumors of hair follicles or
sweat glands, inverted follicular keratosis,
neurofibroma, neurilemmoma, capillary
hemangioma, cavernous hemangioma,
and pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia.
Necrobiotic xanthogranuloma nodules of

cell carcinoma. Regional metastasis may
occur and can be extensive with a propensity for perineural invasion. A premalignant lesion, actinic keratosis, may appear
either as a scaly, erythematous flat lesion or
as a cutaneous horn.
 Keratoacanthoma: This lesion was previ-

ously considered to be benign and selflimiting; however, it is now regarded as a
low-grade squamous cell carcinoma. Clinically may resemble basal and squamous cell
carcinomas. Typically, the lesion is elevated
with rolled margins and a large central
ulcer filled with keratin. Rapid growth with
slow regression and even spontaneous resolution have been observed. Lesions usually
involve the lower eyelid and can be destructive. Complete excision is recommended.
 Others: Malignant melanoma, lymphoma;

sweat gland carcinoma, metastasis (usually
breast or lung), Merkel cell tumor, Kaposi
sarcoma, and others.

Work-Up
1. History: Duration? Rapid or slow growth?
Previous malignant skin lesion or other
malignancies? Previous treatment of inflammatory or allergic condition? Previous radiation therapy?
2. External examination: Check the skin for
additional lesions, palpate the preauricular, submaxillary, and cervical nodes for
metastasis.

LWBK1000-C06_p135-152.indd 151

5. Perform a biopsy of the lesion. An incisional
biopsy is commonly performed when a
malignancy is suspected. Depending on
the depth of invasion, sentinel node biopsy
may be indicated with eyelid melanoma.
Histopathologic confirmation must precede
any extensive procedures.

past, fresh tissue with oil red-O staining was
recommended. This is no longer necessary
if the pathologist is experienced with this
malignancy.

6

7. For lymphoma, the pathologist would prefer
the tissue to be sent fresh for flow cytometry.
Contact the pathologist first. If confirmed,
a systemic work-up is indicated. See 7.4.2,
Orbital Tumors in Adults.

Treatment
1. Basal cell carcinoma: Surgical excision with
histologic evaluation of the tumor margins
either by frozen sections or by Mohs techniques. The entire tumor should be excised
with clean margins. Cryotherapy and radiation are used rarely. Topical imiquimod,
an immune modulator, is a newer treatment that might be beneficial but could
be toxic to the surface of the eye. Patients
are informed about the etiologic role of the
sun and are advised to avoid sunlight when
possible and to use protective sunscreens.
2. Sebaceous gland carcinoma: Poorly responsive to radiation. Excision requires the use
of permanent sectioning for negative margins prior to attempted reconstruction.
Map biopsies of the bulbar and palpebral
conjunctiva should be performed in all
cases because of the propensity for skip
lesions. Close follow-up of regional nodes
is indicated. Exenteration is often required
when orbital invasion is present. Referral to

oncologist or internist for systemic work-up

6

ternist for regional and/or systemic workup and surveillance is important.
NOTE: Because both melanoma and sebaceous
gland carcinoma are difficult to diagnose by
frozen section, multiple excisions utilizing permanent sectioning may be necessary until all surgical margins are free of tumor. The cornea and
globe must be protected during this interim time
with lubrication or temporary tarsorrhaphies.

3. Squamous cell carcinoma: Same as for basal
cell carcinoma. Radiation therapy is the
second-best treatment after surgical excision.
Patients are informed about the etiologic role
of the sun. Referral to an oncologist or internist for regional and/or systemic work-up
and surveillance is important.

Follow-Up

4. Malignant melanoma: Treatment requires
wide surgical excision. The margins must
be free of tumor and require permanent
sections. Sentinel lymph node biopsy may
be required depending on the depth of
the tumor. Referral to an oncologist or in-

Initial follow-up is every 1 to 4 weeks to ensure
proper healing of the surgical site. Patients are
then reevaluated every 6 to 12 months, or
more frequently, for more aggressive lesions.
Patients who have had one skin malignancy
are at greater risk for additional malignancies.

ORBITAL DISEASE

This section provides a framework to evaluate
a variety of orbital diseases.

2. Infectious: Orbital cellulitis, subperiosteal
abscess, etc.

Symptoms

3. Neoplastic (benign and malignant): Dermoid cyst, capillary hemangioma, rhabdomyosarcoma, metastasis, lymphangioma,
optic nerve glioma, neurofibroma, leukemia, lymphoproliferation (including lymphoma), neurilemmoma, mucocele, etc.

Eyelid swelling, bulging eye(s), and double
vision are common. Pain and decreased vision
can occur.

Signs
Critical. Proptosis and restriction of ocular
motility, which can be confirmed by forcedduction testing (see Appendix 6, Forced-Duction
Test and Active Force Generation Test). Resistance
to retropulsion of the globe is common.

Differential Diagnosis of Pseudoproptosis
 Enlarged globe (e.g., myopia). Large, myo-

pic eyes frequently have tilted discs and
peripapillary crescents, and ultrasonography (US) reveals a long axial length.
 Enophthalmos of the fellow eye (e.g., after

an orbital floor fracture).
 Asymmetric eyelid position: Unilateral up-

per and/or lower eyelid retraction, or contralateral upper eyelid ptosis.

Etiology
Rarely, specific signs of orbital disease are
diagnostic. Otherwise, orbital disease can be
grouped into five broad categories to help tailor the necessary work-up:
1. Inflammatory: Thyroid eye disease (TED),
idiopathic orbital inflammatory syndrome
(IOIS), sarcoidosis, Wegener granulomatosis,
etc.

7

4. Trauma: Orbital fracture, retrobulbar hemorrhage, orbital foreign body, carotidcavernous fistula, etc.
5. Malformation: Congenital, vascular, etc.

Work-Up
1. History: Rapid or slow onset? Pain? Ocular
bruit and/or pulsation? Fever, chills, systemic symptoms? History of cancer, diabetes, pulmonary disease, or renal disease?
Skin rash? Trauma?
2. Vital signs, particularly temperature.
3. External examination:
—In addition to classic axial exophthalmos,
also look for nonaxial displacement of the
globe (e.g., hypoglobus, hyperglobus).
—Test for resistance to retropulsion by gently pushing each globe into the orbit with
your thumbs.
—Feel along the orbital rim for a mass.
Check the conjunctival cul-de-sacs carefully and evert the upper eyelid.
—Check extraocular movements. Measure
any ocular misalignment with prisms (see

Orbit

Cover Tests).
—To examine for proptosis, tilt the patient’s
head back and look from below (“ant’s-eye
view”). Measure with a Hertel exophthalmometer. Position the exophthalmometer against the lateral orbital rims, not the
lateral canthi. Upper limits of normal are
approximately 22 and 24 mm in white
people and black people, respectively. A
difference between the two eyes of more
than 2 mm is considered abnormal. Can
be used in conjunction with a Valsalva
maneuver if a venous malformation is
suspected.

7

4. Ocular examination: Specifically check
the size and reactivity of the pupils, visual
fields, color vision (by color plates), intraocular pressure (IOP), optic nerves (pallor,
swelling), posterior pole (especially for chorioretinal folds), and peripheral retina.
5. Imaging studies: Orbital computed tomography (CT) (axial and coronal views) or
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with
gadolinium and fat suppression, depending
on suspected etiology. Orbital US with or
without color Doppler imaging is useful if

7.2

6. Laboratory tests when appropriate: Triiodothyronine (T3), thyroxine (T4), selective thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH),
thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin, complete blood count (CBC) with differential,
Westergren erythrocyte sedimentation rate
(ESR), antinuclear antibody (ANA), blood
urea nitrogen (BUN)/creatinine (if CT contrast or gadolinium are indicated in at-risk
individuals), fasting blood sugar, blood
cultures, angiotensin-converting enzyme
(ACE), cytoplasmic antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (cANCA), prostate-specific
antigen, lactate dehydrogenase, etc.
7. Consider a forced-duction test in select
cases. See Appendix 6, Forced-Duction Test
and Active Force Generation Test.
8. Consider an excisional or incisional biopsy,
as dictated by the working diagnosis.
Fine-needle aspiration biopsy has a limited
role in orbital diagnosis.
Additional work-up, treatment, and follow-up
vary according to the suspected diagnosis. See
individual sections.

INFLAMMATORY ORBITAL DISEASE

7.2.1. THYROID EYE DISEASE
Synonyms: THYROID-RELATED ORBITOPATHY
OR GRAVES DISEASE
Ocular Symptoms
Early: Nonspecific complaints including foreign-body sensation, redness, tearing, photophobia, and morning puffiness of the eyelids.
Early symptoms are often nonspecific and
may mimic allergy, blepharoconjunctivitis,
chronic conjunctivitis, etc.
Late: Eyelid and orbital symptoms including
eyelid retraction, prominent eyes, persistent
eyelid swelling, double vision, “pressure”

or vascular lesion is suspected. See Chapter
14, Imaging Modalities in Ophthalmology.

behind the eyes, and decreased vision in one
or both eyes.

Signs
(See Figure 7.2.1.1.)
Critical. Retraction of the upper eyelids
(highly specific) with lateral flare and eyelid
lag on downward gaze (von Graefe sign), lagophthalmos. Lower lid retraction is less specific for TED. Unilateral or bilateral axial proptosis with variable resistance to retropulsion.
When extraocular muscles are involved, elevation and abduction are commonly restricted
and there is resistance on forced-duction
testing. Although often bilateral, unilateral
or asymmetric TED is also frequently seen.

6 to 12 months; a significant proportion will
develop thyroid abnormalities. Concomitant
myasthenia gravis with fluctuating double
vision and ptosis may occur in a minority of
patients. TED does not necessarily follow the
associated thyroid dysfunction and may occur
months to years before or after the thyroid
dysfunction. The clinical progression of TED
also has only minimal correlation to control
of the thyroid dysfunction.

Differential Diagnosis of Eyelid Retraction
 Previous eyelid surgery may produce eyelid

Thickening of the extraocular muscles (inferior, medial, superior, and lateral, in order of
frequency) without involvement of the associated tendons may be noted on orbital imaging. Isolated enlargement of the superior or
lateral recti muscles is highly atypical of TED
and requires further work-up.
NOTE: Optic nerve compression caused by thickened extraocular muscles at the orbital apex can
produce an afferent pupillary defect, reduced color vision, visual field, and visual acuity loss. Compressive optic neuropathy occurs in a minority of
patients (5%) with TED but must be ruled out in
every patient at every visit. Optic neuropathy in the
setting of TED almost invariably occurs in the setting
of restrictive strabismus and increased resistance to
retropulsion. Counterintuitively, in cases of compressive optic neuropathy from TED, axial proptosis
is usually either absent or mild.

Other. Reduced frequency of blinking, inferior chemosis, significantly elevated IOP (especially in upgaze), injection of the blood vessels
over the insertion sites of horizontal rectus
muscles, superior limbic keratoconjunctivitis,
superficial punctate keratopathy, or infiltrate
or ulceration from exposure keratopathy.

Systemic Signs
Hyperthyroidism is common. Symptoms
include a rapid pulse, hot and dry skin, diffusely enlarged thyroid gland (goiter), weight
loss, muscle wasting with proximal muscle
weakness, hand tremor, pretibial dermopathy or
myxedema, cardiac arrhythmias. Some patients
are hypo- or euthyroid. Euthyroid patients
should undergo thyroid function testing every

retraction or eyelid lag.
 Severe contralateral ptosis may produce

eyelid retraction because of Hering Law,
especially if the nonptotic eye is amblyopic.
 Third cranial nerve palsy with aberrant

regeneration: The upper eyelid may elevate
with downward gaze, simulating eyelid lag
(pseudo-von Graefe sign). Ocular motility
may be limited, but results of forced-duction
testing and orbital imaging are normal.
Eyelid retraction is typically accentuated in
adduction or in downgaze. See 10.6, Aberrant
Regeneration of the Third Nerve.

7

 Parinaud syndrome: Eyelid retraction and

limitation of upward gaze may accompany
convergence-retraction nystagmus and mildly dilated pupils that react poorly to light
with an intact near response (light-near dissociation).

Work-Up
1. History: Duration of symptoms? Pain?
Change in vision? Known thyroid disease
or cancer? Smoker?
2. Complete ocular examination to establish
the diagnosis and to determine whether the
patient is developing exposure keratopathy
(slit-lamp examination with fluorescein
staining) or optic nerve compression (afferent pupillary defect, color plate deficiency,
optic nerve edema). Diplopia is measured
with prisms (see Appendix 3, Cover/Uncover
and Alternate Cover Tests) and proptosis is
measured with a Hertel exophthalmometer.
Check IOP in both primary and upgaze

of inferior rectus muscle enlargement).
Dilated fundus examination with optic nerve
assessment.
3. CT of the orbit (axial and coronal views
without contrast) is performed when presentation is atypical (e.g., all cases of unilateral proptosis or any bilateral proptosis
without upper eyelid retraction), or in the
presence of severe congestive orbitopathy
or optic neuropathy. CT in TED varies from
patient to patient. In patients with restrictive strabismus and minimal proptosis
(“myogenic variant”), imaging may show
thickened extraocular muscles without the
involvement of the associated tendons. In
patients with full or nearly full extraocular motility, severe proptosis, and exposure
keratopathy (“lipogenic variant”), increased
fat volume with minimal muscle involvement is typical.

7

4. Formal visual field testing when signs or
symptoms of optic nerve compression are
present.
5. Thyroid function tests (T3, T4, selective
TSH). These may be normal. Thyroidstimulating immunoglobulin is sometimes
ordered, but the clinical significance of this
test is still unclear.
6. Work-up for suspected myasthenia gravis is
necessary in selected cases. See 10.11, Myasthenia Gravis.

Treatment
1. Smoking cessation: All patients with TED
who smoke must be explicitly told that
continued tobacco use increases the risk
of progression and the severity of the
orbitopathy. This conversation should be
clearly documented in the medical record.
2. Refer the patient to a medical internist or
endocrinologist for management of systemic thyroid disease, if present. If TFTs
are normal, the patient’s TFTs should be
checked every 6 to 12 months.
3. Treat exposure keratopathy with artificial
tears and lubrication or by taping eyelids
closed at night (see 4.5, Exposure Keratopathy). Swimmer’s goggles at night may be

LWBK1000-C07_p153-176.indd 156

helpful. The use of topical cyclosporine
drops for the treatment of ocular surface
inflammation in TED is still under investigation, but is a reasonable long-term treatment
option if dry-eye syndrome is present.
4. Treat eyelid edema with cold compresses in
the morning and head elevation at night.
The use of systemic diuretics for eyelid
edema is controversial and is usually not
recommended.
5. Indications for orbital decompression surgery include: Optic neuropathy, worsening or severe exposure keratopathy despite
adequate treatment, globe luxation, uncontrollably high IOP, cosmesis.
6. A stepwise approach is used for surgical
treatment, starting with orbital decompression (if needed), followed by strabismus surgery (for significant strabismus, if present),
followed by eyelid surgery. Alteration of this
sequence may lead to unpredictable results.
The following recommendations are somewhat controversial:
 Corticosteroids: During the acute inflamma-

tory phase, prednisone 1 mg/kg p.o. q.d., tapered over 4 to 6 weeks, is a reasonable temporizing measure to improve proptosis and
diplopia in preparation for orbital decompression surgery. Recently, pulse intravenous
corticosteroids have been recommended in
the European literature to arrest the progression of the orbitopathy. The dosing schedule
is still under investigation, but is being used
more frequently by clinicians. Corticosteroid
injection into the orbital fat for local control
of orbitopathy has also been described, but
at present the efficacy of this modality remains unclear. Chronic systemic corticosteroids for long-term management have been
advocated by some, but in general should be
avoided because of the systemic side effects.
 Orbital irradiation: The use of orbital radia-

tion in the management of TED is still under active debate. It may be used as a modality in the acute inflammatory phase of TED.
Irradiation may have a limited benefit for
the management of diplopia and compressive optic neuropathy, but does not improve

23/12/11 6:13 AM

7.2

proptosis in TED. It may, however, prevent
the progression of disease and provide longterm control. Should be used with caution
in patients with diabetes, as it may worsen
diabetic retinopathy, and in vasculopaths,
as it may increase the risk of radiation retinopathy or optic neuropathy. As a result, all
patients offered radiation therapy should be
informed of the potential risks.
Radiation is best performed according to
strict protocols with carefully controlled
dosage and shielding, under the supervision of a radiation oncologist familiar with
the technique. Typically, a total dose of
2,000 cGy is administered in 10 fractions
over 2 weeks.
Treatment may transiently exacerbate inflammatory changes, and a methylprednisolone dose pack may mitigate these symptoms. Improvement is often seen within a
few weeks of treatment, but may take several months to attain maximal effect. It is
unusual for radiation to succeed if a trial of
corticosteroids has failed.
 Biologics: Limited data are available on

the use of biologic agents (rituximab,
infliximab) for the treatment of TED that
is progressing despite the use of more conventional therapy. At present, small series
have shown promise, but the use of such
agents is off-label and should be considered
experimental.
 Visual loss from optic neuropathy: Treat im-

mediately with prednisone 100 mg p.o. q.d
with close monitoring. Radiation therapy
may be offered for mild-to-moderate optic
neuropathy, with the understanding that
there is typically a lag in the treatment
effect. Posterior orbital decompression surgery (for mild-to-severe optic neuropathy) is
usually effective in rapidly reversing or stabilizing the optic neuropathy. The role of anterior or soft-tissue (fat) decompression for
compressive optic neuropathy is controversial and in all likelihood has a very limited
effect. Decompression of the medial orbital
apex typically results in the reversal of the
optic neuropathy, but recurrence is possible
if orbital inflammation progresses. Isolated
deep lateral wall decompression has also
been advocated by some specialists.

Follow-Up
1. Optic nerve compression requires immediate attention and close follow-up.
2. Patients with advanced exposure keratopathy and severe proptosis also require
prompt attention and close follow-up.
3. Patients with minimal-to-no exposure problems and mild-to-moderate proptosis are
reevaluated every 3 to 6 months. Because
of the potential risk of optic neuropathy,
patients with restrictive strabismus may be
followed more frequently and are instructed
to check for red desaturation on a weekly
basis.
4. Patients with fluctuating diplopia or ptosis
should be evaluated for myasthenia gravis.
5. All patients with TED are instructed to
return immediately with any new visual
problems, worsening diplopia, or significant ocular irritation.

7.2.2. IDIOPATHIC ORBITAL INFLAMMATORY
SYNDROME
Synonyms: INFLAMMATORY ORBITAL
PSEUDOTUMOR
Symptoms
May be acute, recurrent, or chronic. An explosive, painful onset is the hallmark of idiopathic orbital inflammatory syndrome (IOIS).
Pain, prominent red eye, “boggy” pink eyelid
edema, double vision, or decreased vision.
Children may have concomitant constitutional symptoms (fever, headache, vomiting,
abdominal pain, lethargy) and bilateral presentation, which are not typical in adults.

Signs
Critical. Proptosis and/or restriction of
ocular motility, usually unilateral, typically
of explosive onset. On imaging studies, softtissue anatomy is involved in varying degrees.
The extraocular muscles are thickened in cases
of myositis, with involvement of the associated tendons. The sclera (in posterior scleritis), Tenon capsule (in tenonitis), orbital fat,

or lacrimal gland (in dacryoadenitis) may be
involved. The paranasal sinuses are usually
clear.
Other. Boggy, pink eyelid erythema and
edema, conjunctival injection and chemosis,
lacrimal gland enlargement or a palpable orbital
mass, decreased vision, uveitis, increased IOP,
hyperopic shift, optic nerve swelling or atrophy
(uncommon).
NOTE: Bilateral IOIS in adults can occur, but should
prompt a careful evaluation to rule out a systemic
cause (e.g., sarcoidosis, Wegener granulomatosis,
metastases, lymphoma). Children may have bilateral disease in one-third of the cases and may have
associated systemic disorders.

 Primary orbital malignancy.
 Metastasis.
 Rhabdomyosarcoma.

3. Vital signs, particularly temperature.
4. Orbital CT (axial and coronal views) with
contrast: may show a thickened posterior
sclera (the “ring sign” of 360 degrees of
scleral thickening), orbital fat or lacrimal
gland involvement, or thickening of the
extraocular muscles (including their tendons). Bony erosion is very rare in IOIS and
warrants further work-up.
5. Blood tests as needed (e.g., bilateral or
atypical cases): ESR, CBC with differential,
ANA, BUN, creatinine, and fasting blood
sugar (before instituting systemic steroids).
Consider checking ACE levels and a chest
X-ray if sarcoidosis is suspected and cANCA
if Wegener granulomatosis is suspected.
Mammography, chest imaging, and prostate evaluation are warranted in specific or
atypical cases.
6. Consider incisional biopsy when the diagnosis is uncertain, the case is atypical or
recurrent, the patient has a history of cancer,
or a patient with an acute presentation does
not respond to adequate systemic steroids
within a few days. Also consider biopsy in
cases of presumed inflammatory dacryoadenitis, because this procedure carries a low
morbidity, and the use of corticosteroids
may mask the true pathology on future
biopsy.

History of breathing problems? A careful
review of systems is warranted.
2. Complete ocular examination, including
ocular motility, exophthalmometry, IOP,
and optic nerve evaluation.

LWBK1000-C07_p153-176.indd 158

Treatment
1. Prednisone 80 to 100 mg p.o. q.d. as an
initial dose in an adult, along with gastric
prophylaxis (e.g., ranitidine 150 mg p.o.
b.i.d.). Pediatric dosages typically begin
with 1 mg/kg/day of prednisone. All patients
are warned about potential systemic side
effects and are instructed to follow up with
their primary physicians to monitor blood
sugar and electrolytes.
2. Low-dose radiation therapy may be used
when the patient does not respond to systemic corticosteroids, when disease recurs
as corticosteroids are tapered, or when
corticosteroids pose a significant risk to the
patient. Radiation therapy should only be
used once orbital biopsy has excluded other
etiologies.

Follow-Up
Reevaluate in 1 to 2 days. Patients who
respond to steroids are maintained at the
initial dose for 3 to 5 days, followed by a
slow taper to 40 mg/day over 2 weeks, and

an even slower taper below 20 mg/day, usually over several weeks. If the patient does
not respond dramatically to appropriate corticosteroid doses, biopsy should be strongly
considered.

INFECTIOUS ORBITAL DISEASE

7.3.1. ORBITAL CELLULITIS
Symptoms
Red eye, pain, blurred vision, double vision,
eyelid swelling, nasal congestion/discharge,
sinus headache/pressure/congestion, tooth
pain, infra- and/or supraorbital pain, or hypesthesia.

Signs
(See Figures 7.3.1.1 and 7.3.1.2.)
Critical. Eyelid edema, erythema, warmth,
and tenderness. Conjunctival chemosis and
injection, proptosis, and restricted ocular
motility with pain on attempted eye movement are usually present. Signs of optic neuropathy (e.g., afferent pupillary defect, dyschromatopsia) may be present in severe cases.
Other. Decreased vision, retinal venous congestion, optic disc edema, purulent discharge,
decreased periorbital sensation, fever. CT scan
usually shows an adjacent sinusitis (typically
an ethmoid sinusitis), possibly a subperiosteal
orbital collection.

Etiology
 Direct extension from a paranasal sinus

infection (especially ethmoiditis), focal
periorbital infection (e.g., dacryoadenitis,
dacryocystitis, panophthalmitis), or dental
infection.
 Sequela of orbital trauma (e.g., orbital frac-

ture, penetrating trauma, retained intraorbital foreign body).
 Sequela of orbital surgery or paranasal sinus

surgery.
 Sequela of other ocular surgery (less com-

mon).
 Vascular extension (e.g., seeding from a sys-

temic bacteremia or locally from facial cellulitis via venous anastomoses).
 Secondary

orbital venous stasis and
inflammation from a septic cavernous sinus
thrombosis.

See 7.1, Orbital Disease, for a nonspecific
orbital work-up.
1. History: Trauma or surgery? Ear, nose,
throat, or systemic infection? Tooth pain or
recent dental abscess? Stiff neck or mental
status changes? Diabetes or an immunosuppressive illness?
2. Complete ophthalmic examination: Look
for an afferent pupillary defect, limitation
of or pain with eye movements, proptosis,
increased resistance to retropulsion, elevated IOP, decreased color vision, decreased
skin sensation, or an optic nerve or fundus
abnormality.
3. Check vital signs, mental status, and neck
flexibility.
4. CT scan of the orbits and paranasal sinuses
(axial and coronal views, with contrast if
possible) to confirm the diagnosis and to
rule out a retained foreign body, orbital or
subperiosteal abscess, paranasal sinus disease, or cavernous sinus thrombosis.
5. CBC with differential.
6. Blood cultures (especially helpful in pediatric cases).
7. Explore and debride any penetrating
wound, if present, and obtain a Gram stain
and culture of any drainage (e.g., blood and

LWBK1000-C07_p153-176.indd 160

chocolate agars, Sabouraud dextrose agar,
thioglycolate broth).
8. Consult Neurology or Neurosurgery for
suspected meningitis for management
and possible lumbar puncture. If paranasal sinusitis is present, consider consultation with Otorhinolaryngology for possible
surgical drainage. Consider an Infectious
Disease consultation in atypical, severe, or
unresponsive cases. If a dental source is suspected, Oral Maxillofacial Surgery should
be consulted for assessment, since infections from this area tend to be aggressive,
potentially vision threatening, and may
spread into the cavernous sinus.
NOTE: Mucormycosis/zygomycosis is an orbital,
nasal, and sinus disease occurring in diabetic or
otherwise immunocompromised patients. Typically associated with severe pain and external
ophthalmoplegia. Profound visual loss may rapidly occur. Metabolic acidosis may be present.
Sinoorbital mucormycosis/zygomycosis is rapidly
progressive and life-threatening. See 10.10, Cavernous Sinus and Associated Syndromes (Multiple Ocular Motor Nerve Palsies).

Treatment
1. Admit the patient to the hospital and consider consultation with Infectious Disease
and Otorhinolaryngology.
2. Broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics to
cover Gram-positive, Gram-negative, and
anaerobic organisms are recommended for
48 to 72 hours, followed by oral medication
for at least 1 week. The specific antibiotic
agents vary. In patients from the community with no recent history of hospitalization, nursing home stay, or institutional
stay, we currently recommend:
—Ampicillin-sulbactam 3 g i.v. q6h in
adults; 300 mg/kg per day in four divided
doses in children, maximum daily dose 12
g ampicillin-sulbactam (8 g ampicillin component).
or
—Piperacillin-tazobactam 4.5 g i.v. q8h or
3.375 g q6h in adults; 240 mg of piper-

23/12/11 6:13 AM

7.3

acillin component/kg/day in three divided
doses in children, maximum daily dose
18 g piperacillin.
 For adults who are allergic to penicillin but

can tolerate cephalosporins, use vancomycin as dosed below plus:
—Ceftriaxone 2 g i.v. q.d. and metronidazole 500 mg i.v. q6–8h (not to exceed 4 g
per day).
 For adults who are allergic to penicillin/

cephalosporin, treat with a combination of
a fluoroquinolone (for patients >17 years of
age, moxifloxacin 400 mg i.v. daily or ciprofloxacin 400 mg i.v. q12h or levofloxacin
750 mg i.v. q.d.) and metronidazole 500 mg
i.v. q6–8h.
 Given

the prevalence of communityassociated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA), treatment with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, tetracycline
derivatives, vancomycin, or clindamycin
may also be started initially. Some clinicians
prefer to save these antibiotics and institute
them only if the patient fails to improve or
worsens over the first 48 hours of intravenous
therapy. In patients suspected of harboring
hospital-associated MRSA or in those suspected of meningitis, intravenous vancomycin is
started at 15 mg/kg q12–24h in adults with
normal renal function and 40 mg/kg per day
in two or three divided doses in children,
with a maximum daily dose of 2 g.
NOTE: Antibiotic dosages may need to be reduced
in the presence of renal insufficiency or failure.
Peak and trough levels of vancomycin are usually
monitored, and dosages are adjusted as needed.
BUN and creatinine levels are monitored closely.

3. Nasal decongestant spray as needed for up
to 3 days. Nasal corticosteroid spray may
also be added to quicken the resolution of
sinusitis.
4. Erythromycin ointment q.i.d. for corneal
exposure and chemosis if needed.
5. If the orbit is tight, an optic neuropathy
is present, or the IOP is severely elevated,

immediate canthotomy/cantholysis may
be needed. See 3.10, Traumatic Retrobulbar
Hemorrhage, for technique.
6. The use of systemic corticosteroids in the
management of orbital cellulitis remains
controversial. If systemic corticosteroids
are considered, it is probably safest to wait
24 to 48 hours until an adequate intravenous antibiotic load has been given (three
to four doses).

Follow-Up
Reevaluate at least twice daily in the hospital
for the first 48 hours. Severe infections may
require multiple daily examinations. Clinical
improvement may take 24 to 36 hours.
1. Progress is monitored by:
—Patient’s symptoms.
—Temperature and white blood cell count
(WBC).

7

—Visual acuity and evaluation of optic
nerve function.
—Ocular motility.
—Degree of proptosis and any displacement of the globe (significant displacement may indicate an abscess).
NOTE: If clinical deterioration is noted after an
adequate antibiotic load (three to four doses),
a CT scan of the orbit and brain with contrast
should be repeated to look for abscess formation
(see 7.3.2, Subperiosteal Abscess). If an abscess
is found, surgical drainage may be required. Radiographic findings may lag behind the clinical
examination, and so clinical deterioration itself
may be an indication for surgical drainage. Other conditions that should be considered when
the patient is not improving include cavernous
sinus thrombosis, meningitis, or a noninfectious
etiology.

2. Evaluate the cornea for signs of exposure.
3. Check IOP.
4. Examine the retina and optic nerve for
signs of posterior compression (e.g., chorioretinal folds), inflammation, or exudative
retinal detachment.

5. When orbital cellulitis is clearly and consistently improving, then the regimen can be
changed to oral antibiotics (depending on
the culture and sensitivity results) to complete a 10- to 14-day course. We often use:
—Amoxicillin/clavulanate: 25 to 45 mg/
kg/day p.o. in two divided doses for children, maximum daily dose of 90 mg/kg/
day; 875 mg p.o. q12h for adults.
or
—Cefpodoxime: 10 mg/kg/day p.o. in
two divided doses for children, maximum
daily dose of 400 mg; 200 mg p.o. q12h for
adults.

7

Doxycycline or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole are also reasonable alternatives, especially
if CA-MRSA is suspected.
The patient is examined every few days as an
outpatient until the condition resolves and
instructed to return immediately with worsening signs or symptoms.
NOTE: Medication noncompliance is an extremely
common reason for recurrence or failure to improve.
The oral antibiotic regimen should be individualized
for ease of use and affordability. Effective generic
alternatives include doxycycline and trimethoprim/
sulfamethoxazole.

7.3.2. SUBPERIOSTEAL ABSCESS
Signs and Symptoms
Similar to orbital cellulitis, though may be
magnified in scale. Suspect an abscess if a
patient with orbital cellulitis fails to improve or
deteriorates after 48 to 72 hours of intravenous
antibiotics.

Differential Diagnosis
 Intraorbital abscess: Rare, because perios-

teum is an excellent barrier to intraorbital
spread. May be seen following penetrating
trauma, previous surgery, retained foreign
body, extrascleral extension of endophthalmitis, extension of subperiosteal abscess
(SPA), or from endogenous seeding. Treatment is surgical drainage and intravenous

LWBK1000-C07_p153-176.indd 162

antibiotics. Drainage may be difficult because
of several isolated loculations.
 Cavernous sinus thrombosis: Rare in era

of antibiotics. Most commonly seen with
Mucormycosis/Zygomycosis [see 10.10, Cavernous Sinus and Associated Syndromes (Multple
Ocular Motor Nerve Palsies)]. In bacterial cases,
the patient is usually also septic and may be
obtunded and hemodynamically unstable.
Prognosis is guarded in all cases. Manage
with hemodynamic support (usually in intensive care unit), broad-spectrum antibiotics, and surgical drainage if an infectious
nidus is identified (e.g., paranasal sinuses,
orbit). Anticoagulation can be considered.

Work-Up
See 7.3.1, Orbital Cellulitis, for work-up. In
addition:
1. Obtain CT with contrast, which allows for
easier identification and extent of abscess.
In cases of suspected cavernous sinus
thrombosis, discuss with the radiologist
before CT, since special CT techniques and
windows may help with diagnosis. MRI
may also be indicated.
NOTE: All orbital cellulitis patients who do not improve after 48 to 72 hours of intravenous antibiotic
therapy should undergo repeat imaging.

Treatment
1. Microbes involved in SPA formation are
related to the age of the patient. The causative microbes influence response to intravenous antibiotics and the need for surgical
drainage. See Table 7.3.2.1.
NOTE: These are guidelines only. Any patient
with an optic neuropathy should be drained
urgently, regardless of age. All patients with SPA
should be followed closely, regardless of age.

2. If there is an optic neuropathy, emergent
drainage of abscess is required. Drainage is
usually managed as a combined approach
with Otorhinolaryngology. Unless the
SPA is very medial and isolated, drainage

typically necessitates an external incision
for adequate orbital exploration. Occasionally, small medial abscesses may be drained
by an endoscopic approach alone.
3. Leave a drain in place for 24 to 48 hours to
prevent abscess reformation.
4. Intracranial extension necessitates neurosurgical involvement.
5. Expect dramatic and rapid improvement
after adequate drainage. Additional imaging,
exploration, and drainage may be indicated
if improvement does not occur rapidly.
6. Do not reimage immediately unless patient
is deteriorating postoperatively. Imaging
usually lags behind clinical response by at
least 48 to 72 hours.

Signs
(See Figures 7.3.3.1 and 7.3.3.2.)
Critical. Erythema, swelling, and tenderness
over the outer one-third of the upper eyelid.
May be associated with hyperemia of the palpebral lobe of the lacrimal gland, S-shaped
upper eyelid.
Other. Ipsilateral preauricular lymphadenopathy, ipsilateral conjunctival chemosis
temporally, fever, elevated WBC.

lacrimal gland metastasis: Commonly produces displacement of the globe or proptosis. May present with an acute inflammatory
clinical picture. Often palpable, evident
on CT scan. See 7.6, Lacrimal Gland Mass/
Chronic Dacryoadenitis.
 Retained foreign body, with secondary

infectious or inflammatory process: The
patient may not remember any history of
penetrating trauma.

6. Obtain smears and bacterial cultures of any
discharge.
7. Examine the parotid glands (often enlarged
in mumps, sarcoidosis, tuberculosis, lymphoma, and syphilis).
8. Perform CT scan of the orbit (axial and coronal views), preferably with contrast (see
Figure 7.3.3.3). CT is preferable to MRI in
assessment of the lacrimal gland because of
better detail of the adjacent bony anatomy.
9. If the patient is febrile, a CBC with differential and sometimes blood cultures are
obtained.

Treatment
Etiology
 Inflammatory, noninfectious: By far the

most common. More indolent and painless course in lymphoproliferation and
sarcoidosis. More acute presentation in
IOIS.

If the specific etiology is unclear, it is best to
empirically treat the patient with systemic
antibiotics (see bacterial etiology below) for 24
hours with careful clinical reassessment. The
clinical response to antibiotics can guide further

 Bacterial: Rare. Usually due to Staphylococ-

cus aureus, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, or streptococci.
 Viral: Seen in mumps, infectious mono-

nucleosis, influenza, and varicella zoster.
May result in severe dry eye due to lacrimal
gland fibrosis.

Work-Up
The following is performed when an acute
etiology is suspected. When the disease does
not respond to medical therapy or another

management and direct one toward a specific
etiology.

—For treatment, see 7.2.2, Idiopathic Orbital
Inflammatory Syndrome.
—Analgesic as needed.
2. Viral (e.g., mumps, infectious mononucleosis):
—Cool compresses to the area of swelling
and tenderness.
—Analgesic as needed (e.g., acetaminophen
650 mg p.o. q4h p.r.n.).
NOTE: Aspirin is contraindicated in children with
a viral syndrome because of the risk of Reye syndrome.

3. Bacterial or infectious (but unidentified)
etiology:
a. If mild-to-moderate:
—Amoxicillin/clavulanate: 25 to 45 mg/
kg/day p.o. in two divided doses for

165

children, maximum daily dose of 90
mg/kg/day; 875 mg p.o. q12h for adults.

—Cephalexin 25 to 50 mg/kg/day p.o. in
four divided doses for children; 250 to
500 mg p.o. q6h for adults.
b. If moderate-to-severe, hospitalize and
treat as per 7.3.1, Orbital Cellulitis.

Follow-Up
Daily until improvement confirmed. In patients
who fail to respond to antibiotic therapy,
judicious use of oral prednisone (see 7.2.2,
Idiopathic Orbital Inflammatory Syndrome) is
reasonable, as long as close follow-up is maintained. Inflammatory dacryoadenitis should
respond to oral corticosteroid therapy within
48 hours. Watch for signs of orbital involvement, such as decreased motility or proptosis,
which requires hospital admission for i.v.
antibiotic therapy and close monitoring.
Patients who fail to respond to medical therapy are managed similarly to those with
chronic dacryoadenitis, and biopsy is usually
needed. See 7.6, Lacrimal Gland Mass/Chronic
Dacryoadenitis.

FIGURE 7.4.1.1. Capillary hemangioma.

 Capillary hemangioma: Seen from birth

to 2 years, may be slowly progressive with
sudden rapid expansion. May be observed
through the eyelid as a bluish mass or be
accompanied by a red hemangioma of the
skin (strawberry nevus, stork bite), which
blanches with pressure. Proptosis may be
exacerbated by crying. It can enlarge over
6 to 12 months, but spontaneously regresses over the following several years. Not to
be confused with the unrelated cavernous
hemangioma of the orbit, typically seen in
adults (see Figure 7.4.1.1).
 Rhabdomyosarcoma: Average age of presen-

tation is 8 to 10 years, but may occur from
infancy to adulthood. May have explosive
proptosis, edema of the eyelids, a palpable
superonasal eyelid or subconjunctival mass,
new-onset ptosis or strabismus, or a history
of nosebleeds. Malignant and may metastasize. Hallmarks are rapid onset and progression. Urgent biopsy if suspected.
 Metastatic neuroblastoma: Seen during the

first few years of life. Abrupt presentation
with unilateral or bilateral proptosis, eyelid
ecchymosis, and globe displacement. The
child is usually systemically ill, and 80%
to 90% of patients presenting with orbital
involvement already have a known history
of neuroblastoma.
 Lymphangioma: Usually seen in the first

two decades of life with a slowly progressive
course but may abruptly worsen if the tumor
bleeds. Proptosis may be intermittent and
exacerbated by upper respiratory tract infections. This mass may present as atraumatic
eyelid or orbital ecchymosis. Concomitant conjunctival, eyelid, or oropharyngeal

LWBK1000-C07_p153-176.indd 167

FIGURE 7.4.1.2. T-2-weighted MRI of orbital lymphangioma with subacute blood cyst.

lymphangiomas may be noted (a conjunctival lesion appears as a multicystic mass).
MRI is often diagnostic. B-scan US, when
used, often reveals cystic spaces. Surgical extirpation is difficult (see Figure 7.4.1.2).
 Optic nerve glioma (juvenile pilocytic as-

7

trocytoma): Usually first seen at age 2 to
6 years and is slowly progressive. Painless
axial proptosis with decreased visual acuity and a relative afferent pupillary defect.
Optic atrophy or optic nerve swelling may
be present. May be associated with neurofibromatosis (types I and II), in which
case it may be bilateral. See 13.13, Phakomatoses.
 Plexiform neurofibroma: First seen in the

first decade of life and is pathognomonic
of neurofibromatosis type I. Ptosis, eyelid
hypertrophy, S-shaped deformity of the
upper eyelid, or pulsating proptosis (from
absence of the greater sphenoid wing) may
be present. Facial asymmetry and a palpable
anterior orbital mass may also be evident.
See 13.13, Phakomatoses.
 Leukemia (granulocytic sarcoma): Seen in the

first decade of life with rapidly evolving unilateral or bilateral proptosis and, occasionally,
swelling of the temporal fossa area due to a
mass. Typically, these lesions precede blood or
bone marrow signs of leukemia, usually acute
myelogenous leukemia, by several months.
Any patient with a biopsy-proven granulocytic sarcoma of the orbit must be closely followed by an oncologist for leukemia.

Orbit

NOTE: Acute lymphoblastic leukemia also can
produce unilateral or bilateral proptosis.

Work-Up

Treatment

1. History: Determine the age of onset and the
rate of progression. Does the proptosis vary
(e.g., with crying)? Nosebleeds? Systemic illness? Fever? Recent URI? Purulent nasal discharge?

1. Dermoid and epidermoid cysts: Complete
surgical excision with the capsule intact. If
the cyst ruptures, the contents can incite an
acute inflammatory response.

2. External examination: Look for an anterior
orbital mass, a skin hemangioma, or a temporal fossa lesion. Measure any proptosis (Hertel
exophthalmometer) or globe displacement.
Refer to a pediatrician for abdominal examination to rule out mass or organomegaly.

7

—Neuroblastoma: Abdominal CT scan,
urine for vanillylmandelic acid.

3. Complete ocular examination, including
visual acuity, pupillary assessment, color
vision, IOP, refraction, and optic nerve evaluation.
4. CT (axial and coronal views) of the orbit and
brain. If neoplasia is suspected, orbital MRI
(with gadolinium-DTPA and fat suppression). Imaging may be performed urgently
to rule out true pediatric orbital emergencies such as infection and rhabdomyosarcoma.
5. If paranasal sinus opacification is noted in
the clinical setting of orbital inflammation,
initiate immediate systemic antibiotic therapy (see 7.3.1, Orbital Cellulitis).
6. In cases of acute onset and rapid progression with evidence of mass on imaging, an
emergency incisional biopsy for frozen and
permanent microscopic evaluation is indicated to rule out an aggressive malignancy
(e.g., rhabdomyosarcoma).
7. Other tests as determined by the working
diagnosis (usually performed in conjunction with a pediatric oncologist):
—Rhabdomyosarcoma: Physical examination (look especially for enlarged lymph
nodes), chest and bone radiographs, bone
marrow aspiration, lumbar puncture, liver
function studies.
—Leukemia: CBC with differential, bone
marrow studies, others.

LWBK1000-C07_p153-176.indd 168

2. Capillary hemangioma: Observe if not
causing visual obstruction, astigmatism,
and amblyopia. All capillary hemangiomas
will eventually involute. In the presence of
visual compromise (e.g., amblyopia, optic
neuropathy) several treatment options exist:
a. Oral corticosteroids may be used: 2 to
3 mg/kg, tapered over 6 weeks. IOP must
be monitored, and patients should be
placed on GI prophylaxis.
b. A local corticosteroid injection (e.g., betamethasone 6 mg/mL and triamcinolone 40 mg/mL) may be given to shrink
the lesion if necessary. Care should be
taken to avoid orbital hemorrhage and
central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO)
during injection. Skin atrophy and depigmentation are other potential complications. Periocular injection of triamcinolone is not recommended by the
manufacturer because of the potential
risk of embolic infarction. See note in
6.2, Chalazion/Hordeolum.
c. Systemic beta blockers: While the exact mechanism remains unclear and its
use is off label, case reports and small
case series have shown propranolol to
be a viable option in the treatment
of refractory capillary hemangiomas.
Some nonophthalmic studies recommend this as first-line treatment if
the hemangioma is rapidly proliferating. Side effects of propranolol include
hypoglycemia, hypotension, and bradycardia. Asthmatics and those with reactive airway disease are at risk of bronchospasm. Therefore, patients should
be evaluated by a pediatrician pretreatment and monitored throughout
the course of treatment.

d. Surgical excision.
e. Interferon therapy: Usually reserved for
large or systemic lesions which may be
associated with a consumptive coagulopathy or high-output congestive heart
failure (Kasabach–Merritt syndrome).
There is a risk of spastic diplegia with
this therapy. This therapy is not used
frequently because of other viable alternatives, including propranolol.
3. Rhabdomyosarcoma: Managed by urgent
biopsy and referral to a pediatric oncologist
in most cases. Local radiation therapy and
systemic chemotherapy are given once the
diagnosis is confirmed by biopsy and the
patient has been appropriately staged. Significant orbital and ocular complications are
common even with prompt and aggressive
management. Overall, the long-term prognosis for orbital rhabdomyosarcoma is good
in the absence of extraorbital extension.
4. Lymphangioma: Most are managed by observation. Surgical debulking is performed for
a significant cosmetic deformity, ocular dysfunction (e.g., strabismus and amblyopia),
or compressive optic neuropathy from acute
orbital hemorrhage. Incidence of hemorrhage into the lesion is increased after surgery. May recur after excision. Aspiration
drainage of hemorrhagic cysts (“chocolate
cysts”) may temporarily improve symptoms.
5. Optic nerve glioma: Controversial. Observation, surgery, and radiation are used variably on a case-by-case basis.
6. Leukemia: Managed by a pediatric oncologist. Systemic chemotherapy for the leukemia. Some physicians administer orbital radiation therapy alone in isolated orbital lesions
(chloromas), when systemic leukemia cannot
be confirmed on bone marrow studies. However, patients need to be monitored closely
for eventual systemic involvement.

tend to be vascular.

Follow-Up

require urgent attention.
2. Tumors that progress more slowly may be
managed less urgently.

Symptoms
Prominent eye, double vision, decreased

Signs
Critical. Proptosis, pain, displacement of the

orbital mass on palpation, mass found with
neuroimaging. Specific tumors may cause
enophthalmos secondary to orbital fibrosis.

6. Other neurogenic tumors: optic nerve glioma, optic nerve sarcoid, malignant optic

7. Lymphangioma: Usually discovered in
childhood. See 7.4.1, Orbital Tumors in
Children.
 Primarily Extraconal:

1. Mucocele: Often a frontal headache and
a history of chronic sinusitis or sinus
trauma. Usually nasally or superonasally
located, emanating from the frontal and
ethmoid sinuses.
2. Localized neurofibroma: Occurs in youngto middle-aged adults with slow development of orbital signs. Eyelid infiltration
results in an S-shaped upper eyelid. Some
have neurofibromatosis type I, but most
do not.
3. SPA or hematoma: See 7.3.2, Subperiosteal
Abscess.
4. Dermoid cyst: See 7.4.2, Orbital Tumors
in Adults.

LWBK1000-C07_p153-176.indd 171

5. Others: Tumors of the lacrimal gland [(pleomorphic adenoma (well circumscribed),
adenoid cystic carcinoma (variably circumscribed)], sphenoid wing meningiomas,
secondary tumors extending from the
brain or paranasal sinuses, primary osseous
tumors, and vascular lesions (e.g., varix,
arteriovenous malformation).
 Intraconal or Extraconal:

1. Lymphoproliferative disease (lymphoid
hyperplasia and lymphoma): More commonly extraconal. About 50% are well
circumscribed on imaging, 50% are infiltrative. Usually occurs in middle-aged
to elderly adults. Slow onset and progression. Typically develops superiorly
in the anterior aspect of the orbit. May
be accompanied by a subconjunctival,
salmon-colored lesion. More indolent
clinically and less responsive to systemic
steroids than IOIS. Can occur without
evidence of systemic lymphoma.
2. Metastatic: Usually occurs in middleaged to elderly people with a variable
onset of orbital signs. Common primary sources include the breast (most

common in women), lung (most common in men), genitourinary tract (especially prostate), and gastrointestinal
tract. Twenty percent of orbital breast
cancer metastases are bilateral and frequently involve extraocular muscles.
Enophthalmos (not proptosis) may be
seen with scirrhous breast carcinoma.
Uveal metastases are far more common,
outpacing orbital lesions by 10:1.
3. Others: Mesenchymal tumors and other
malignancies.

Work-Up
1. History: Determine the age of onset and
rate of progression. Headache or chronic
sinusitis? History of cancer? Trauma (e.g.,
mucocele, hematocele, orbital foreign body,
ruptured dermoid)?

7

2. Complete ocular examination, particularly
visual acuity, pupillary response, ocular
motility, color vision and visual field of each
eye, measurement of globe displacement
(from the bridge of the nose with a ruler)
and proptosis (Hertel exophthalmometer),
IOP, and optic nerve evaluation. Examine
conjunctival surface and cul-de-sacs carefully
for salmon patches if lymphoma suspected.
3. CT (axial and coronal views) of the orbit
and brain or orbital MRI with fat suppression/gadolinium-DPTA, depending on suspected etiology and age. See 14.2, Computed
Tomography.
4. Orbital US with color Doppler imaging as
needed to define the vascularity of the lesion.
Conventional B-scan has a limited role in the
diagnosis of orbital pathology because of the
availability and resolution of CT and MRI.
5. When a metastasis is suspected and primary
tumor is unknown, the following should be
performed:
—Incisional biopsy to confirm the diagnosis, with estrogen receptor assay if breast
carcinoma is suspected.
—Breast examination and palpation of
axillary lymph nodes by the primary physician.

LWBK1000-C07_p153-176.indd 172

—Medical work-up (e.g., chest radiograph,
mammogram, prostate examination).
6. If lymphoproliferative disease (lymphoma or
lymphoid hyperplasia) is suspected, biopsy
for definitive diagnosis is indicated. Include
adequate fixed tissue for immunohistochemistry and fresh tissue for flow cytometry. If
lymphoproliferative disease is confirmed,
the systemic work-up is almost identical
for polyclonal (lymphoid hyperplasia) and
monoclonal (lymphoma) lesions [e.g., CBC
with differential, serum protein electrophoresis, lactate dehydrogenase, and wholebody imaging (CT/MRI or positron emission
tomography/CT)]. Bone marrow biopsy may
be indicated in certain forms of lymphoma.
Close surveillance with repeat testing is indicated over several years in all patients with
lymphoproliferative disease, regardless of
clonality. A significant percentage of patients
initially diagnosed with orbital lymphoid
hyperplasia will eventually develop systemic
lymphoma.

Treatment
1. Metastatic disease: Systemic chemotherapy as
required for the primary malignancy. Radiation therapy is often used palliatively for the
orbital mass; high-dose radiation therapy
may result in ocular and optic nerve damage.
Hormonal therapy may be indicated in certain cases (e.g., breast, prostate carcinoma).
Carcinoid tumors are occasionally resected.
2. Well-circumscribed lesions: Complete surgical excision is performed when there is
compromised visual function, diplopia, rapid
growth, or high suspicion of malignancy.
Excision for cosmesis can be offered if the
patient is willing to accept the surgical risks.
An asymptomatic patient can be followed
every 6 to 12 months with serial examinations and imaging. Progression of symptoms
and increasing size on serial imaging are indications for exploration and biopsy/excision.
3. Mucocele: Systemic antibiotics (e.g.,
ampicillin/sulbactam 3 g i.v. q6h) followed by surgical drainage of the mucocele and possible exenteration of the
involved sinus.

23/12/11 6:13 AM

7.5

4. Lymphoid tumors: Lymphoid hyperplasia
and lymphoma without systemic involvement are treated almost identically. With
few exceptions, orbital lymphoproliferations
respond dramatically to relatively low doses
of radiation; ocular and optic nerve complications are therefore much rarer than with
other malignancies. Systemic lymphoma is
treated with chemotherapy and in many
cases with biologics (e.g., rituximab). The
majority of orbital lymphoma is of B-cell
origin, and most are of the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue subtype, presently
called extranodal marginal zone lymphoma
(EMZL). In older individuals with few symptoms and indolent lesions, more conservative measures may be indicated, including
observation alone or brief courses of corticosteroids. To date, there is no clear role for the
use of systemic antibiotics in the treatment
of orbital lymphoproliferative disease. There
is also no clear evidence that orbital EMZL
is in any way related to Helicobacter pyloriassociated gastric EMZL.
5. ONSM: The diagnosis is usually based on
slow progression and typical MRI findings.
MRI with gadolinium is the preferred imaging modality. CT is occasionally helpful in
demonstrating intralesional calcifications.
Stereotactic radiation therapy is usually indicated when the tumor is growing and causing significant visual loss. Otherwise, the
patient may be followed every 3 to 6 months
with serial clinical examinations and imaging studies as needed. Recent studies have
shown significant efficacy of stereotactic
radiotherapy in decreasing tumor growth
and in visual preservation. Stereotactic radio-

7.5

173

therapy is not equivalent to gamma knife
therapy (“radiosurgery”). Empiric stereotactic radiotherapy (i.e., without confirmatory
biopsy) is a reasonable treatment option but
is reserved for typical cases of ONSM. Atypical or rapidly progressive lesions still require
biopsy.
6. Localized neurofibroma: Surgical removal is
performed for symptomatic and enlarging
tumors.
7. Neurilemmoma: Same as for cavernous
hemangioma (see above).
8. Solitary fibrous tumor (including fibrous histiocytoma and hemangiopericytoma): Complete excision when possible. The lesion may
be fixed to the surrounding normal anatomy
and abut critical structures. In such cases,
debulking is reasonable, with long-term
follow-up and serial imaging to rule out
aggressive recurrence or potential malignant
transformation.

7

Follow-Up
1. In cases of isolated lesions that can be completely excised (e.g., cavernous hemangioma), routine ophthalmologic follow-up is
all that is necessary.
2. Other etiologies require long-term followup at variable intervals.
3. Metastatic disease requires work-up without delay.

LACRIMAL GLAND MASS/CHRONIC
DACRYOADENITIS

Symptoms
Persistent or progressive swelling of the outer
one-third of the upper eyelid. Pain or double
vision may be present.

Signs
Critical. Chronic eyelid swelling, predominantly in the outer one-third of the upper
eyelid, with or without proptosis and displacement of the globe inferiorly and medially. Erythema is less common.

7

Other. A palpable mass may be present in
the outer one-third of the upper eyelid. Extraocular motility may be restricted. May have
conjunctival injection.

Etiology
 Sarcoidosis: May be bilateral. May have

concomitant lung, skin, or ocular disease.
Lymphadenopathy, parotid gland enlargement, or seventh nerve palsy may be present. More common in American blacks and
white Northern Europeans.
 IOIS: See 7.2.2, Idiopathic Orbital Inflamma-

tory Syndrome. Chronic, painless lacrimal
gland enlargement is atypical for IOIS.
 Infectious: Enlarged palpebral lobe with sur-

more posterior lesions hide effectively into
adulthood. May rarely rupture, causing acute
swelling and inflammation. Well-defined,
cystic, extraconal mass noted on CT.
 Lymphoproliferative tumor: Slowly progres-

sive proptosis and globe displacement in a
middle-aged or elderly patient. May have a
pink “salmon-patch” area of subconjunctival
extension. CT usually shows a lacrimal gland
lesion that conforms to the native anatomy
and does not erode bone. About 50% of lesions will be well circumscribed. Bony erosion
may be seen in aggressive histopathology.
 Adenoid cystic carcinoma: Subacute onset

of pain over 1 to 3 months, proptosis, and
diplopia, with variable progression. Globe
displacement, ptosis, and a motility disturbance are common. This malignant lesion
often exhibits perineural invasion, resulting in significant pain and intracranial
extension. CT shows an irregular mass, often with bony erosion (see Figure 7.6.1).
 Malignant mixed epithelial tumor (pleomor-

phic adenocarcinoma): Occurs primarily in
elderly patients, acutely producing pain and
progressing rapidly. Usually develops within
a long-standing benign mixed epithelial

rounding conjunctival injection. Purulent
discharge with bacterial dacryoadenitis.
Bilateral lacrimal gland enlargement may
be seen in patients with viral illnesses. CT
scan may show fat stranding, abscess.
 Benign mixed epithelial tumor (pleomor-

phic adenoma): Slowly progressive, painless
proptosis or displacement of the globe in
middle-aged adults. Usually involves orbital
lobe of lacrimal gland. CT may show a wellcircumscribed mass with pressure-induced
remodeling and enlargement of the lacrimal gland fossa. No bony erosion occurs.
 Dermoid cyst: Typically a painless, subcu-

taneous cystic mass that enlarges slowly.
Anterior lesions manifest in childhood, while

tumor (pleomorphic adenoma), or secondarily, as a recurrence of a previously resected
benign mixed tumor. CT findings are similar
to those for adenoid cystic carcinoma.
 Lacrimal gland cyst (dacryops): Usually an

asymptomatic mass that may fluctuate in
size. Typically occurs in a young adult or
middle-aged patient.
 Others: Tuberculosis, syphilis, leukemia,

mumps, mucoepidermoid carcinoma, plasmacytoma, metastasis.

suspected (e.g., abdominal and head CT
scan, possible bone marrow biopsy).
NOTE: Do not perform an incisional biopsy on lesions thought to be benign mixed tumors or dermoid cysts. Incomplete excision of a benign mixed
tumor may lead to a recurrence with or without
malignant transformation. Rupture of a dermoid
cyst may lead to a severe inflammatory reaction.
These two lesions must be completely excised
without rupturing the capsule or pseudocapsule.

Treatment
NOTE: Primary neoplasms (except lymphoma)
are almost always unilateral; inflammatory disease may be bilateral. Lymphoma is more commonly unilateral, but may be bilateral.

Work-Up
1. History: Determine the duration of the
abnormality and rate of progression. Associated pain, tenderness, double vision?
Weakness, weight loss, fever, or other signs
of systemic malignancy? Breathing difficulty, skin rash, or history of uveitis (sarcoidosis)? Any known medical problems?
Prior lacrimal gland biopsy or surgery?
2. Complete ocular examination: Specifically
look for keratic precipitates, iris nodules,
posterior synechiae, and old retinal periphlebitis from sarcoidosis.
3. Orbital CT (axial and coronal views): MRI
is rarely required unless intracranial extension is suspected. CT is helpful in defining
bony anatomy and abnormality.
4. Consider a chest radiograph or chest CT,
which may diagnose sarcoidosis, primary
malignancy, lymphoproliferative disease,
metastatic disease, and, rarely, tuberculosis.
5. Consider CBC with differential, ACE, cANCA,
SPEP, RPR, FTA-ABS, and PPD with anergy
panel if clinical history suggests a specific
etiology. In most cases, ACE level suffices.
6. Lacrimal gland biopsy is indicated when
a malignant tumor is suspected, or if the
diagnosis is uncertain.
7. Systemic work-up by an internist or hematologist/oncologist when lymphoma is

LWBK1000-C07_p153-176.indd 175

1. Sarcoidosis: Systemic corticosteroids or
low-dose antimetabolite therapy. See 12.6,
Sarcoidosis.
2. IOIS: Systemic corticosteroids. See 7.2.2,
Idiopathic Orbital Inflammatory Syndrome.
3. Benign mixed epithelial tumor: Complete
surgical removal.
4. Dermoid cyst: Complete surgical removal.

7

5. Lymphoma:
—Confined to the orbit: Orbital irradiation, corticosteroids in indolent cases, systemic surveillance.
—Systemic involvement: Chemotherapy.
Orbital irradiation is usually withheld until
the response of the orbital lesion to chemotherapy can be evaluated.
6. Adenoid cystic carcinoma: Consider orbital
exenteration with irradiation. Systemic chemotherapy is used. Consider pretreatment
with intraarterial cisplatinum, followed by
wide excision, including exenteration and
possible craniectomy. Proton beam radiotherapy is offered by some centers. Regardless of the treatment regimen, prognosis is
guarded and recurrence is the rule. There is
no clear evidence that wide craniofacial resection improves survival. Survival appears to be
most dependent on specific tumor subtype.
7. Malignant mixed epithelial tumor: Same as
for adenoid cystic carcinoma.
8. Lacrimal gland cyst: Excise if symptomatic.

Follow-Up
Depends on the specific cause.

MISCELLANEOUS ORBITAL DISEASES

1. Intracranial disease. Extension of intracranial tumors, usually frontal lobe or sphenoid wing meningiomas, may present with
proptosis in addition to cranial neuropathy
and decreased vision. Imaging, preferably
with MRI, is indicated.

7

2. Arteriovenous fistula (AVF) (e.g., carotid–
cavernous or dural sinus fistula): AVF is either
spontaneous (usually in older patients) or
post-traumatic (in younger patients). A bruit
is sometimes heard by the patient and may be
detected if ocular auscultation is performed.
Pulsating proptosis, arterialized “corkscrew”
conjunctival vessels, increased IOP, retinal
venous congestion, and chemosis may be
present. May mimic orbital disease, including
TED and IOIS. In early stages, often misdiagnosed as conjunctivitis, asymmetric glaucoma, etc. CT scan reveals enlarged superior
ophthalmic vein, sometimes accompanied by
enlarged extraocular muscles. Orbital color
Doppler US shows reversed, arterialized flow
in superior ophthalmic vein. MRA or CTA
may reveal AVF but definitive diagnosis usually requires arteriography. Evidence of posterior cortical venous outflow on arteriography
increases the risk of hemorrhagic stroke.
3. Septic cavernous sinus thrombosis: Orbital
cellulitis signs, plus dilated and sluggish
pupils as well as palsies of the third, fourth,
fifth, and sixth cranial nerves out of proportion to the degree of orbital edema.
Decreasing level of consciousness, nausea,
vomiting, and fevers may be seen. May be
bilateral with rapid progression.
4. Orbital vasculitis (e.g., Wegener granulomatosis, polyarteritis nodosa): Systemic
signs and symptoms of vasculitis (especially
sinus, renal, pulmonary, and skin disease),
fever, markedly increased ESR, positive
cANCA, or pANCA. cANCA may be normal
in one-third of patients with limited sinoorbital Wegener granulomatosis.
5. Varix: A large, dilated vein in the orbit that
produces proptosis when it fills and dilates
(e.g., during a Valsalva maneuver or with the

LWBK1000-C07_p153-176.indd 176

head in a dependent position). When the
vein is not engorged, the proptosis disappears. CT demonstrates the dilated vein if an
enhanced scan is performed during a Valsalva
maneuver. Calcification may be seen in longstanding lesions.
6. Poorly understood processes:
 Tolosa Hunt syndrome: NOT equivalent to

orbital apical IOIS. Histopathologically, a
granulomatous inflammation of the orbital
apex and/or carotid siphon within the cavernous sinus. Presents with acute pain, cranial neuropathy, and sometimes proptosis.
A diagnosis of exclusion. Difficult to diagnose with CT. MRI shows isolated ipsilateral
enlargement of the cavernous sinus. Usually sensitive to corticosteroid therapy, but
may not respond as rapidly as IOIS. Because
confirmatory biopsy is usually not feasible,
every patient with presumed Tolosa Hunt
syndrome must be followed long term,
even after rapid response to corticosteroids,
to rule out other etiologies. Repeat imaging
is usually indicated several months after
the initial event to rule out progression.
Presumed Tolosa Hunt syndrome recurs in
a minority of patients.
 Sclerosing orbital pseudotumor: Likely

not a true orbital inflammation and certainly not a subtype of IOIS. Presents with
chronic pain, external ophthalmoplegia,
and possibly optic neuropathy. Diagnosis
requires biopsy. Histopathology shows
wide swaths of monotonous fibrous tissue interspersed with mild inflammation.
Treatment is difficult and may necessitate
antimetabolite therapy, debulking, and
in severe cases, exenteration.
 Orbital amyloid: May be primary (iso-

lated) or secondary to systemic disease.
All patients require a systemic work-up,
including a cardiology consult to rule out
cardiomyopathy. Diagnosis is made by
judicious orbital biopsy (this lesion is highly vascular and hemostasis is often difficult
to obtain). Treatment is highly variable.

LEUKOCORIA

Definition
A white pupillary reflex (see Figure 8.1.1).

Etiology
 Retinoblastoma: A malignant tumor of the

retina that appears as a white, nodular mass
that breaks through the internal limiting
membrane into the vitreous (endophytic),
as a yellowish subretinal mass lesion often
underlying a serous retinal detachment (exophytic), or as a diffusely spreading lesion
simulating uveitis (diffuse infiltrating). Iris
neovascularization is common. Pseudohypopyon and vitreous seeding may occur. Cataract is uncommon, and the eye is normal in
size. May be bilateral, unilateral, or multifocal. Diagnosis is usually made between 12
and 24 months of age. A family history may
be elicited in about 10%.

dragging, traction retinal detachment, and
cataract. It is rarely bilateral and is usually
diagnosed between 6 months and 10 years
of age. Paracentesis of the anterior chamber may reveal eosinophils; serum enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test
for Toxocara organisms is positive. The
patient may have a history of contact with
puppies or eating dirt. Toxocariasis may
also be acquired prenatally and present as
a congenital infection.
 Coats disease (see Figure 8.1.2): A retinal

vascular abnormality resulting in small
multifocal outpouchings of the retinal vessels. Leukocoria may develop secondary
to an exudative retinal detachment or to
extensive yellow intraretinal and subretinal
exudate. Usually develops in boys during
the first decade of life; more severe cases

 Toxocariasis: A nematode infection that

may appear as a localized, white, elevated
granuloma in the retina or as a diffuse
endophthalmitis. Associated with localized
inflammation of ocular structures, vitreous traction bands and related macular

occur in early childhood. Coats disease is
rarely bilateral. No family history.
 Persistent fetal vasculature (PFV)/persistent

hyperplastic primary vitreous (PHPV): A
developmental ocular abnormality consisting of a varied degree of glial and vascular
proliferation in the vitreous cavity. It is
usually associated with a slightly small eye.
Typically there is a membrane behind the
lens that may place traction on the ciliary
processes. This is a progressive condition
with a cataract present at birth or early in
life. The membrane and lens may rotate
anteriorly, shallowing the anterior chamber and resulting in secondary glaucoma.

3. Any or all of the following may be helpful
in diagnosis and planning treatment:
—B-scan ultrasonography (US), especially if
there is no view of the fundus. This can be
used to look for calcification within a suspected lesion.
—Intravenous fluorescein angiogram (Coats
disease, ROP, retinoblastoma).
—Computed tomographic (CT) scan or
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the
orbit and brain (retinoblastoma), particularly for bilateral cases or those with a family history, as well as for cases of advanced

vated, yellow-white retinal mass that may be
calcified and is often associated with tuberous sclerosis and rarely neurofibromatosis.
May occur on the optic nerve head (giant
drusen) in patients with tuberous sclerosis.
 Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP): Pre-

dominantly occurs in premature children.
Leukocoria is usually the result of a retinal
detachment. See 8.2, Retinopathy of Prematurity.
 Others: Retinochoroidal coloboma, retinal

detachment, familial exudative vitreoretinopathy (FEVR), myelinated nerve fibers,
uveitis, incontinentia pigmenti, toxoplasmosis.

Work-Up
1. History: Age at onset? Family history of one
of the conditions mentioned? Prematurity?
Contact with puppies or habit of eating dirt?
2. Complete ocular examination, including
a measurement of corneal diameters (look
for a small eye), an examination of the
iris (look for neovascularization), and an

LWBK1000-C08_p177-203.indd 178

—Anterior chamber paracentesis (toxocariasis). See Appendix 13, Anterior Chamber
Paracentesis.
NOTE: Anterior chamber paracentesis in a
patient with a retinoblastoma can possibly lead
to tumor cell dissemination.

4. Consider examination under anesthesia
(EUA) in young or uncooperative children, particularly when retinoblastoma,
toxocariasis, Coats disease, or ROP is being considered as a diagnosis. See 8.8,
Congenital Cataract, for a more specific
cataract work-up.

Treatment
1. Retinoblastoma: Chemoreduction, intraarterial chemotherapy, cryotherapy, thermotherapy, laser photocoagulation, or plaque
radiotherapy. These treatment modalities
are typically used in combination. Enucleation is now reserved for cases not amenable
to the above treatment options. Systemic
chemotherapy is used in metastatic disease.

23/12/11 1:54 AM

Irradiation is no longer used as it is associated with a high incidence of secondary
tumors later in life.
2. Toxocariasis:

routes may be used, depending on the
severity of the inflammation).

Retinopathy of Prematurity

after the stage (e.g., stage 3+). If vascular dilatation and tortuosity are present but inadequate
to diagnose plus disease, it is called “pre-plus”
disease and noted after the stage (e.g., stage 3
with pre-plus disease). Posterior ROP (usually
Zone I) with plus disease out of proportion to the
peripheral retinopathy, or so-called “rush” disease (also known as aggressive posterior disease),
may progress rapidly to stage 5 ROP without
passing through the other stages. This aggressive
ROP may also show hemorrhages at the junction
between vascular and avascular retina.
Threshold Disease
Defines high-risk eyes that meet the criteria
for treatment:

FIGURE 8.2.4. Retinopathy of prematurity after laser

treatment.

—Zone I, any stage with plus disease.
—Zone I, stage 3, no plus disease.
—Zone II, stage 2 or 3 with plus disease.
Prethreshold Disease
Defines less severely advanced eyes that
should be monitored closely for progression
to threshold disease:

2. Threshold disease: Ablative treatment of
avascular zone of retina. Laser photocoagulation is preferred over cryotherapy. Treatment should be instituted within 72 hours
(see Figure 8.2.4).

—Zone I, stage 1 and 2 without plus disease.

3. Stages 4 and 5: Surgical repair of retinal detachment by scleral buckling, vitrectomy
surgery, or both.

—Zone II, stage 3 without plus disease.

Follow-Up

Screening Recommendations
 Birth weight <1,500 g.
 Gestational age ≤32 weeks.
 Selected infants with birth weight of 1,500

to 2,000 g or gestational age ≥32 weeks with
unstable clinical course thought to be at
high risk.
 Timing of first eye examination is based on

gestational age at birth.

Work-Up
1. Dilated retinal examination with scleral
depression at 31 to 32 weeks after date of
mother's last menstrual period, or 4 weeks
after birth, whichever is later.
2. Can dilate with combination phenylephrine
1.0% and cyclopentolate 0.2%.

Treatment
Based on severity. The presence of plus disease
is typically an indication for early treatment.
1. Prethreshold disease: Close observation.

 One week or less: Zone I, stage 1 or 2; or

zone II, stage 3.
 One to 2 weeks: Immature vascularization,

zone I; or zone II, stage 2; or zone I, regressing ROP.
 Two weeks: Zone II, stage 1; or zone II,

regressing ROP.
 Two to 3 weeks: Immature vascularization,

zone II, no ROP; or zone III, stage 1 or 2; or
zone III, regressing ROP.
1. Children who have had ROP have a
higher incidence of myopia, strabismus,
amblyopia, macular dragging, cataracts,
glaucoma, and retinal detachment. An
untreated fully vascularized fundus needs
examination at age 6 months to rule out
these complications.
NOTE: Because of the possibility of late retinal
detachments and other ocular complications,
ROP patients should be followed at yearly
intervals for life.

2. Acute-phase ROP screening can be discontinued when any of the following
signs is present, indicating that the risk
of visual loss from ROP is minimal or
passed:

is doubt about the zone or if the postmenstrual age is unexpectedly young, confirmatory examinations may be warranted.

—Zone III retinal vascularization attained

8.3

FAMILIAL EXUDATIVE VITREORETINOPATHY

Symptoms
Majority are asymptomatic, but patients may
report decreased vision.

Signs
(See Figure 8.3.1.)

8

—Full retinal vascularization.

Critical. Peripheral retinal capillary nonperfusion, most prominently temporally, and
may be present for 360 degrees. Bilateral but
may be asymmetric. Peripheral retinal vessels
have a fimbriated border. Present at birth.
Other. Peripheral neovascularization and/or
fibrovascular proliferation at the border of vascular and avascular retina; temporal dragging
of macula through contraction of fibrovascular tissue; vitreous hemorrhage; tractional,
exudative, or rhegmatogenous retinal detachment; peripheral intraretinal and subretinal
lipid exudation. May present with strabismus
or leukocoria in childhood. Cataract, band

keratopathy, neovascular glaucoma, or phthisis possible.

Differential Diagnosis
 Retinopathy of prematurity: Appears similar

to FEVR, but there should be no family history, and there should be a history of prematurity. See 8.2, Retinopathy of Prematurity.
 See 8.1, Leukocoria, for additional differen-

tial diagnosis, e.g., retinoblastoma, Coats,
PFV/PHPV, incontinentia pigmenti, Norrie
disease, X-linked retinoschisis, and peripheral retinal nonperfusion. Positive family
history and bilaterality can help distinguish from others.

Etiology
Due to defects in the Wnt signaling pathway.
Usually autosomal dominant, though autosomal recessive, and X-linked cases have been
reported. No history of prematurity or oxygen
therapy. FEVR is similar to ROP, histologically.

Work-Up
1. History: Positive family history? No history
of prematurity or oxygen therapy?
2. Complete ocular examination, including
dilated retinal examination with a slit lamp
and a 60- or 90-diopter lens looking for
temporal dragging of the macula. Indirect
ophthalmoscopy looking for peripheral
nonperfusion, fibrovascular membranes,
tractional retinal detachment. All family
members should also have dilated retinal
examinations.

Treatment

progression. Small, stable tufts of neovascularization can be observed. Scleral buckling and
vitrectomy can be considered for retinal detachments. Often complicated by proliferative vitreoretinopathy. Treat amblyopia as needed.

8.4
(See Figure 8.4.1.)

Critical. Either eye is turned inward. The
nonfixating eye turns outward to fixate
straight ahead when the previously fixating
eye is covered during the cover–uncover test.
See Appendix 3, Cover/Uncover and Alternate
Cover Tests.
Other. Amblyopia, overaction of the inferior
oblique muscles.

Differential Diagnosis
 Pseudoesotropia: The eyes appear esotropic;

however, there is no ocular misalignment
detected during cover–uncover testing.
Usually, the child has a wide nasal bridge,
prominent epicanthal folds, or a small
interpupillary distance (see Figure 8.4.2).
 See 8.6, Strabismus Syndromes.

Types
Comitant or Concomitant Esotropic Deviations
A manifest convergent misalignment of the
eyes in which the measured angle of esodeviation is nearly constant in all fields of gaze at
distance fixation.

LWBK1000-C08_p177-203.indd 183

Esodeviations in Children

183

Follow-Up
Asymptomatic patients should be followed
every 6 to 12 months throughout life to monitor for progression.

ESODEVIATIONS IN CHILDREN

Signs

FIGURE 8.4.1. Esotropia.

•

1. Congenital (infantile) esotropia: Manifests by age 6 months, the angle of esodeviation is usually large (>40 to 50 prism
diopters) and mostly equal at distance and
near fixation. Refractive error is usually
normal for age (slightly hyperopic). Amblyopia is uncommon but may be present in
those who do not cross-fixate. Family history may be present but is not mandatory.
Latent nystagmus, inferior oblique overaction, and dissociated vertical deviation may
develop as late findings. Congenital esotropia can occur in up to 30% of children with
neurological and developmental disorders
(e.g., cerebral palsy, hydrocephalus).

8

2. Accommodative esotropia: Convergent
misalignment of the eyes associated with
activation of the accommodative reflex.
Average age of onset is 2.5 years.
Subtypes of accommodative esotropia:
—Refractive accommodative esotropia: These
children are hyperopic in the range of
+3.00 to +10.00 diopters (average, +4.75).
The measured angle of esodeviation is usually moderate (20- to 30-prism diopters)
and is relatively equal at distance and near

FIGURE 8.4.2. Pseudoesotropia.

Pediatrics

fixation. Full hyperopic correction eliminates the esodeviation. The accommodative convergence–accommodation angle
ratio (AC/A) is normal. Amblyopia is common at presentation.
—Nonrefractive accommodative esotropia
(high AC/A ratio): The measured angle of
esodeviation is greater at near fixation than
at distance fixation. The refractive error may
range from normal for age (slight hyperopia)
to high hyperopia (may be seen in conjunction with refractive-type accommodative
esotropia) or even myopia. Amblyopia is
common.
—Partial or decompensated accommodative esotropia: Refractive and nonrefractive accommodative esotropias that have
a reduction in the esodeviation when
given full hyperopic correction, but still
have a residual esodeviation. The residual
esodeviation is the nonaccommodative
component.

8

3. Sensory-deprivation esotropia: An esodeviation that occurs in a patient with a monocular or binocular condition that prevents
good vision.
4. Divergence insufficiency: A convergent
ocular misalignment that is greater at distance fixation than at near fixation. This is
a diagnosis of exclusion and must be differentiated from divergence paralysis, which,
when sudden in onset, can be associated
with pontine tumors, neurologic trauma,
and elevated intracranial pressure. See 10.8,
Isolated Sixth Nerve Palsy.
Incomitant Esodeviations
The measured angle of esodeviation increases
in lateral gaze at distance fixation.
1. Central nervous system pathology causing increased intracranial pressure: Acute
and new onset of diplopia secondary to an
acquired sixth nerve palsy, which may be
accompanied by nystagmus, headache, or
other focal neurologic deficits depending
on etiology.
2. Medial rectus restriction (e.g., thyroid
disease, medial orbital wall fracture with
entrapment).

LWBK1000-C08_p177-203.indd 184

3. Lateral rectus weakness (e.g., isolated sixth
cranial nerve palsy, slipped or detached lateral rectus from trauma or previous surgery).
4. See 8.6, Strabismus Syndromes, and 10.8,
Isolated Sixth Nerve Palsy, for additional
etiologies.
Other
1. Esophoria: Latent esodeviation controlled
by fusion. Eyes are aligned under binocular
conditions.
2. Intermittent esotropia: Esodeviation that
is intermittently controlled by fusion.
Becomes manifest spontaneously, especially with fatigue or illness.

Work-Up
1. History: Age of onset, frequency of crossing, prior therapy (e.g., glasses, patching).
2. Visual acuity of each eye, with best correction
and pinhole. Color vision and stereopsis.
3. Ocular motility examination; observe for
restricted movements or oblique overactions.
4. Measure the distance deviation in all fields
of gaze and the near deviation in the primary position (straight ahead) using prisms
(see Appendix 3, Cover/Uncover and Alternate Cover Tests). Look specifically for an
esotropia increasing in either side gaze.
5. Manifest and cycloplegic refractions especially if <7 years of age.
6. Complete eye examination. Look for any
cranial nerve abnormalities and causes of
sensory deprivation.
7. If acute-onset non-accommodative esotropia, divergence insufficiency or paralysis,
paralysis, or incomitant esotropia is present, a head CT scan (axial and coronal
views) and/or an MRI is necessary to rule
out an intracranial or orbital process, extraocular muscle pathology, or bony lesion.
8. With incomitant esodeviation greater in
side gaze, determine whether the lateral
rectus function is deficient or the medial
rectus is restricted. Forced-duction testing
may be necessary for that distinction (see
Appendix 6, Forced-Duction Test and Active

23/12/11 1:54 AM

8.4

Force Generation Test). This may need to be
done under anesthesia for children. Consider thyroid function tests or a work-up
for myasthenia gravis, or look for characteristics of strabismus syndromes (see 8.6,
Strabismus Syndromes).

Treatment
In all cases, correct refractive errors of +2.00
diopters or more, and in children treat any
amblyopia (see 8.7, Amblyopia).
1. Congenital esotropia: When equal vision
is obtained in the two eyes, strabismus surgery is indicated.
2. Accommodative esotropia: Glasses must be
worn full time.
a. If the patient is <6 years, correct the
hyperopia with the full cycloplegic
refraction.
b. If the patient is >6 years, attempts should
be made to give as close to the full-plus
refraction as possible, knowing that some
may not tolerate the full prescription.
Attempts to push plus lenses during the
manifest (noncycloplegic) refraction until
distance vision blurs may be tried to give
the most plus lenses without blurring distance vision. The goal of refractive correction should be straight alignment without
sacrificing visual acuity.
c. If the patient’s eyes are straight at distance with full correction, but still esotropic at near fixation (high AC/A ratio),
treatment options include the following:
• Bifocals (executive type) +2.50 or +3.00
diopter add, with top of the bifocal at
the lower pupillary border.
• Extraocular muscle surgery targeting
the near deviation only may be indicated. This typically requires posterior
fixation sutures to the muscle to modify the surgical effect for near only.
• Wearing full-plus distance glasses only.
NOTE: There is no universal agreement on
the treatment of patients with excess crossing at near only.

LWBK1000-C08_p177-203.indd 185

•

Esodeviations in Children

185

3. Non-accommodative, partially accommodative, or decompensated accommodative esotropia: Muscle surgery is usually performed
to correct only the significant residual esotropia that remains when glasses are worn.
4. Sensory-deprivation esotropia:
• Attempt to identify and correct the cause
of poor vision.
• Amblyopia treatment.
• Give the full cycloplegic correction (in fixing eye) if the patient is <6 years of age,
otherwise give the full manifest refraction.
• Muscle surgery to correct the manifest
esotropia.
• All patients with very poor vision in one
eye need to wear protective polycarbonate lens glasses at all times.

Follow-Up
At each visit, evaluate for amblyopia and measure the degree of deviation with prisms (with
glasses worn).
1. If amblyopia is present, see 8.7, Amblyopia,
for management.

8

2. In the absence of amblyopia, the child is
reevaluated in 3 to 6 weeks after a new prescription is given. If no changes are made
and the eyes are straight, the patient should
be followed several times a year when
young, decreasing to annually when stable.
3. When a residual esotropia is present while
the patient wears glasses, an attempt is made
to add more plus power to the current prescription. Children <6 years should receive
a new cycloplegic refraction; plus lenses are
pushed without cycloplegia in older children.
The maximal additional plus lens that does
not blur distance vision is prescribed. If the
eyes cannot be straightened with more plus
power, then a decompensated accommodative esotropia has developed (see preceding).
4. Hyperopia often decreases slowly after age 5
to 7 years, and the strength of the glasses may
need to be reduced so as not to blur distance
vision. If the strength of the glasses must be
reduced to improve visual acuity and the esotropia returns, then this is a decompensated
accommodative esotropia (see preceding).

EXODEVIATIONS IN CHILDREN

Signs
(See Figure 8.5.1.)
Critical. Either eye is constantly or intermittently turned outward. On the cover–uncover
test, the uncovered eye moves from the outturned position to the midline to fixate when
the previously fixating eye is covered (see
Appendix 3, Cover/Uncover and Alternate Cover
Tests).
Other. Amblyopia, “A” pattern deviation
(superior oblique overaction producing an
increased deviation in downgaze compared
to upgaze), “V” pattern deviation (inferior
oblique overaction producing an increased
deviation in upgaze compared to downgaze),
vertical deviation.

Differential Diagnosis

8

Pseudoexotropia: The patient appears to have
an exodeviation, but no movement is noted
on cover–uncover testing despite good vision
in each eye. A wide interpupillary distance,
a naturally large angle k (angle between the
pupil and the visual axis), or temporal dragging of the macula (e.g., from ROP, FEVR,
toxocariasis, or other retinal disorders) may be
responsible.

Types
1. Exophoria: Exodeviation controlled by
fusion under conditions of normal binocular vision. Usually asymptomatic, but prolonged strenuous visual activity may cause
asthenopia.

2. Intermittent exotropia: The most common
type of exodeviation in children. Onset
is usually before age 5. Frequency often
increases over time. Amblyopia is rare.
A. There are three phases:
—Phase 1: One eye turns out at distance fixation, spontaneously or when
it is covered. Usually occurs when the
patient is fatigued, sick, or not attentive. The eyes become straight within
one to two blinks or when the cover is
removed. The eyes are straight at near
fixation. Patient often closes one eye or
squints in bright sunlight. This is likely
due to dissociation and breakdown of
their binocular alignment.
—Phase 2: Increasing frequency of exotropia at distance fixation. Exophoria
begins to occur at near fixation.
—Phase 3: There is a constant exotropia
at distance and near fixations.
B. These phases can be seen in all four types
of intermittent exotropia:
—Basic: Exodeviation is approximately
the same with distance and near fixation.
—True divergence excess: Exodeviation
that remains greater at distance than near
after a period of monocular occlusion.
—Simulated divergence excess: Exodeviation that is initially greater with distance fixation than near that becomes
approximately the same after an interval
of monocular occlusion.
—Convergence insufficiency: Exodeviation is greater at near than distance. Distinct from isolated convergence insufficiency. See 13.4, Convergence Insufficiency.
3. Constant exotropia: Encountered more
often in older children. There are three
types:

FIGURE 8.5.1. Exotropia.

LWBK1000-C08_p177-203.indd 186

—Congenital exotropia: presents before
age 6 months with a large angle deviation.

23/12/11 1:54 AM

8.5

Uncommon in otherwise healthy infants
and may be associated with a central nervous system or craniofacial disorder.
—Sensory-deprivation exotropia: An eye
that does not see well for any reason may
turn outward.
—Consecutive exotropia: Follows previous
surgery for esotropia.
4. Duane syndrome, type 2: Limitation of
adduction of one eye, with globe retraction
and narrowing of the palpebral fissure on
attempted adduction. Rarely bilateral. See
8.6, Strabismus Syndromes.
5. Neuromuscular abnormalities:
—Third nerve palsy: See 10.5, Isolated Third
Nerve Palsy.
—Myasthenia gravis: See 10.11, Myasthenia
Gravis.
—Internuclear ophthalmoplegia: See 10.13,
Internuclear Ophthalmoplegia.
6. Dissociated Horizontal Deviation: A
change in horizontal ocular alignment
caused by a change in the balance of
visual input from the two eyes. Not
related to accommodation. Seen clinically
as a spontaneous unilateral exodeviation
or an exodeviation of greater magnitude
in one eye during prism and alternate
cover testing.
7. Orbital disease (e.g., tumor, idiopathic
orbital inflammatory syndrome): Proptosis
and restriction of ocular motility are usually evident. See 7.1, Orbital Disease.
8. Isolated convergence insufficiency: Usually occurs in patients >10 years. Blurred
near vision, asthenopia, or diplopia when
reading. An exophoria at near fixation,
but straight or small exophoria at distance
fixation. Must be differentiated from convergence paralysis. See 13.4, Convergence
Insufficiency.
9. Convergence paralysis: Similar to convergence insufficiency, but with a relatively
acute onset, an exotropia at near, and an
inability to overcome base out prism. Often
secondary to an intracranial lesion.

Exodeviations in Children

187

Work-Up
1. Evaluate visual acuity of each eye, with correction and pinhole, to evaluate for amblyopia. Color vision and stereopsis.
2. Perform motility examination; observing
for restricted eye movements or signs of
Duane syndrome.
3. Measure the exodeviation in all cardinal
fields of gaze at distance and in primary
position (straight ahead) at near, using
prisms. See Appendix 3, Cover/Uncover and
Alternate Cover Tests.
4. Perform pupillary, slit-lamp, and fundus
examinations; check for causes of sensory
deprivation (if poor vision).
5. Refraction (cycloplegic or manifest depending on age of the patient).
6. Consider work-up for myasthenia gravis
when suspected by evidence of fatigability.
See 10.11, Myasthenia Gravis.
7. Consider a CT scan (axial and coronal views)
or an MRI of the orbit and brain, when
orbital or neurologic disease is suspected.

8

Treatment
In all cases, correct significant refractive errors
and treat amblyopia. See 8.7, Amblyopia.
1. Exophoria:
—No treatment necessary unless it progresses to intermittent exotropia.
2. Intermittent exotropia:
—Phase 1: Follow patient closely.
—Phase 2: Muscle surgery may be considered to maintain normal binocular
vision.
—Phase 3: Muscle surgery is often indicated at this point. Bifixation or peripheral fusion can occasionally be attained.
3. Sensory-deprivation exotropia:
—Correct the underlying cause, if possible.
—Treat any amblyopia.
—Muscle surgery may be performed for
manifest exotropia.

10. Convergence paralysis:

—Muscle surgery early in life, as in
patients with congenital esotropia.

—Base-in prisms at near to alleviate diplopia.
—Plus lenses if accommodation is also
weakened.

—Prism correction in glasses can be used.

STRABISMUS SYNDROMES

Motility disorders that demonstrate typical
features of a particular syndrome.

Syndromes
 Duane syndrome: A congenital motility

disorder, usually unilateral (85%), characterized by limited abduction, limited
adduction, or both. The globe retracts and
the eyelid fissure narrows on adduction.
In unilateral cases, the strabismus will be
incomitant and the patient will often adopt
a face-turn to allow them to use both eyes
together. Classified into three types:
—Type 1 (most common): Limited abduction. Primary position frequently esotropia.
In unilateral cases, nearly always with face
turn toward affected side.
—Type 2: Limited adduction. Primary position usually exotropia. In unilateral cases,
often with face turn away from affected
side.
—Type 3: Limited abduction and adduction.
Esotropia, exotropia, or no primary position
deviation. Significant globe retraction.

LWBK1000-C08_p177-203.indd 188

2. If no amblyopia is present, then reexamine every 4 to 6 months. The parents and
patient are asked to return sooner if the
deviation increases, becomes more frequent, stays out longer, or patient begins to
close one eye.

 Brown

syndrome: A motility disorder
characterized by limitation of elevation
in adduction. Elevation in abduction is
normal. Typically, eyes are aligned in primary gaze. Usually congenital, but may
be acquired secondary to trauma, surgery, or inflammation in the area of the
trochlea, or idiopathic. Bilateral in 10% of
patients.

 Monocular elevation deficiency (double-

elevator palsy): Congenital. Unilateral
limitation of elevation in all fields of gaze
secondary to restriction of the inferior rectus or paresis of the inferior oblique and/
or superior rectus. There may be hypotropia of the involved eye that increases
in upgaze. Ptosis or pseudoptosis may be
present in primary gaze. The patient may
assume a chin-up position to maintain
fusion if a hypotropia in primary gaze is
present.
 Möbius syndrome: Rare congenital condi-

tion associated with both sixth and seventh
nerve palsies. Esotropia is usually present.

23/12/11 1:54 AM

8.7

Limitation of abduction and/or adduction,
with a unilateral or bilateral, partial or complete facial nerve palsy. Other cranial nerve
palsies as well as deformities of the limbs,
chest, and tongue may occur.
 Congenital fibrosis syndrome: Congeni-

tal group of disorders with restriction and
fibrous replacement of the extraocular
muscles. Usually involves all of the extraocular muscles with total external ophthalmoplegia and ptosis. Usually both eyes are
directed downward, so the patient assumes
a chin-up position to see. Often autosomal
dominant.

Work-Up
1. History: Age of onset? History of trauma?
Family history? History of other ocular or
systemic diseases?
2. Complete
ophthalmic
examination,
including alignment in all fields of gaze.
Note head position. Look for retraction
of globe and narrowing of interpalpebral
fissure in adduction (common in Duane
syndrome).

8.7

Amblyopia

189

3. Pertinent physical examination, including
cranial nerve evaluation.
4. Radiologic studies (e.g., MRI or CT scan)
may be indicated for acquired, atypical, or
progressive motility disturbances.
5. Forced-duction testing is used to differentiate the two etiologies of monocular elevation deficiency (test will be positive with
inferior rectus fibrosis and negative with
superior rectus and inferior oblique paresis). Forced ductions can also confirm the
diagnosis of Brown syndrome.

Treatment
1. Treatment is usually indicated for a cosmetically significant abnormal head position, or if a significant horizontal or vertical
deviation exists in primary gaze.
2. Surgery, when indicated, depends on the
particular motility disorder, extraocular
muscle function, and the degree of abnormal head position.

Follow-Up
Follow-up depends on the condition or conditions being treated.

8

AMBLYOPIA

Symptoms
Usually none. Usually found when decreased
vision is detected by vision testing in each
eye. A history of patching, strabismus, or muscle surgery as a child may be elicited.
NOTE: Amblyopia occasionally occurs bilaterally
as a result of bilateral visual deprivation (e.g., congenital cataracts not treated within the first months
of life).

Signs
Critical. Poorer vision in one eye that is not
improved with refraction and not entirely
explained by an organic lesion. The involved
eye nearly always has a higher refractive error.
The decrease in vision develops during the
first several years of life. Central vision is primarily affected, while the peripheral visual
field usually remains normal.

LWBK1000-C08_p177-203.indd 189

•

Other. Individual letters are more easily read
than a full line (crowding phenomenon). In
reduced illumination, the visual acuity of an
amblyopic eye is reduced much less than an
organically diseased eye (neutral-density filter
effect).
NOTE: Amblyopia, when severe, may cause a trace
relative afferent pupillary defect. Care must be taken
to be sure that the light is directed along the same
axis in each eye, particularly in patients with strabismus. Directing the light off-axis may result in a
false-positive result.

Etiology
 Strabismus: Most common form (along

with anisometropia). The eyes are misaligned. Vision is worse in the consistently
deviating, nonfixating eye. Strabismus can
lead to or be the result of amblyopia.

23/12/11 1:54 AM

Pediatrics

 Anisometropia: Most common form (along

with strabismus). A large difference in
refractive error (usually ≥1.50 diopters)
between the two eyes. Can be seen in cases
of eyelid hemangioma or congenital ptosis
inducing astigmatism.
 Media opacity: A unilateral cataract, cor-

neal scar, or PFV/PHPV may cause a preference for the other eye and thereby cause
amblyopia.
 Occlusion: Amblyopia that occurs in the

fellow eye as a result of too much patching
or excessive use of atropine. Prevented by
examining at appropriate intervals (1 week
per year of age), patching part-time, or
using the full cycloplegic refraction when
using atropine.

Work-Up
1. History: Eye problem in childhood, such as
misaligned eyes, patching, or muscle surgery?
2. Ocular examination to rule out an organic
cause for the reduced vision.

8

3. Cover–uncover test to evaluate eye alignment. See Appendix 3, Cover/Uncover and
Alternate Cover Tests.
4. Refraction; cycloplegic in children too
young to cooperate.

Treatment
1. Patients younger than 12 years:
—Appropriate spectacle correction (full
cycloplegic refraction or reduce the hyperopia in both eyes symmetrically ≥1.50 diopters). If vision remains reduced after period of
refractive adaptation (6 to 12 weeks), begin
patching or penalization of fellow eye.
—Patching: Patch the eye with better corrected vision 2 to 6 hours/day for 1 week per
year of age (e.g., 3 weeks for a 3-year-old),
with at least 1 hour of near activity. Adhesive
patches placed directly over the eye are most
effective. A patch can be worn over the glasses
as long as the child does not peek around the
patch. If a patch causes local irritation, use
tincture of benzoin on the skin before applying the patch and use warm water compresses
on the patch before removal.

LWBK1000-C08_p177-203.indd 190

—Penalization with atropine: Atropine
1% once daily (used with glasses) has been
shown to be equally effective as patching in
mild-to-moderate amblyopia (20/100 or better). If vision does not improve, the effect of
the atropine can be increased by removing
the hyperopic lens from the glasses of the
nonamblyopic eye. If the child is experiencing difficulty with school work with the
use of atropine, he/she can wear full hyperopic correction with a +2.50 bifocal during
school.
—Optical degradation: Use a high plus lens
(e.g., +9.00 diopters or an aphakic contact
lens) to blur the image. If the child is highly
myopic, may remove the minus lens from
the preferred eye.
• Continue patching until the vision is
equalized or shows no improvement
after three compliant cycles of patching.
If a recurrence of amblyopia is likely,
use part-time patching to maintain
improved vision.
• If occlusion amblyopia (a decrease in
vision in the patched eye) develops,
patch the opposite eye for a short period
(e.g., 1 day per year of age), and repeat
the examination.
—In strabismic amblyopia, delay strabismus surgery until the vision in the two
eyes is equal, or maximal vision has been
obtained in the amblyopic eye.
2. If treatment of amblyopia fails or patient
presents outside of treatment age range, protective glasses should be worn to prevent accidental injury to the nonamblyopic eye. Any
child who does not have vision improved to
at least 20/40 needs to wear eye protection
during sports (one-eyed athlete rule).
3. Treatment of media opacity: Remove the
media opacity and begin patching the nonamblyopic eye.
4. Treatment of anisometropic amblyopia:
Give the appropriate spectacle correction at
the youngest age possible. If vision remains
reduced after period of refractive adaptation (6 to 12 weeks), begin patching or
penalization of fellow eye.

the lens opacity often leads to angle-closure
glaucoma.

Other. A white fundus reflex (leukocoria),
absent red pupillary reflex, abnormal eye movements (nystagmus) in one or both eyes, and
strabismus. Infants with bilateral cataracts may
be noted to be visually inattentive. In patients
with a monocular cataract, the involved eye
may be smaller. A cataract alone does not cause
a relative afferent pupillary defect.

See 8.1, Leukocoria.

Etiology
 Idiopathic (most common).
 Familial, autosomal dominant.
 Galactosemia: Cataract may be the sole

manifestation when galactokinase deficiency is responsible. A deficiency of
galactose-1-phosphate uridyl transferase
may produce mental retardation and symptomatic cirrhosis along with cataracts. The
typical oil-droplet opacity may or may not
be seen. Cataract may be reversible with
appropriate dietary modifications.
 PFV/PHPV: Unilateral. The involved eye is

usually slightly smaller than the normal
fellow eye. Examination after pupil dilatation may reveal a plaque of fibrovascular

“salt-and-pepper” chorioretinitis, microphthalmos, corneal clouding, and poorly
dilating pupils. Glaucoma may occur with
congenital rubella but usually does not
occur in the presence of a rubella cataract.
Associated hearing defects and heart abnormalities are common.

renal disease, and mental retardation.
X-linked recessive. Patients’ mothers may
have small cataracts.
 Others: Chromosomal disorders, systemic

syndromes, other intrauterine infections,
trauma, drugs, other metabolic abnormalities, aniridia, anterior segment dysgenesis,
radiation.

8

Types
1. Zonular (lamellar): Most common type
of congenital cataract. White opacities
that surround the nucleus with alternating clear and white cortical lamella like an
onion skin.
2. Polar: Small opacities of the lens capsule
and adjacent cortex on the anterior or posterior pole of the lens. Anterior polar cataracts usually have little effect on vision
and tend to grow very little over time.
Posterior polar cataracts are variable and
may grow significantly, causing decreased
vision.
3. Nuclear: Opacity within the embryonic/
fetal nucleus.
4. Posterior lenticonus: A posterior protrusion,
usually opacified, in the posterior capsule.

exposure or trauma? Family history of congenital cataracts?
2. Visual assessment of each eye individually
by using techniques for non-verbal children (tumbling E’s, pictures, Teller cards, or
by following small toys or a light).

3. Ocular examination: Attempt to determine the visual significance of the cataract by evaluating the size and location of
the cataract and whether the retina can be
seen with a direct ophthalmoscope or retinoscope when looking through an undilated pupil. A blunted retinoscopic reflex
suggests the cataract is visually significant. Cataracts ≥3 mm in diameter usually but not always affect vision. Cataracts
≤3 mm may not be visually significant but
have been associated with amblyopia secondary to induced anisometropia. Check
for signs of associated glaucoma (see 8.11,
Congenital/Infantile Glaucoma) and examine the optic nerve and retina for abnormalities, if possible.
4. Cycloplegic refraction.
5. B-scan US may be helpful when the fundus
view is obscured.
6. Bilateral cataracts suggest a genetic or metabolic etiology; medical examination by a
pediatrician looking for associated abnormalities.
7. Red blood cell (RBC) galactokinase activity
(galactokinase levels) with or without RBC
galactose-1-phosphate uridyl transferase
activity to rule out galactosemia. The latter
test is performed routinely on all infants in
the United States as part of the newborn
screen.
8. Other tests as suggested by the systemic or
ocular examination. The chance that one
of these conditions is present in a healthy
child is remote.

LWBK1000-C08_p177-203.indd 192

—Urine: Amino acid quantitation (Alport
syndrome), amino acid content (Lowe syndrome).
—Antibody titers for rubella.

Treatment
1. Referral to a pediatrician to treat any
underlying disorder.
2. Treat associated ocular diseases.
3. Cataract extraction, usually within days to
weeks of discovery to prevent irreversible
amblyopia, is performed in the following
circumstances:
—Vision is obstructed, and the eye’s visual
development is at risk.
—Cataract progression threatens the health
of the eye (e.g., in PFV/PHPV).
4. After cataract extraction, treat amblyopia
(see 8.7, Amblyopia).
5. A dilating agent (e.g., phenylephrine 2.5%,
t.i.d., homatropine 2% t.i.d., or scopolamine
0.25% q.d.) may be used as a temporizing
measure, allowing peripheral light rays to
pass around the lens opacity and reach the
retina. This rarely is successful long term.
6. Unilateral cataracts that are not large
enough to obscure the visual axis and thus
require removal may still result in amblyopia. Treat amblyopia as above.

Follow-Up
1. Infants and young children who do not
undergo surgery are monitored closely for
cataract progression and amblyopia.
2. Amblyopia is less likely to develop in older
children even if the cataract progresses.
Therefore, this age group is followed less
frequently.
NOTE: Children with rubella must be isolated
from pregnant women.

 Nasolacrimal duct obstruction: See 8.10,

Congenital Nasolacrimal Duct Obstruction.
 Congenital glaucoma: See 8.11, Congenital/

Etiology
 Chemical: Seen within a few hours of instill-

ing a prophylactic agent (e.g., silver nitrate).
Lasts no more than 24 to 36 hours. Rarely
seen now that erythromycin is used routinely. Gentamicin should be avoided since
it may be associated with a toxic reaction.
 Neisseria gonorrhoeae: Usually seen within 3

to 4 days after birth. May present as mild
conjunctival hyperemia to severe chemosis, copious discharge, rapid corneal
ulceration, or corneal perforation. Gramnegative intracellular diplococci seen on
Gram stain.
 Chlamydia trachomatis: Usually presents

within first week or two of birth with mild
swelling, hyperemia, tearing, and primarily a mucoid discharge. May see basophilic
intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies in conjunctival epithelial cells, polymorphonuclear leukocytes, or lymphocytes on
Giemsa stain. Diagnosis usually made with
various molecular tests including immunoassay (e.g., ELISA, EIA, direct antibody
tests), PCR, or DNA-hybridization probe.

petic vesicles on the eyelid margins. Can see
multinucleated giant cells on Giemsa stain.

Work-Up
1. History: Previous or concurrent venereal
disease in the mother? Were cervical cultures performed during pregnancy?
2. Ocular examination with a penlight and
then a blue light after fluorescein instillation; look for corneal involvement.
3. Conjunctival scrapings for two slides: Gram
and Giemsa stain.
—Technique: Irrigate the discharge out of the
fornices, place a drop of topical anesthetic
(e.g., proparacaine) in the eye, and scrape
the palpebral conjunctiva of the lower eyelid
with a flame-sterilized spatula after it cools
off, or use a calcium alginate swab. Place the
scrapings on the slides.

8

4. Conjunctival cultures with blood and chocolate agars: Chocolate agar should be placed
in an atmosphere of 2% to 10% carbon
dioxide immediately after being plated.
—Technique: Anesthetize the eye. Moisten
a calcium alginate swab (a cotton-tipped
applicator is a less desirable alternative)
with liquid broth media and vigorously rub
it along the inferior palpebral conjunctiva.
Plate it directly on the culture dish. Repeat
for additional cultures.
5. Scrape the conjunctiva for the chlamydial
immunofluorescent antibody test or polymerase chain reaction, if available.
6. Viral culture: Moisten another cotton-tipped
applicator and roll it along the palpebral conjunctiva. Break off the end of the applicator
and place it into the viral transport medium.
7. Systemic evaluation by primary care provider.

Treatment
Initial therapy is based on the results of
the Gram and Giemsa stains if they can be

examined immediately. Therapy is then modified according to the culture results and the
clinical response.
1. No information from stains, no particular
organism suspected: Erythromycin ointment q.i.d. plus erythromycin elixir 50 mg/
kg/day in four divided doses for 2 to 3 weeks.
2. Suspect chemical (e.g., silver nitrate) toxicity: Discontinue offending agent. No treatment or preservative-free artificial tears q.i.d.
Reevaluate in 24 hours.
3. Suspect chlamydial infection: Erythromycin
elixir 50 mg/kg/day for 14 days, plus erythromycin ointment q.i.d. If confirmed by culture or immunofluorescent stain, treat the
mother and her sexual partners with one of
the following:

8

in addition to systemic antibiotics based on
the Gram stain as outlined below.
—Topical saline lavage q.i.d. to remove any
discharge.
—All neonates with gonorrhea should also
be treated for chlamydial infection with
erythromycin elixir 50 mg/kg/day in four
divided doses for 14 days.
NOTE: If confirmed by culture, the mother and
her sexual partners should be treated for 7 days.
If sensitivities are not initially available, ceftriaxone is the first choice. In addition, chlamydial
infection should be treated as outlined earlier.

5. Gram-positive bacteria with no suspicion
of gonorrhea and no corneal involvement:
Bacitracin ointment q.i.d. for 2 weeks.

—Tetracycline 250 to 500 mg p.o. q.i.d. or
doxycycline 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. for 7 days
(for mothers who are neither breast-feeding
nor pregnant, or for men) or azithromycin
1 g as a single dose or erythromycin 250
to 500 mg p.o. q.i.d. for 7 days (for breastfeeding or pregnant women).

6. Gram-negative bacteria with no suspicion
of gonorrhea and no corneal involvement:
Gentamicin, tobramycin, or ciprofloxacin
ointment q.i.d. for 2 weeks.

NOTE: Inadequately treated chlamydial conjunctivitis in a neonate can lead to chlamydial otitis
or pneumonia.

8. Suspect herpes simplex virus: The neonate,
regardless of the presenting ocular findings,
should be treated with acyclovir intravenously
as well as with vidarabine 3% ointment five
times per day, or trifluridine drops nine times
per day. Topical therapy is optional when
systemic therapy is instituted. In full-term
infants, the dosage for acyclovir is 45 to 60
mg/kg/day divided in three divided doses,
given intravenously for 14 days if limited to
the skin, eye, and mouth, and for 21 days if the
disease is disseminated or involves the central
nervous system. For children with recurrent
ocular lesions, oral suppressive therapy with
acyclovir (20 mg/kg q6h) may be of benefit.

4. Suspect N. gonorrhoeae:
—Saline irrigation of the conjunctiva and
fornices until discharge gone.
—Hospitalize and evaluate for disseminated
gonococcal infection with careful physical
examination (especially of joints). Blood
and cerebrospinal fluid cultures are obtained
if a culture-proven infection is present.
—Ceftriaxone 25 to 50 mg/kg intravenously (i.v.) or intramuscularly (i.m.) (not
to exceed 125 mg), as a single dose or cefotaxime 100 mg/kg i.v. or i.m. as a single
dose. In penicillin- or cephalosporin-allergic patients, an Infectious Disease consult is
obtained. Systemic antibiotics sufficiently
treat gonococcal conjunctivitis, and topical
antibiotics are not necessary.
—If diagnosis is unclear, bacitracin ointment or ciprofloxacin ointment can be used

LWBK1000-C08_p177-203.indd 194

7. Bacteria on Gram stain and corneal involvement: Hospitalize, work-up, and treat as
discussed in 4.11, Bacterial Keratitis.

Follow-Up
1. Initially, examine daily as an inpatient or
outpatient.
2. If the condition worsens (e.g., corneal
involvement develops), reculture and hospitalize. Therapy and follow-up are tailored
according to the clinical response and the
culture results.

Congenital Nasolacrimal Duct Obstruction

195

CONGENITAL NASOLACRIMAL DUCT
OBSTRUCTION

Signs

Work-Up

Critical. Wet-looking eye or tears flowing
over the eyelid; moist or dried mucopurulent
material on the eyelashes (predominantly
medially), and reflux of mucoid or mucopurulent material from the punctum when pressure is applied over the lacrimal sac (where the
lower eyelid abuts the nose). The eye is otherwise white. Symptoms usually appear in the
first 1 to 2 months of life.

1. Exclude other causes of tearing, particularly
congenital glaucoma. See 8.11, Congenital/
Infantile Glaucoma.

Other. Erythema of the surrounding skin;
redness and swelling of the medial canthus.
May become infected and occasionally spread
from the nasolacrimal duct, resulting in conjunctivitis. Therefore, recurrent conjunctivitis
may be another sign. Preseptal cellulitis or
dacryocystitis may rarely develop.

Differential Diagnosis
 Conjunctivitis: See 5.1, Acute Conjunctivi-

tis.
 Congenital anomalies of the upper lacri-

mal drainage system: Atresia of the lacrimal
puncta or canaliculus.
 Dacryocele:

Bluish, cystic, firm mass
located just below the medial canthal
angle. Caused by both a distal and proximal obstruction of the nasolacrimal apparatus. Most often presents within the first
week of life.

 Congenital glaucoma: Classic findings are

tearing, light sensitivity (possibly associated with blepharospasm), corneal clouding, and a large eye (buphthalmos). See
8.11, Congenital/Infantile Glaucoma.
 Other causes of tearing: Entropion/trichia-

sis, corneal defects, foreign body under the
upper eyelid.

2. Palpate over the lacrimal sac; reflux of
mucoid or mucopurulent discharge from
the punctum confirms the diagnosis.
May also use the dye disappearance test.
Place fluorescein in both eyes. Check in
10 minutes; fluorescein will remain in the
eye with congenital nasolacrimal duct obstruction.

Treatment
1. Digital pressure to lacrimal sac q.i.d. The
parent is taught to place his or her index
finger over the child’s common canaliculus
(inner corner of the eye) and to apply pressure in a downward fashion.
2. Topical antibiotic (e.g., polymyxin/trimethoprim q.i.d.) as needed to control mucopurulent discharge if present.
3. In the presence of acute dacryocystitis (red,
swollen lacrimal sac), a systemic antibiotic
is needed. See 6.9, Dacryocystitis/Inflammation
of the Lacrimal Sac.
4. Most cases open spontaneously with this
regimen by 1 year of age. Probing should
be considered if the nasolacrimal duct obstruction persists beyond a year of age.
Probe earlier if recurrent or persistent infections of the lacrimal system develop, or at
the request of the parents. Most obstructions are corrected after the initial probing;
others may require repeated probings. If
primary and secondary probing fails, may
use balloon dacryoplasty or silicone tubing
in the nasolacrimal duct that is left in place
for weeks to months. Consider dacryocystorhinostomy as a last resort.

Etiology

Follow-Up

Usually the result of a congenitally imperforate membrane at the distal end of the nasolacrimal duct over the valve of Hasner.

Routine follow-up unless surgery is indicated,
sooner if the situation worsens or acute dacryocystitis is present.

CONGENITAL/INFANTILE GLAUCOMA

Signs
(See Figure 8.11.1.)
Critical. Enlarged globe and corneal diameter (horizontal corneal diameter >12 mm
before 1 year of age is suggestive), corneal
edema, Haab striae (linear tears in Descemet
membrane of the cornea, running in any
direction with scalloped edges with or without associated stromal haze), increased cup/
disc ratio, axial myopia, commonly bilateral
(80%). Classic findings are tearing, photophobia, blepharospasm, corneal clouding, and a
large eye (buphthalmos).
Other. Corneal stromal scarring (opacification); IOP may or may not be elevated, high
iris insertion on gonioscopy, and may have
other signs of iris dysgenesis, including heterochromia.

8

Differential Diagnosis
 Congenital megalocornea: Bilateral hori-

zontal corneal diameter usually >14 mm,
with normal corneal thickness and endothelium, IOP, and cup/disc ratio. Radial
iris transillumination defects may be seen.
Usually X-linked recessive (boys affected,
female carriers may have above normal
corneal diameters) and may be associated
with developmental delay (Neuhauser syndrome, autosomal recessive).
 Trauma from forceps during delivery: May

produce tears in the Descemet membrane
and localized corneal edema; tears are

typically vertical or oblique, and the corneal diameter is normal. Always unilateral,
must have history of forceps use to make
diagnosis.
 Congenital hereditary endothelial dystro-

phy: Bilateral full-thickness corneal edema
at birth with a normal corneal diameter
and axial length, IOP may be artifactiously
elevated by increased corneal thickness and
hysteresis but true associated infantile glaucoma has been reported. See 4.26, Corneal
Dystrophies.
 Posterior polymorphous dystrophy: Can

present in infancy as bilateral but asymmetric cloudy edematous corneas with characteristic endothelial abnormalities. Normal
corneal diameter, axial length, and IOP.
Abnormal endothelium may be seen in one
parent.
 Mucopolysaccharidoses

and cystinosis:
Some inborn errors of metabolism produce
cloudy corneas in infancy or early childhood, usually not at birth; the corneal
diameter and axial length are normal, IOP
is rarely elevated and, if so, usually later in
childhood. Always bilateral.

 Nasolacrimal duct obstruction: No photo-

phobia, clear cornea, normal corneal size
and axial length, normal IOP. See 8.10,
Congenital Nasolacrimal Duct Obstruction.
 Large eye without other signs of glaucoma

can be seen in overgrowth syndromes (e.g.,
hemihypertrophy) and phakomatoses (e.g.,
neurofibromatosis, Sturge–Weber) in the
absence of glaucoma. May also be autosomal dominant variant without glaucoma.

Etiology

Common
 Primary congenital glaucoma: Not associated
with other ocular or systemic disorders. Diagnosed after other causes of glaucoma have
been ruled out. Caused by incomplete differentiation of the trabecular meshwork during
embryogenesis (e.g., goniodysgenesis).

23/12/11 1:54 AM

8.11

 Aphakic glaucoma: Most common form of

pediatric glaucoma. Typically in older children. All children undergoing cataract surgery are at lifelong risk.
Less Common
 Sturge–Weber syndrome: Usually unilateral

(90%); ipsilateral port-wine mark almost
always involving lid(s), cerebral calcifications/atrophy, and seizures/developmental
delay (central nervous system may not be
involved at all); not familial. See 13.13,
Phakomatoses.
Rare
 Other anterior segment dysgeneses: Axen-

feld–Rieger spectrum, Peters anomaly, others. See 8.12, Developmental Anterior Segment
and Lens Anomalies/Dysgenesis.
 Lowe

syndrome (oculocerebrorenal syndrome): Cataract, glaucoma, developmental
delay, and renal disease; X-linked recessive.

 Congenital rubella: Glaucoma, cataract,

“salt-and-pepper” retinopathy, hearing
and cardiac defects (usually peripheral pulmonic stenosis).
 Aniridia: Absence of almost all of the iris,

often with only a rudimentary iris stub visible on gonioscopy, cataracts, glaucoma,
macular hypoplasia, nystagmus. See 8.12,
Developmental Anterior Segment and Lens
Anomalies/Dysgenesis.
 Others:

Neurofibromatosis, PFV/PHPV,
Weill–Marchesani syndrome, Rubinstein–
Taybi syndrome, covert trauma, steroidinduced infantile glaucoma, and others.

Work-Up
1. History: Other systemic abnormalities?
Rubella infection during pregnancy? Birth
trauma? Family history of congenital glaucoma?
2. Ocular examination, including a visual acuity assessment of each eye separately, a slitlamp or portable slit-lamp examination to
detect corneal edema and measure corneal
diameter. Retinoscopy to estimate refractive
error, or A-scan to measure axial length. A
dilated fundus examination is performed to

LWBK1000-C08_p177-203.indd 197

•

Congenital/Infantile Glaucoma

197

evaluate the optic disc and retina if able to
view through cornea.
3. EUA is performed in suggestive cases and
in those for whom surgical treatment is
considered. The horizontal corneal diameter (measured with calipers or templates), IOP measurement, pachymetry,
retinoscopy, gonioscopy, and ophthalmoscopy are performed. Axial length
is measured with US. At 40 gestational
weeks, the mean axial length is 17 mm.
This increases to 20 mm on average by
age 1 year. Axial length progression may
also be monitored by successive cycloplegic refractions or serial US. Disc photos
may also be taken.
NOTE: IOP may be reduced minimally by general anesthesia, particularly halothane, corneal
epithelial edema, and overventilation (low
end-tidal CO2); ketamine hydrochloride, succinylcholine, endotracheal intubation (for 2 to
5 minutes), pressure from the anesthetic mask,
speculum use, or inadequate ventilation with
elevated end-tidal CO2, may falsely increase IOP.

8

Treatment
Definitive treatment is usually surgical. Medical therapy is utilized as a temporizing measure before surgery and to help clear the
cornea in preparation for possible goniotomy.
1. Medical:
—Oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitor (e.g.,
acetazolamide, 15 to 30 mg/kg/day in three
or four divided doses): Most effective.
—Topical carbonic anhydrase inhibitor
(e.g., dorzolamide or brinzolamide b.i.d.):
Less effective; better tolerated.
—Topical beta-blocker (e.g., levobunolol
or timolol, 0.25% if <1 year old or 0.5% if
older b.i.d.).
—Prostaglandin analogs (e.g., latanoprost
q.h.s.)
NOTE: Brimonidine is contraindicated in children under the age of 1 year because of the risk
of apnea/hypotension/bradycardia/hypothermia.
Caution should be used in children under 5 years
old or <20 kg.

Pediatrics

2. Surgical: Nasal goniotomy (incising the
trabecular meshwork with a blade or needle under gonioscopic visualization) is
the procedure of choice, although some
surgeons initially recommend trabeculotomy. Miotics are sometimes used to
constrict the pupil before a surgical goniotomy. If the cornea is not clear, trabeculotomy (opening the Schlemm canal
from a scleral approach into the anterior
chamber) or endoscopic goniotomy can
be performed. If the initial goniotomy is
unsuccessful, a temporal goniotomy may
be tried. Trabeculectomy or tube shunt
may be performed following failed angleincision operations.

8.12
8

NOTE: Amblyopia is the most common cause of
visual loss in pediatric glaucoma and should be
treated appropriately. See 8.7, Amblyopia.

Follow-Up
1. Repeated examinations, under anesthesia
as needed, to monitor corneal diameter and
clarity, IOP, cup/disc ratio, and refraction/
axial length.
2. These patients must be followed throughout life to monitor for progression.
3. Other forms of pediatric glaucoma in older
children include uveitic glaucoma, traumatic
glaucoma, juvenile open-angle glaucoma
(JOAG, autosomal dominant), and others.

DEVELOPMENTAL ANTERIOR SEGMENT
AND LENS ANOMALIES/DYSGENESIS

Unilateral or bilateral congenital abnormalities of the cornea, iris, anterior chamber angle,
and lens.

 Microcornea: Horizontal corneal diameter

small for age. May be isolated or associated
with microphthalmia, cataract, or nanophthalmos.
 Posterior

embryotoxon: A prominent,
anteriorly displaced Schwalbe ring. May be
normal, or seen in association with Axenfeld–Rieger and Alagille syndrome.

defects, deafness, and mental retardation
may be seen (see Figure 8.12.1).
 Peters anomaly: Failure of the lens to com-

pletely detach from surface epithelium
during 4 to 7 weeks of gestation. Central
corneal opacity, usually with iris strands
that extend from the collarette to a posterior corneal defect behind the scar. The
lens may be clear and normally positioned,
cataractous and displaced anteriorly (making the anterior chamber shallow), or
adherent to the corneal defect. “Peters
plus” syndrome is characterized by an

 Axenfeld–Rieger spectrum: Ranges from

posterior embryotoxon associated with
iris strands from the periphery that span
the angle to insert into the prominent

of patients. Usually autosomal dominant. May be associated with abnormal
teeth (e.g., microdontia, conical teeth,
hypodontia), skeletal abnormalities, and
redundancy of the periumbilical skin.

stature. Other malformations may also be
seen (see Figure 8.12.2).
 Microspherophakia: The lens is small and

spherical in configuration. It can subluxate
into the anterior chamber, causing a secondary glaucoma. Can be isolated or seen
in association with Weill–Marchesani syndrome (see Figure 8.12.3).
 Anterior and posterior lenticonus: An ante-

rior or posterior ectasia of the lens surface,
posterior occurring more commonly than
anterior. Often associated with cataract.

the iris. Glaucoma, macular hypoplasia
with poor vision, nystagmus, refractive
error, and corneal pannus are common.
May be part of a pan-ocular disorder due
to mutations in the master control gene of
the eye, PAX6. If PAX6 is deleted as part of
a larger chromosomal deletion it is called
WAGR syndrome (Wilms tumor, aniridia,
genital abnormalities, retardation). More
common in sporadic aniridia. Aniridia
is autosomal dominant in two-thirds of
patients, a type usually not associated with
Wilms tumor.
 Sclerocornea: Nonprogressive scleraliza-

tion of the cornea. Unilateral or bilateral.
May be mild and peripheral or severe and
diffuse. Associated with severe anterior
segment dysgenesis and risk for glaucoma. Often associated with microphthalmia.

8

 Primary aphakia: Failure of lens develop-

ment. Usually associated with microphthalmia and severe intraocular dysgenesis
including retinal dysplasia and corneal opacity. High risk for glaucoma.

Work-Up
1. History: Family history of ocular disease?
Associated systemic abnormalities?
2. Complete ophthalmic examination, including gonioscopy of the anterior chamber
angle and IOP determination (may require
EUA).
3. Complete physical examination by a primary care physician.

involving Wilms tumor gene is found, the
frequency of ultrasound should be every
3 months.

Treatment
1. Correct refractive errors and treat amblyopia if present (see 8.7, Amblyopia). Children
with unilateral structural abnormalities
often have improved visual acuity after
amblyopia therapy.
2. Treat glaucoma if present. Beta-blockers,
prostaglandin analogs, and carbonic anhydrase inhibitors may be used. Pilocarpine is
not effective and is not used in primary therapy (see 9.1, Primary Open-Angle Glaucoma).

8.13
Critical.

3. Consider cataract extraction if a significant
cataract exists and a corneal transplant if a
dense corneal opacity exists.
4. Provide genetic counseling.
5. Systemic abnormalities (e.g., Wilms tumor)
are managed by pediatric specialists.

Follow-Up
1. Ophthalmic examination every 6 months
throughout life, checking for increased IOP
and other signs of glaucoma.
2. If amblyopia exists, follow-up may need to
be more frequent (see 8.7, Amblyopia).

CONGENITAL PTOSIS

Signs

8

Surgery is often used initially (see 8.11,
Congenital/Infantile Glaucoma).

Droopy eyelid(s).

Other. Amblyopia, strabismus, telecanthus.
In unilateral ptosis, the involved eye may not
open for the first several days.

Differential Diagnosis
 Simple

congenital ptosis: Either unilateral or bilateral. Present at birth and
stable throughout life. May have indistinct or absent upper eyelid crease. Ptosis improves with downgaze. Involved
side may be higher than normal eyelid in
downgaze because of levator fibrosis. May
have compensatory brow elevation or
chin-up head position. Coexisting motility abnormality if from a third cranial
nerve palsy.

—Type III: Telecanthus, ptosis, and present
epicanthal folds. May also have flattened
nasal bridge and low-set ears.
 Marcus Gunn jaw winking: Usually unilat-

eral. Upper eyelid movement with contraction of muscles of mastication, resulting
in “winking” while chewing. Upper eyelid
crease intact. The ptosis may range from
none to severe, but with mastication the
levator may lift the lid several millimeters
above the limbus.
 Acquired ptosis: See 6.1, Ptosis.
 Horner syndrome: Usually unilateral. Typi-

cally 2 to 3 mm of ptosis, associated with
anisocoria (see 10.2, Horner Syndrome). May
be congenital (associated with iris heterochromia) or acquired. Acquired forms in children may be related to birth trauma, chest/
neck trauma, or metastatic neuroblastoma.

 Blepharophimosis syndrome: Blepharophi-

mosis, telecanthus, epicanthal folds, and ptosis. Bilateral and severe. Autosomal dominant
with high penetrance (see Figure 8.13.1).
—Type I: All four eyelids phimotic with
upper eyelid ptosis.
—Type II: Telecanthus, ptosis, and absent
epicanthal folds.

 Pseudoptosis: Dermatochalasis, contralat-

eral proptosis, enophthalmos, hypotropia.
See 6.1, Ptosis.

Etiology
Defective function of either the levator or
Müller neuromuscular complexes.

Work-Up
1. History: Age of onset? Duration? Family
history? History of trauma or prior surgery?
Any crossing of eyes?
2. Visual acuity for each eye separately, with
correction, to evaluate for amblyopia.
3. Manifest and cycloplegic refraction checking for anisometropia.
4. Pupillary examination.
5. Ocular motility examination.
6. Measure interpalpebral fissure distance,
distance between corneal light reflex and
upper eyelid margin, levator function
(while manually fixing eyebrow), position
and depth of upper eyelid crease. Check for
Bell phenomenon.
7. Slit-lamp examination; look for signs of
corneal exposure.
8. Dilated fundus examination.
9. If Horner syndrome is suspected, refer to
pediatrician for systemic evaluation.

The Bilaterally Blind Infant

201

Treatment
1. Observation if degree of ptosis mild, no evidence of amblyopia, and no abnormal head
positioning.
2. Simple congenital ptosis: If levator function is poor, consider a frontalis suspension. If levator function is moderate or normal, consider a levator resection.
3. Blepharophimosis syndrome: Ptosis must
be repaired by frontalis suspension because
of poor levator function. Telecanthus often
gets better with time as the head grows and
the bridge of the nose grows forward. If
the telecanthus is severe, it may be treated
with surgery.
4. Marcus Gunn jaw winking: No treatment if
mild. In general, the jaw winking gets better around school age. Any treatment for
ptosis with levator resection will increase
the excursion during jaw winking.

Follow-Up
1. If observing, patients should be reexamined every 3 to 12 months, depending on
severity and age, to monitor for occlusion
or anisometropic amblyopia.

8

2. After surgery, patients should be monitored
for undercorrection or overcorrection and
recurrence. Exposure keratopathy may be a
significant problem after ptosis surgery.

THE BILATERALLY BLIND INFANT

Signs
Searching, roving movements of the eyes starting at about 4 to 6 weeks of age. Poor pupillary constriction to light in infants >31 weeks
gestation is a key finding. Inability to fix or
follow large, bright objects after 4 months corrected age.

 Dense

bilateral cataracts in children
>8 weeks of age. See 8.8, Congenital Cataract.

 Aniridia and other severe anterior segment

dysgenesis. See 8.12, Developmental Anterior
Segment and Lens Anomalies/Dysgenesis.
 Albinism: Iris transillumination defects and

foveal hypoplasia. See 13.8, Albinism.

Pediatrics

 Optic nerve hypoplasia: Small optic discs

can be difficult to detect when bilateral.
When present, a “double-ring” sign (a pigmented ring at the inner and outer edge of
a peripapillary scleral ring) is diagnostic. If
unilateral, may be seen with strabismus, a
relative afferent pupillary defect, and unilateral poor fixation instead of searching
nystagmus. Usually idiopathic.
NOTE: Bilateral optic nerve hypoplasia is occasionally associated with septooptic dysplasia (de
Morsier syndrome). In contrast, unilateral optic
nerve hypoplasia is only rarely associated with
this syndrome. De Morsier syndrome includes
midline abnormalities of the brain and growth,
thyroid, and other trophic hormone deficiencies.
Growth retardation, seizures as a result of hypoglycemia, and diabetes insipidus may develop. If
bilateral optic nerve hypoplasia is present, obtain
an MRI with attention to the hypothalamic-pituitary area. If unilateral optic nerve hypoplasia is
present, imaging studies may be considered as
clinically relevant.

8

 Congenital optic atrophy: Rare. Pale, normal-

fundus initially, but by childhood ocular
exam reveals narrowing of retinal blood
vessels, optic disc pallor, and pigmentary
changes. ERG is markedly abnormal or flat
which makes diagnosis. Autosomal recessive.
 Congenital

stationary night blindness:
Visual acuity may be close to normal,
nystagmus less common, associated with
myopia. ERG is abnormal. Autosomal dominant, recessive, and X-linked forms exist.
Often have paradoxical pupillary response
(pupillary constriction in dim light after
exposure to bright light). Retinal pigmentary abnormalities are seen in some types
of congenital stationary night blindness.

 Achromatopsia

(rod monochromatism):
Vision is in the 20/200 range. Marked photophobia. Pupils react normally to light but
may have paradoxical pupil response. Normal fundus, but photopic ERG is markedly
attenuated. Absence of response to flicker
light stimulus (25 Hz) is diagnostic. Scotopic ERG is normal.

not respond to sound or touch and are neurologically abnormal. Vision may slowly
improve with time.

 Extreme refractive error: Diagnosed on

cycloplegic refraction.
 Congenital motor nystagmus: Patients with

this condition usually have a mild visual
deficit (20/60 or better). Binocular conjugate
horizontal nystagmus. More than one type
of nystagmus may be present, including jerk,
pendular, circular, or elliptical. Patients may
adopt a face turn to maximize gaze in the
direction of the null point. No associated
central nervous system abnormalities exist.

Etiologies With a Normal Ocular Exam
 Leber

congenital amaurosis: Rod–cone
disorder. May have a normal-appearing

able. There is a normal ocular exam, but
there is underlying neurologic deficiency
causing decreased visual responses.

 Delayed maturation of the visual system:

Normal response to sound and touch and
neurologically normal. The ERG is normal,
and vision usually develops between age 4
and 12 months. More common in patients
with some type of albinism (may have nystagmus at presentation).

Work-Up
1. History: Premature? Normal development
and growth? Maternal infection, diabetes,
or drug use during pregnancy? Seizures or
other neurologic deficits? Family history
of eye disease?
2. Evaluate the infant’s ability to fixate on
an object and follow it.

10. Consider a sweep visual-evoked potential
for vision measurement.

4. Look carefully for nystagmus (see 10.21,
Nystagmus).

11. Consider eye movement recordings to
evaluate the nystagmus wave form, if
available.

5. Examination of the anterior segment;
check especially for iris transillumination defects.
6. Dilated retinal and optic nerve evaluation.
7. Cycloplegic refraction.
8. ERG, especially if Leber congenital amaurosis is suspected.
9. Consider a CT scan or MRI of the brain
in cases with other focal neurologic signs,
seizures, failure to thrive, developmental
delay, optic nerve hypoplasia, or neurologically localizing nystagmus (e.g., seesaw, vertical, gaze paretic, vestibular). If
optic atrophy, either unilateral or bilateral, is present, obtain an MRI to evaluate
for a glioma of the optic nerve or chiasm
and craniopharyngioma.

Treatment
1. Correct refractive errors and treat known or
suspected amblyopia.
2. Parental counseling is necessary in all of
these conditions with respect to the infant’s
visual potential and the likelihood of visual
problems in siblings, etc.
3. Referral to educational services for the visually handicapped or blind may be helpful.
4. Provide genetic counseling.
5. If neurologic or endocrine abnormalities
are found or suspected, the child should
be referred to a pediatrician for appropriate
work-up and management.

Glaucoma

9.1

PRIMARY OPEN-ANGLE GLAUCOMA

Symptoms
Usually asymptomatic until the later stages. Early
symptoms may include parts of a page missing.
Tunnel vision and loss of central fixation typically do not occur until late in the disease.

Signs
 Intraocular pressure (IOP): Although most

patients will have an elevated IOP (normal
range of 10 to 21 mm Hg), nearly half have
an IOP of 21 mm Hg or lower at any one
screening.
 Gonioscopy: Normal-appearing, open ante-

rior chamber angle on gonioscopic evaluation. No peripheral anterior synechiae
(PAS).
 Optic nerve: See Figure 9.1.1. Characteris-

tic appearance includes loss of rim tissue

(includes notching; increased narrowing
superiorly, inferiorly, or nasally more than
temporally; progressive narrowing over
time), regional pallor, splinter or nerve fiber
layer hemorrhage that crosses the disc margin (Drance hemorrhage), acquired pit, nerve
fiber layer defect, cup/disc (C/D) asymmetry
>0.2 in the absence of a cause (e.g., anisometropia, different nerve sizes), bayoneting
(sharp angulation of the blood vessels as they
exit the nerve), enlarged C/D ratio (>0.6; less
specific), progressive enlargement of the cup,
greater Disc Damage Likelihood Scale (DDLS)
score (see Figure 9.1.2).
 Visual fields: Characteristic visual field

loss includes nasal step, paracentral scotoma, arcuate scotoma extending from the
blind spot nasally (defects usually respect
the horizontal midline or are greater in
one hemifield than the other), altitudinal
defect, or generalized depression (see Figure
9.1.3).
Other. Large fluctuations in IOP, absence of
microcystic corneal edema, an uninflamed eye.

Differential Diagnosis
If Anterior Chamber Angle Open on Gonioscopy:

large optic nerve (> about 2 mm). Often
familial.
 Secondary open-angle glaucoma: Identifi-

able cause for open-angle glaucoma including lens-induced, inflammatory, exfoliative,
pigmentary, steroid-induced, angle recession, traumatic (as a result of direct injury,
blood, or debris), and glaucoma related to
increased episcleral venous pressure (e.g.,
Sturge–Weber syndrome, carotid–cavernous fistula), intraocular tumors, degenerated red blood cells (ghost cell glaucoma),
degenerated photoreceptor outer segments
following chronic rhegmatogenous retinal
detachment (Schwartz–Matsuo syndrome),
or developmental anterior segment abnormalities. See specific sections.
 Low-pressure glaucoma: Same as primary

open-angle glaucoma (POAG) except normal IOP. See 9.2, Low-Pressure Primary
Open-Angle Glaucoma (Normal Pressure Glaucoma).
 Previous glaucomatous damage (e.g., from

steroids, uveitis, glaucomatocyclitic crisis,

LWBK1000-C09_p204-241.indd 205

trauma) in which the inciting agent has
been removed. Nerve appearance now
static.

9

 Optic atrophy: Characterized by dispro-

portionally more optic nerve pallor than
cupping. IOP usually normal unless a secondary or unrelated glaucoma is present.
Color vision and central vision are often
decreased. Causes include optic nerve, chiasmal, or tract tumors, syphilis, ischemic
optic neuropathy, drugs, retinal vascular
or degenerative disease, others. Visual field
defects that respect the vertical midline are
typical of intracranial lesions at or posterior
to the chiasm.
 Congenital optic nerve defects (e.g., tilted

discs, colobomas, optic nerve pits): Visual
field defects may be present but are static.
 Optic nerve drusen: Optic nerves not usu-

ally cupped and drusen often visible. Visual
field defects may remain stable or progress
unrelated to IOP. The most frequent defects
include arcuate defects or an enlarged blind
spot. Characteristic calcified lesions can be

Work-Up
1. History: Presence of risk factors (family history of blindness or visual loss from glaucoma, older age, African descent, diabetes,
myopia, hypertension or hypotension)?
Previous history of increased IOP or chronic
steroid use? Refractive surgery including
laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) in past

(change in pachymetry)? Review of past
medical history to determine appropriate
therapy including asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), congestive
heart failure, heart block or bradyarrythmia, renal stones, allergies?

• Visual field defects greater than expected
based on amount of cupping.

2. Baseline glaucoma evaluation: All patients
with suspected glaucoma of any type
should have the following:

• IOP within the average range (<21 mm
Hg) or symmetric between both eyes.

—Complete ocular examination including
visual acuity, pupillary assessment for a relative afferent pupillary defect, confrontational
visual fields using a red object (e.g., red top
of a mydriatic drop), slit-lamp examination,
applanation tonometry, gonioscopy, and
dilated fundus examination (if the angle is
open) with special attention to the optic
nerve.
—Baseline documentation of the optic
nerves (e.g., stereoscopic disc photos,
red-free photographs, computerized image
analysis [e.g., optical coherence tomography (OCT) or Heidelberg retina tomography (HRT)], or meticulous drawings) and
formal visual field testing (preferably automated, e.g., Humphrey). Goldmann visual
field tests may be helpful in patients unable
to take the automated tests adequately.
Color vision testing indicated in those suspected of a neurologic disorder (see Figure
9.1.4).
—Measure central corneal thickness (CCT).
Corneal thickness variations affect apparent
IOP as measured with applanation tonometry. Average corneal thickness is 530 to 545
microns. Thinner corneas tend to underestimate IOP, whereas thicker corneas tend to
overestimate IOP, although the relationship
between corneal thickness and measured
IOP is not exactly linear. A thin CCT is an
independent risk factor for the development of POAG.

• Visual field patterns not typical of glaucoma (e.g., defects respecting the vertical
midline, hemianopic defects, enlarged
blind spot, central scotoma).

• Unilateral progression despite equal IOP
in both eyes.
• Decreased visual acuity out of proportion
to the amount of cupping or field loss.
• Color vision loss, especially in the red–
green axis.
If any of these are present, further evaluation may include:
• History: Acute episodes of eye pain
or redness? Steroid use? Acute visual
loss? Ocular trauma? Surgery, systemic
trauma, heart attack, dialysis, or other
event that may lead to hypotension?
• Diurnal IOP curve consisting of multiple IOP checks during the course of the
day.
• Consider other laboratory work-up for
nonglaucomatous optic neuropathy:
heavy metals, angiotensin-converting
enzyme, vitamin B12/folate, rapid plasma
reagin, fluorescent treponemal antibody
absorption, Lyme titer, antinuclear antibody. If giant cell arteritis (GCA) is a
consideration, then check erythrocyte
sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein,
and complete blood count (CBC) with
platelets [see 10.17, Arteritic Ischemic Optic
Neuropathy (Giant Cell Arteritis)].

—Further evaluation for other causes of
optic nerve damage should be considered
when any of the following atypical features
are present:

• In cases where a neurologic disorder is
suspected, obtain magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) of the brain and orbits
with gadolinium and fat suppression if
no contraindications are present or CT of
the head and orbits with axial and coronal views, preferably with contrast if no
contraindications are present.

• Optic nerve pallor out of proportion to
the degree of cupping.

• Check blood pressure, fasting blood
sugar, lipid panel, and CBC (screening

Treatment
General Considerations
1. Who to treat?
The decision to treat must be individualized. Some general guidelines are suggested.
Is the glaucomatous process present?
Damage is present if the DDLS score is >5,
there is visual field loss, there is the pres-

LWBK1000-C09_p204-241.indd 208

ence of an acquired pit or notched rims
(irregularity of rims >0.1 rim-to-disc for
<2 clock hours), IOP higher than 34 mm
Hg, IOP asymmetry more than 10 mm Hg,
or disc is <1.5 mm with a cup-to-disc of
>0.3.
Is the glaucomatous process active?
Determine the rate of damage progression by
careful follow-up. Certain causes of cupping
may be static (e.g., prior steroid response).
Disc hemorrhages suggest active disease.

22/12/11 12:30 AM

9.1

Is the glaucomatous process likely to
cause disability?
Consider the patient’s age, overall physical
and social health, as well as an estimation
of his or her life expectancy.
2. What is the treatment goal?
The goal of treatment is to enhance or
maintain the patient’s health by halting
optic nerve damage while avoiding undue
side effects of treatment. The only proven
method of stopping or slowing optic nerve
damage is reducing IOP. Reduction of IOP
by at least 30% appears to have the best
chance of preventing optic nerve damage.
An optimal goal may be to reduce the IOP
at least 30% below the threshold of progression. If damage is severe, greater reduction
in IOP may be necessary.
3. How to treat?
The main treatment options for glaucoma
include medications, laser trabeculoplasty
[both argon (ALT) and selective (SLT)], and
guarded filtration surgery (e.g., trabeculectomy). Typically, medications are first-line
therapy. Often ALT and SLT are also appropriate initial therapies, especially in patients
at risk for poor compliance, with medication side effects, and who have significant
posterior trabecular meshwork pigmentation. Surgery may be appropriate initial
treatment if damage is advanced in the setting of a rapid rate of progression or difficult
follow-up.
Additional treatment modalities, such as
tube-shunt procedures, laser cyclophotocoagulation of the ciliary body [with yttrium
aluminum garnet (YAG) laser, diode laser,
or endolaser], cyclocryotherapy, and cyclodialysis, are typically reserved for IOP
uncontrolled by other methods. Some surgeons, however, now use tube-shunt procedures as initial surgery. Other early surgical
options include canaloplasty, deep sclerectomy, and trabectome trabecular ablation.
Medications
Unless there are extreme circumstances (e.g.,
IOP >40 mm Hg or impending loss of central
fixation), treatment is started by using one

type of drop in one eye (monocular therapeutic trial) with reexamination in 3 to 6 weeks to
check for effectiveness.
—Prostaglandin agonists (e.g., latanoprost
0.005% q.h.s., bimatoprost 0.03% q.h.s.,
travoprost 0.004% q.h.s.) are to be used
with caution in patients with active uveitis
or cystoid macular edema (CME) and are
contraindicated in pregnant women or in
women wishing to become pregnant. Inform
patients of potential pigment changes in iris
and periorbital skin, as well as hypertrichosis of eyelashes. Iris pigment changes rarely
occur in blue or dark brown eyes. Those at
highest risk for irreversible iris hyperpigmentation are hazel, grey irides.
—Beta-blockers (e.g., levobunolol or timolol 0.25% to 0.5% q.d. or b.i.d.) should be
avoided in patients with asthma, COPD,
heart block, bradyarrythmia, unstable congestive heart failure, depression, or myasthenia gravis. In addition to bronchospasm
and bradycardia, other side effects include
hypotension, decreased libido, CNS depression, and reduced exercise tolerance.
—Selective a2-receptor agonists (brimonidine 0.1%, 0.15%, or 0.2% t.i.d. or b.i.d.) are
contraindicated in patients taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors (risk of hypertensive crisis) and relatively contraindicated in
children under the age of 5 (risk for cardiorespiratory and CNS depression). See 8.11,
Congenital/Infantile Glaucoma. Apraclonidine may be used for short-term therapy
(3 months), but tends to lose its effectiveness and has a high allergy rate.

9

—Topical carbonic anhydrase inhibitors
(CAIs) (e.g., dorzolamide 2% or brinzolamide
1% t.i.d. or b.i.d.) should be avoided, but
are not contraindicated, in patients with
sulfa allergy. These medications theoretically
could cause the same side effects as systemic
CAIs, such as metabolic acidosis, hypokalemia, gastrointestinal symptoms, weight loss,
paresthesias, and aplastic anemia. However,
systemic symptoms from topical CAIs are
extremely rare. There have been no reported
cases of aplastic anemia from topical use.

less tissue damage, which has led to the suggestion that it may be repeatable. This has not
been proven.

—Miotics (e.g., pilocarpine q.i.d.) are usually
used in low strengths initially (e.g., 0.5% to
1.0%) and then built up to higher strengths
(e.g., 4%). Commonly not tolerated in
patients <40 years because of accommodative
spasm. Miotics are usually contraindicated
in patients with retinal holes and should be
used cautiously in patients at risk for retinal
detachment (e.g., high myopes and aphakes).

Guarded Filtration Surgery
Trabeculectomy may obviate the need for
medications. Adjunctive use of antimetabolites (e.g., mitomycin-C, 5-fluorouracil) may
aid in the effectiveness of the surgery but
increases the risk of complications (e.g., bleb
leaks and hypotony).

—Sympathomimetics (dipivefrin 0.1% b.i.d.
or epinephrine 0.5% to 2.0% b.i.d.) rarely
reduce IOP to the degree of the other drugs,
but have few systemic side effects (rarely, cardiac arrhythmias). They often cause red eyes
and may cause CME in aphakic patients.

9

—Systemic CAIs (e.g., methazolamide 25 to 50
mg p.o. b.i.d. to t.i.d., acetazolamide 125 to
250 mg p.o. b.i.d. to q.i.d., or acetazolamide
500 mg sequel p.o. b.i.d.) should usually
not be given to patients with a sulfa allergy
or renal failure. Potassium levels must be
monitored if the patient is taking other
diuretic agents or digitalis. Side effects such
as fatigue, nausea, confusion, and paresthesias are common. Rare, but severe, hematologic side effects (e.g., aplastic anemia) and
Stevens–Johnson syndrome have occurred.
NOTE: Every patient should be instructed to
press a tissue into the inner canthus to occlude
the punctum for 10 seconds after instilling a
drop. Doing so will decrease systemic absorption and reduce allergic blepharitis. If unable to
perform punctal occlusion, keeping the eyelids
closed without blinking for 3 minutes after drop
administration also reduces systemic absorption.

Follow-Up
1. Patients are reexamined 4 to 6 weeks after
starting a new b-blocker or prostaglandin
or after ALT/SLT to evaluate efficacy. Topical CAIs, a-agonists, and miotics quickly
reach a steady state, and a repeat examination may be performed at any time
after 3 days.
2. Closer monitoring (e.g., 1 to 3 days) may be
necessary when damage is severe and the
IOP is high.
3. Once the IOP has been reduced adequately,
patients are reevaluated in 3- to 6-month
intervals for IOP and optic nerve checks.
4. Gonioscopy is performed yearly and after
starting a new-strength cholinergic agent
(e.g., pilocarpine).
5. Formal visual fields and optic nerve imaging (e.g., photographs, OCT, or HRT) are
rechecked as needed, often about every 6
to 12 months. If IOP control is not thought
to be adequate, visual fields may need to
be repeated more often. Once stabilized,
formal visual field testing can be repeated
annually.
6. Dilated retinal examinations should be performed yearly.

Argon Laser Trabeculoplasty
In some patients, as previously defined, ALT
may be used as first-line therapy. It has an initial success rate of 70% to 80%, dropping to
50% in 2 to 5 years.
Selective Laser Trabeculoplasty
The IOP-lowering effect of SLT is equivalent
to ALT. SLT utilizes lower energy and causes

LWBK1000-C09_p204-241.indd 210

7. If glaucomatous damage progresses, check
patient compliance with medications
before initiating additional therapy.
8. Patients must be questioned about side
effects associated with their specific
agent(s). They often do not associate eye
drops with impotence, weight loss, lightheadedness, or other significant symptoms.

Low-Pressure Primary Open-Angle Glaucoma (Normal Pressure Glaucoma)

211

LOW-PRESSURE PRIMARY OPEN-ANGLE
GLAUCOMA (NORMAL
PRESSURE GLAUCOMA)

Definition

Etiology

POAG occurring in patients without IOP elevation.

Controversial. Most investigators believe that
IOP plays an important role in low-pressure
POAG. Other proposed etiologies include
vascular dysregulation (e.g., systemic or nocturnal hypotension, vasospasm, or loss of
autoregulation), microischemic disease, accelerated apoptosis, and autoimmune disease.

Symptoms
See 9.1, Primary Open-Angle Glaucoma.

Signs
Critical. See Signs in 9.1, Primary Open-Angle
Glaucoma, except IOP is consistently below
22 mm Hg. There appears to be a greater likelihood of optic disc hemorrhages. Some believe
visual field defects are denser, more localized,
and closer to fixation. A dense nasal paracentral
defect is typical. Average CCT is generally 510 to
520 microns.

Differential Diagnosis
NOTE: Determining that optic nerve changes are
related to IOP and not another form of optic neuropathy is critical.
 POAG: IOP may be underestimated second-

ary to large diurnal fluctuations or thin
corneas. See 9.1, Primary Open-Angle Glaucoma.
 Shock optic neuropathy from previous epi-

sode of systemic hypotension (e.g., acute

artery bypass surgery, arrhythmia). Visual

crisis).

Work-Up
See Work-Up in 9.1, Primary Open-Angle Glaucoma. Also consider:
1. History: Evidence of vasospasm (history of
migraine or Raynaud phenomenon)? History of hypotensive crisis, anemia, or heart
disease? Previous use of corticosteroids by
any route? Trauma or uveitis in past? Has
the vision loss been acute or chronic? GCA
symptoms? Additional cardiovascular risk
factors such as elevated cholesterol, hypertension, and systemic hypotension (including nocturnal “dippers” in the early morning hours)?

2. Check color plates.
3. Check gonioscopy to rule out angle closure,
angle recession, or PAS.
4. Consider obtaining a diurnal curve of IOP
measurements to help confirm the diagnosis.
5. Consider carotid dopplers to evaluate ocular blood flow. Check blood pressure (consider 24-hour automated blood pressure
home monitor).
6. Consider CT or MRI to rule out compressive
lesions of the optic nerve or chiasm.

Treatment
1. Research suggests that further lowering of
IOP plays an important role in preventing
progression of low-pressure POAG. Target
IOPs are at least 30% lower than the level
at which progressive damage was occurring.

Glaucoma

Therapies are those for POAG. See 9.1,
Primary Open-Angle Glaucoma, for a more
in-depth discussion of these therapies.
2. Ischemia to the optic nerve head may play
a role in the pathogenesis of low-pressure
POAG. Modification of cardiovascular risk
factors is appropriate in managing general
health, but has not proven beneficial in
managing glaucoma. Refer to an internist
for control of blood pressure, cholesterol,
and optimal management of other comorbid conditions to maximize optic nerve
perfusion. Avoid use of antihypertensive
drugs at bedtime and use preferentially in
the morning.

Critical. IOP >2 (or 3) standard deviations
(approximately 3 mm Hg) above the average

2. If any abnormalities are present on formal

in 2 to 4 weeks to exclude the possibility
of learning curve artifacts. If the defects
are judged to be real, the diagnosis is glaucoma or ocular hypertension along with
another pathology accounting for the field

3. Vasospasm may play a role in the pathogenesis of low-pressure POAG. Some investigators advocate the use of systemic calcium
channel blockers in the treatment of this
condition. The benefit of these medications
has not been well established. Although it
may improve capillary perfusion to the
optic nerve head, systemic hypotension
associated with this therapy may conversely have the opposite effect on ocular
blood flow.

3. OCT and HRT may reveal glaucomatous
optic nerve defects. These objective tests
may show pathology earlier than visual
field testing.

Treatment
1. If there are no suggestive optic nerve or
visual field changes and IOP is <24 mm Hg,
no treatment other than close observation
is necessary.
2. Patients with an IOP >24 to 30 mm Hg
(threshold varies per glaucoma specialist),
but otherwise normal examinations are candidates for IOP-lowering therapy. A decision
to treat a patient should be based on the
patient’s choice to elect therapy and baseline risk factors such as age, CCT, initial IOP,
horizontal and vertical C/D ratio, and family
history. The results of the ocular hypertension treatment study (OHTS) showed that
treatment reduced the development of visual
field loss from 9.5% to 4.4% at 5 years, with
a 20% average reduction of IOP. However,
treatment also caused an increase in cataract
and adverse psychological episodes. If treatment is elected, a therapeutic trial in one eye,
as described for treatment of POAG, should
be used. Some clinicians may elect to monitor these patients with close observation.
Risk calculators have been developed to

22/12/11 12:30 AM

approximate the level of risk progression to
glaucoma if left untreated. These may help
guide clinicians and patients as to whether
treatment should be initiated. See 9.1, Primary Open-Angle Glaucoma.

Follow-Up
Close follow-up is required for patients being
treated and observed. All patients should initially
be followed similarly to POAG; see 9.1, Primary
Open-Angle Glaucoma. If there is no progression

in the first few years, monitoring frequency can
be decreased to every 6 to 12 months. Stopping
medication should be considered.

ACUTE ANGLE-CLOSURE GLAUCOMA

Symptoms
Pain, blurred vision, colored halos around
lights, frontal headache, nausea, and vomiting.

Signs
(See Figure 9.4.1.)
Critical. Closed angle in the involved eye,
acutely increased IOP, microcystic corneal
edema. Narrow or occludable angle in the fellow eye if of primary etiology.
Other. Conjunctival injection; fixed, middilated pupil.

Etiology of Primary Angle Closure
—Pupillary block: Apposition of the lens
and the posterior iris at the pupil leads to

blockage of aqueous humor flow from the
posterior chamber to the anterior chamber.
This mechanism leads to increased posterior
chamber pressure, forward movement of the
peripheral iris, and subsequent obstruction
of the trabecular meshwork (TM). Predisposed eyes have a narrow anterior chamber angle recess, anterior iris insertion of
the iris root, or shorter axial length. Risk
factors include increased age, East Asian
descent, female gender, hyperopia, and family history. May be precipitated by topical
mydriatics or, rarely, miotics, systemic anticholinergics (e.g., antihistamines and antidepressants), accommodation (e.g., reading), or dim illumination. Fellow eye has
similar anatomy.

—Angle crowding as a result of an abnormal iris configuration including high
peripheral iris roll or plateau iris syndrome

within first 2 weeks of starting medication. Usually bilateral angle-closure due
to supraciliary effusion and ciliary body
swelling with subsequent anterior rotation of the lens–iris diaphragm. Myopia

 Pigmentary glaucoma: Characteristic angle

changes, (4+ posterior trabecular meshwork
band); pigment cells floating in the anterior chamber; pigment line on the posterior
lens capsule or anterior hyaloid face; radial
iris transillumination defects (TIDs). See
9.10, Pigment Dispersion Syndrome/ Pigmentary Glaucoma.

Work-Up
1. History: Risk factors including hyperopia or
family history? Precipitating events such as
being in dim illumination, receiving dilating drops? Retinal problem? Recent laser
treatment or surgery? Medications (e.g.,
topical adrenergics or anticholinergics, oral
topiramate, or sulfa medications)?
2. Slit-lamp examination: Look for keratic
precipitates, posterior synechiae, iris atrophy or neovascularization, a mid-dilated
and sluggish pupil, a swollen lens, anterior chamber cells and flare or iridescent
particles, and a shallow anterior chamber.
Glaukomflecken (small anterior subcapsular lens opacities) and atrophy of the iris
stroma indicate prior attacks. Always carefully examine the other eye and compare.
3. Measure IOP.
4. Gonioscopy of both anterior chamber
angles. Corneal edema can be cleared by

22/12/11 12:30 AM

9.4

using topical hyperosmolar agents (e.g.,
glycerin). Gonioscopy of the involved eye
after IOP is reduced is essential in determining whether the angle has opened and
whether neovascularization is present.
5. Careful examination of the fundus looking
for signs of central retinal vein occlusion,
hemorrhage, optic nerve cupping, or spontaneous arterial pulsations. If cupping is pronounced or if there are spontaneous arterial
pulsations, treatment is more urgent.
6. When secondary angle-closure glaucoma is
suspected, B-scan US or US biomicroscopy
(UBM) may be helpful.

Treatment
Depends on etiology of angle closure, severity,
and duration of attack. Severe, permanent damage may occur within several hours. If visual
acuity is hand motions or worse, IOP reduction is usually urgent, and medications should
include all topical glaucoma medications not
contraindicated, intravenous acetazolamide,
and in some cases intravenous osmotic (e.g.,
mannitol). See 9.14, Neovascular Glaucoma,
9.16, Postoperative Glaucoma, 9.17, Aqueous Misdirection Syndrome/Malignant Glaucoma.
1. Compression gonioscopy is essential to
determine if the trabecular blockage is
reversible and may break an acute attack.
2. Topical therapy with b-blockers [(e.g., timolol 0.5%) caution with asthma or COPD],
a-2 agonist (e.g., brimonidine 0.15%), prostaglandin analogs (e.g., latanoprost 0.005%),
and CAIs (dorzolamide 2%) should be initiated immediately. In urgent cases, three
rounds of these medications may be given,
with each round being separated by 15 minutes.
3. Topical steroid (e.g., prednisolone acetate
1%) may be useful.
4. Systemic carbonic anhydrase inhibitors
[e.g., acetazolamide, 250 to 500 mg intravenously (i.v.), or two 250-mg tablets p.o.
in one dose if unable to give i.v.] if IOP
decrease is urgent or if IOP is refractory to
topical therapy. Do not use in topiramateor sulfonamide-induced angle closure.

5. Recheck the IOP and visual acuity in 1
hour. If IOP does not decrease and vision
does not improve, repeat topical medications and give mannitol 1 to 2 g/kg i.v.
over 45 minutes (a 500-mL bag of mannitol 20% contains 100 g of mannitol).
6. When acute angle-closure glaucoma is the
result of:
a. Phakic pupillary block or angle crowding: Pilocarpine, 1% to 2%, every 15
minutes for two doses, and pilocarpine,
0.5% to 1.0%, in the contralateral eye
for one dose.
b. Aphakic or pseudophakic pupillary block
or secondary closure of the angle: Do not
use pilocarpine. Consider a mydriatic
and a cycloplegic agent (e.g., cyclopentolate, 1% to 2%, and phenylephrine 2.5%
every 15 minutes for four doses) when
laser or surgery cannot be performed
because of corneal edema, inflammation,
or both.
c. Topiramate- or sulfonamide-induced secondary angle closure: Do not use CAIs.
Immediately discontinue the inciting
medication. Consider cycloplegia to
induce posterior rotation of the ciliary
body (e.g., atropine 1% b.i.d. or t.i.d.).
Consider hospitalization and treatment
with intravenous hyperosmotic agents
and intravenous steroids (methylprednisolone 250 mg i.v. every 6 hours) for
cases of markedly elevated IOP unresponsive to other treatments. Peripheral
iridectomy and miotics are not indicated.

9

7. In phacomorphic glaucoma, the lens
should be removed as soon as the eye is
quiet and the IOP controlled, if possible.
See 9.12.4, Phacomorphic Glaucoma.
8. Address systemic problems such as pain
and vomiting.
9. For pupillary block (all forms) or angle
crowding: If the IOP decreases significantly
(less than the fellow eye) and the angle is
open by gonioscopy, definitive treatment
with laser (YAG) peripheral iridotomy or
surgical iridectomy is performed once the

cornea is clear and the anterior chamber
is quiet, typically 1 to 5 days after attack.
Patients are discharged on the following
medications and followed daily:
• Prednisolone acetate 1% may be helpful.
• Acetazolamide 500 mg sequel p.o.

• Topical b-blocker b.i.d. and/or a-agonist
b.i.d.
• If phakic, pilocarpine 1% to 2% q.i.d.

inal laser surgery, a tight scleral buckle, or
nanophthalmos. Goniosynechialysis can
be performed for chronic angle closure
of <6 months’ duration. Systemic steroids
may be required to treat serous choroidal
detachments secondary to inflammation.

Follow-Up
After definitive treatment, patients are reevaluated in weeks to months initially, and then less
frequently. Visual fields and stereo disc photographs are obtained for baseline purposes.
NOTE:

NOTE: Some believe that once the attack is
broken, only pilocarpine and prednisolone acetate are necessary if the angle is open.

If IOP does not decrease after two courses
of maximal medical therapy, a laser (YAG)
PI should be considered if there is an adequate view of the iris. If IOP still does not
decrease after a second attempt at a laser
PI, then a laser iridoplasty or surgical PI
is needed and, in some cases, a guarded
filtration procedure.

9

NOTE: If affected eye is too inflamed initially
for laser PI, perform laser PI of the fellow eye
first. An untreated fellow eye has a 40% to 80%
chance of acute angle closure in 5 to 10 years.
Repeated angle-closure attacks with a patent PI
may indicate plateau iris syndrome. See 9.13,
Plateau Iris.

10. For secondary angle closure: Treat the
underlying problem. Consider argon laser
gonioplasty to open the angle, particularly
in cases that are the result of extensive ret-

1. Cardiovascular status and electrolyte balance
must be considered when contemplating osmotic
agents, CAIs, and b-blockers.
2. The corneal appearance may worsen when the
IOP decreases.
3. Worsening vision or spontaneous arterial pulsations are signs of increasing urgency for pressure
reduction.
4. Since one-third to one-half of first-degree
relatives may have occludable angles, patients
should be counseled to alert relatives to the
importance of screening.
5. Angle-closure glaucoma may be seen without
an increased IOP. The diagnosis should be suspected in a patient who had pain and reduced
acuity and is noted to have:
—An edematous, thickened cornea in one eye.
—Normal or markedly asymmetric pressure in
both eyes.
—Shallow anterior chambers in both eyes.
—Occludable anterior chamber angle in the fellow eye.

1. Laser trabeculoplasty contraindicated in
CACG prior to PI and can induce greater
scarring of the angle.
2. If patient has angle closure with pupillary
block, perform laser peripheral iridotomy to
prevent further angle-closure episodes. The
TM may have sustained enough damage that
the IOP will still be elevated despite a patent
iridotomy, necessitating continued use of
medications to lower the IOP.

3. Laser iridoplasty may be performed to
attempt to decrease the formation of new
PAS. This may not be effective, or may serve
as a temporary measure; if successful it may
be repeated. If iridoplasty fails and other
medical therapy has been maximized, the
patient may need additional surgery.

present (e.g., cataract, iris sphincter tears).

Differential Diagnosis
See 9.1, Primary Open-Angle Glaucoma.

Work-Up
1. History: Trauma? Family history of glaucoma?
2. Complete baseline glaucoma evaluation.
See 9.1, Primary Open-Angle Glaucoma.

Treatment
Angle-recession glaucoma with
increased width of the ciliary body band.
FIGURE 9.6.1.

Critical. Glaucoma (see 9.1, Primary OpenAngle Glaucoma) in an eye with characteristic
gonioscopic findings: an uneven iris insertion,
an area of torn or absent iris processes, and a
posteriorly recessed iris, revealing a widened
ciliary band (may extend for 360 degrees).
Comparison with the contralateral eye is of
great help in identification of recessed areas.

Other. The scleral spur may appear abnormally
white on gonioscopy because of the recessed

9.7

See 9.1, Primary Open-Angle Glaucoma. However, miotics (e.g., pilocarpine) may be ineffective or even cause increased IOP as a result
of a reduction of uveoscleral outflow. ALT and
SLT are rarely effective in this condition. Surgical therapy may be necessary if uncontrolled
with medications.

Follow-Up
Both eyes are monitored closely because of high
incidence of delayed open-angle glaucoma.
Patients with angle recession without glaucoma
are examined yearly. Those with glaucoma are
examined according to the guidelines detailed
in 9.1, Primary Open-Angle Glaucoma.

INFLAMMATORY OPEN-ANGLE GLAUCOMA

Symptoms
Pain, photophobia, decreased vision; symptoms may be minimal.

NOTE: Acute IOP increase is distinguished from
chronic IOP increase by the presence of corneal
edema, pain, and visual symptoms.

Signs
Critical. Elevated IOP with a significant
amount of anterior chamber inflammation;
open angle on gonioscopy. Characteristic glaucomatous optic nerve changes occur late in the
disease course.
Other. Miotic pupil, PAS, keratic precipitates,
conjunctival injection, ciliary flush, posterior
synechiae, and increased TM pigmentation,
especially inferiorly.

LWBK1000-C09_p204-241.indd 218

Differential Diagnosis
 Glaucomatocyclitic crisis (Posner–Schloss-

man syndrome): Open angle and absence
of synechiae on gonioscopy. Minimal to
no conjunctival injection. Unilateral with
recurrent attacks. See 9.8, Glaucomatocyclitic Crisis/Posner–Schlossman Syndrome.
 Steroid-response glaucoma: Open angle.

Patient on steroid medications (including

for uveitis). Can be difficult to differentiate
from inflammatory open-angle glaucoma.
If significant inflammation is present, it
should be assumed to be inflammatory
first. See 9.9, Steroid-Response Glaucoma.
 Pigmentary glaucoma: 3+ to 4+ trabecular

pigmentation. Acute increase in IOP, often
after exercise or pupillary dilatation; pigment cells in the anterior chamber. Open
angle. Radial iris TIDs are common. See
9.10, Pigment Dispersion Syndrome/Pigmentary Glaucoma.
 Neovascular

glaucoma. Nonradial, misdirected blood vessels along the pupillary
margin, the TM, or both. See 9.14, Neovascular Glaucoma.

 Fuchs heterochromic iridocyclitis: Asym-

metry of the iris color typically with mild
iritis in the eye with the lighter-colored iris.
Gonioscopy may reveal fine vessels that
cross the TM, without PAS. Usually unilateral. See 12.1, Anterior Uveitis (Iritis/Iridocyclitis).
 Pseudoexfoliation

syndrome: Occasionally exfoliative material on cornea can
be mistaken for keratic precipitates. See
9.11, Pseudoexfoliation Syndrome/Exfoliative
Glaucoma.

Etiology
 Uveitis: Anterior, intermediate, posterior,

or panuveitis.
 Keratouveitis.
 After trauma or intraocular surgery.

Work-Up
1. History: Previous attacks? Systemic disease
[e.g., juvenile idiopathic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, sarcoidosis, acquired
immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), V1
distribution varicella zoster, toxoplasmosis]? Previous corneal disease, especially
herpetic keratitis?

Treatment
1. Topical steroid (e.g., prednisolone acetate
1%) q1–6h, depending on the severity of
the anterior chamber inflammation.
NOTE: Topical steroids are not used, or are used
with extreme caution, in patients with an infectious process, particularly a fungal or herpes simplex infection.

2. Mydriatic/cycloplegic (e.g., scopolamine
0.25% t.i.d.).
3. One or more of the following pressurereducing agents can be used in addition
to the other treatments, depending on the
IOP and the status of the optic nerve:
a. Topical b-blocker (e.g., timolol 0.5%
b.i.d.) if not contraindicated (e.g.,
asthma, COPD).
b. Topical a-2 agonist (e.g., brimonidine
0.1% to 0.2% b.i.d. to t.i.d.).
c. Topical CAI (e.g., dorzolamide 2% t.i.d.)
or oral (e.g., methazolamide 25 to 50 mg
p.o. b.i.d. to t.i.d., or acetazolamide 500
mg sequel p.o. b.i.d.).
d. Anterior chamber paracentesis if IOP is
believed to be causing damage (see Appendix 13, Anterior Chamber Paracentesis).
e. Hyperosmotic agent when IOP is acutely
increased (e.g., mannitol 20% 1 to 2 g/kg
i.v. over 45 minutes).
4. Manage the underlying problem.
5. If IOP remains dangerously increased
despite maximal medical therapy, glaucoma filtering surgery with adjunct antifibrosis therapy may be indicated. Trabeculectomy surgery has high rates of failure in
cases of inflammatory glaucoma.
NOTE: Prostaglandin agonists (e.g., latanoprost
0.005%) and miotics (e.g., pilocarpine) should
be used with caution in inflammatory glaucoma.

2. Slit-lamp examination: Assess the degree
of conjunctival injection and aqueous cell
and flare. Posterior synechiae present?

Follow-Up

3. Complete baseline glaucoma evaluation.
See 9.1, Primary Open-Angle Glaucoma.

GLAUCOMATOCYCLITIC CRISIS/POSNER–
SCHLOSSMAN SYNDROME

Symptoms
Mild pain, decreased vision, rainbows around
lights. Often, a history of previous episodes. Usually unilateral in young to middle-aged patients.

Signs

unresponsive cases (see 9.9, Steroid-Response
Glaucoma). IOP elevation in the presence of
significant uveitis suggests the need for more,
not less, steroids and additional or alternative
pressure lowering therapy.

Other. Corneal epithelial edema, ciliary
flush, pupillary constriction, iris hypochromia, few fine keratic precipitates on the corneal endothelium or TM.

Differential Diagnosis
 Inflammatory open-angle glaucoma: Sig-

nificant amount of aqueous cells and flare.
Synechiae may be present. See 9.7, Inflammatory Open-Angle Glaucoma.
 Acute

angle-closure glaucoma: Shallow
anterior chamber and closed angle in the
involved eye. Narrow or closed angle in the
contralateral eye. See 9.4, Acute Angle-Closure Glaucoma.

 Pigmentary glaucoma: Acute increase in

IOP, often after exercise or pupillary dilatation, with pigment cells in the anterior
chamber. See 9.10, Pigment Dispersion Syndrome/Pigmentary Glaucoma.
 Neovascular glaucoma: Abnormal blood

vessels along the pupillary margin, the TM,
or both. See 9.14, Neovascular Glaucoma.

with the lighter-colored iris. The increase
in IOP is rarely as acute. See 12.1, Anterior
Uveitis (Iritis/Iridocyclitis).
 Others: Herpes simplex, varicella zoster

keratouveitis, toxoplasmosis, and others.

Etiology
Mechanism unknown, but possible association with herpes viruses.

Work-Up
1. History: Recent dilating drops, systemic
anticholinergic agents, or exercise? Previous attacks? Corneal or systemic disease?
Light sensitivity? Pain?
2. Slit-lamp examination: Assess the degree
of conjunctival injection and aqueous cell
and flare. Careful retinal examination for
vasculitis and snowbanking. Measure IOP.
3. Gonioscopy: Angle open? Synechiae, neovascular membrane, or keratic precipitates
present?
4. Complete baseline glaucoma evaluation.
See 9.1, Primary Open-Angle Glaucoma.

Treatment
1. Topical b-blocker (e.g., timolol 0.5% b.i.d.),
topical a-2 agonist (e.g., brimonidine 0.1%
to 0.2% b.i.d. or t.i.d.), topical CAI (e.g.,
dorzolamide 2% b.i.d. to t.i.d.).
2. Short course (1 week) of topical steroids (e.g.,
prednisolone acetate 1% q.i.d.) may decrease
inflammation. Longer use may cause an
elevation in IOP. Oral indomethacin (e.g.,
75 to 150 mg p.o. q.d.) or topical nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (e.g.,
ketorolac q.i.d.) may also be effective.

3. Consider a systemic CAI (e.g., acetazolamide 500 mg sequel p.o. b.i.d.) if IOP is
significantly increased.
4. Anterior chamber paracentesis when the
IOP is determined to be dangerously high
for the involved optic nerve (see Appendix
13, Anterior Chamber Paracentesis). Hyperosmotic agents (e.g., mannitol 20% 1 to
2 g/kg i.v. over 45 minutes) are second line.
5. Consider a cycloplegic agent (e.g., cyclopentolate 1% t.i.d.) if the patient is symptomatic.

Follow-Up
1. Patients are seen every few days at first and
then weekly until the episode resolves.

9.9

Critical. Increased IOP with the use of corticosteroids. Usually takes 2 to 4 weeks after
starting topical steroids, though rarely there
can be an acute rise of IOP within hours in
association with systemic use of steroid or
adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH).
Other. Signs of POAG may develop. See 9.1,
Primary Open-Angle Glaucoma.
NOTE: Patients with POAG or a predisposition to
development of glaucoma (e.g., family history, ocular trauma, diabetes, African descent, high myopia)
are more likely to experience a steroid response and
subsequent glaucoma.

Attacks usually subside within a few hours
to a few weeks.
2. Medical or surgical therapy may be required,
depending on the baseline IOP between
attacks.
3. If the IOP decreases to levels not associated
with disc damage, no treatment is necessary.
4. Steroids are tapered rapidly if they are used
for 1 week or less and slowly if they are used
for longer.

inflammation, it may be difficult to
determine the cause of the increased
IOP. See 9.7, Inflammatory Open-Angle
Glaucoma.

9

Etiology
Most commonly seen with topical, periocular,
or intravitreal steroid therapy, though elevated IOP can occur with all forms of administration, including oral, intravenous, inhalational, nasal, injected, or topical skin steroids.
More potent topical steroids (e.g., dexamethasone) more often cause significant rises in IOP
compared to those that are less potent (e.g.,
fluorometholone, loteprednol). The IOP typically decreases to pretreatment levels after steroids are stopped. The rate of decrease relates
to the duration of use and the severity of the
pressure increase. The IOP increase is due to
reduced outflow facility of the pigmented
TM, and when this is severe, the IOP may
remain increased for months after steroids are
stopped. IOP increase may also be caused by
increased inflammation in association with
systemic steroid usage.

Glaucoma

Work-Up
1. History: Duration of steroid use? Previous
steroid use or an eye problem from steroid
use? Glaucoma or family history of glaucoma? Herpetic keratouveitis? Diabetes?
Myopia? Ocular trauma?
2. Complete ocular examination: Evaluate the
degree of ocular inflammation and determine
the presence of iris or angle neovascularization (by gonioscopy), pigment suggestive of
pigment dispersion syndrome or pseudoexfoliation, blood in Schlemm canal, PAS, etc.
Measure IOP and inspect the optic nerve.
3. Complete baseline glaucoma evaluation,
See 9.1, Primary Open-Angle Glaucoma.

Treatment
Any or all of the following may be necessary
to reduce IOP:
1. Determine if steroid use (in any form) is truly
needed. If not needed, stop or taper steroids.
2. Reduce the concentration or dosage of the
steroid.

9

3. Change to a steroid with lesser propensity
for IOP elevation (e.g., fluorometholone,
loteprednol, or rimexolone).
4. Switch to a topical NSAID (e.g., ketorolac
0.4% or 0.5%, diclofenac 0.1%).

9.10

6. Consider anterior chamber paracentesis
if IOP is actively causing damage (see
Appendix 13, Anterior Chamber Paracentesis).
NOTE: For inflammatory glaucoma, if the inflammation is moderate to severe, increase the steroids initially to reduce the inflammation while
initiating antiglaucoma therapy.
If a medically uncontrollable dangerously high
IOP develops after a depot steroid injection, the
steroid may need to be excised. After intravitreal
triamcinolone, options include glaucoma filtering surgery or a pars plana vitrectomy to remove
the steroid.
In general, laser trabeculoplasty is not effective for these patients.
Steroid-induced glaucoma after LASIK may
be difficult to detect using applanation tonometry due to falsely low readings caused by interface fluid between the flap and the stromal bed.

Follow-Up
Dependent on the severity of pressure elevation and glaucomatous damage. Follow
patients as if they have POAG. (See 9.1, Primary Open-Angle Glaucoma).

PIGMENT DISPERSION SYNDROME/
PIGMENTARY GLAUCOMA

Definition
Pigment dispersion refers to a pathologic
increase in the TM pigment, associated with
characteristic mid-peripheral, radial iris TIDs.
Abnormal pigment dispersion is identified
as 3+ to 4+ TM pigmentation with increasing
radial TIDs or increasing corneal endothelial
pigmentation. The pigment may ultimately
obstruct the TM, leading to increased IOP
and secondary open-angle glaucoma. Pigment on the posterior lens capsule is nearly

therapy options.

pathognomonic and should always be looked
for during examination.

Symptoms
Blurred vision, eye pain, and colored halos
around lights after exercise or pupillary dilatation. May be asymptomatic. More common in
young adult, myopic men (age 20 to 45 years).
Usually bilateral, but asymmetric.

Pigment Dispersion Syndrome/Pigmentary Glaucoma

223

Typically, large fluctuations in IOP can occur,
during which pigment cells may be seen floating in the anterior chamber.

Differential Diagnosis
 Exfoliative glaucoma: Iris TIDs may be pres-

ent, but are near the pupillary margin and
are not radial. White, flaky material may
be seen on the pupillary border, anterior
lens capsule, and corneal endothelium. See
9.11, Pseudoexfoliation Syndrome/Exfoliative
Glaucoma.
FIGURE 9.10.1.

PDS with spokelike iris transillumina-

tion defects.

Critical. Mid-peripheral, spokelike iris TIDs
corresponding to iridozonular contact; dense
homogeneous pigmentation of the TM for 360
degrees (seen on gonioscopy) in the absence
of signs of trauma or inflammation.
Other. A vertical pigment band on the corneal endothelium typically just inferior to
the visual axis (Krukenberg spindle); pigment
deposition on the posterior equatorial lens
surface (e.g., Zentmayer line or Scheie line),
on the anterior hyaloid face, on Schwalbe
line, and sometimes along the iris (which can
produce iris heterochromia). The angle often
shows a wide ciliary body band with 3+ to
4+ pigmentation of the posterior TM at the
12-o’clock position. Pigmentary glaucoma is
characterized by the pigment dispersion syndrome plus glaucomatous optic neuropathy.

 Inflammatory open-angle glaucoma: White

blood cells and flare in the anterior chamber; no radial iris TIDs; often PAS on gonioscopy. See 9.7, Inflammatory Open-Angle
Glaucoma.
 Iris melanoma: Pigmentation of the angu-

lar structures accompanied by either a
raised, pigmented lesion on the iris or a diffusely darkened iris. No iris TIDs. See 5.13,
Malignant Melanoma of the Iris.

mentation of the ciliary processes with
increased TM pigment deposition.

 Siderosis.
 Iris chafe with sulcus IOL.

Work-Up

2. Slit-lamp examination, particularly checking for iris TIDs. Large defects may be seen
by shining a small slit beam directly into
the pupil to obtain a red reflex, but scleral
transillumination is required if the defects
are not extremely marked. Look for a
Krukenberg spindle on the corneal endothelium. Look for pigment on lens equator
by angling the slit beam nasally and having the patient look temporally (pathognomonic for pigment dispersion). Careful
retinal examination because of increased
incidence of lattice degeneration and retinal detachment.

Glaucoma

3. Perform baseline glaucoma evaluation. See
9.1, Primary Open-Angle Glaucoma.

Treatment
Similar to POAG. Depends on the IOP, optic
nerve damage, and extent of the symptoms.
Usually patients with pigment dispersion
without ocular hypertension, glaucoma, or
symptoms are observed carefully. A stepwise
approach to control IOP is usually taken when
mild-to-moderate glaucomatous changes are
present. When advanced glaucoma is discovered on initial examination, maximal medical
therapy may be instituted initially. See 9.1,
Primary Open-Angle Glaucoma.
1. Decrease mechanical iridozonular contact.
Two methods have been proposed:

9

—Miotic agents: A theoretical first-line
therapy because they minimize iridozonular contact. However, because most
patients are young and myopic, the resulting fluctuation in myopia may not be tolerated. In addition, approximately 14% of
patients have lattice retinal degeneration
and are thus predisposed to retinal detachment from the use of miotics. In some
cases, pilocarpine 4% gel q.h.s. may be
tolerated.

9.11

2. Other antiglaucoma medications. See 9.1,
Primary Open-Angle Glaucoma.
3. Patients typically respond well to SLT or ALT.
Younger patients respond better than older
patients, in contrast to POAG. However,
there is a greater risk of post-laser IOP spikes.
Lower energy should be used, and initially
only 180 degrees of treatment is advised.
4. Consider guarded filtration procedure
when medical and laser therapy fail. These
young myopic patients are at a greater risk
for the development of hypotony maculopathy, and antimetabolites should be used
cautiously.

Follow-Up
Every 1 to 6 months, with a formal visual
field test every 6 to 12 months, depending
on the severity of the symptoms and the
glaucoma.

PSEUDOEXFOLIATION SYNDROME/
EXFOLIATIVE GLAUCOMA

Definition
A systemic disease in which grayish-white
material is deposited on the lens, iris, ciliary
epithelium, and TM. Presence of exfoliative
material increases the risk of glaucoma sixfold. Currently, the most common secondary
glaucoma in those of European descent.

Symptoms
Usually asymptomatic in its early stages.

Signs
(See Figures 9.11.1 and 9.11.2.)

LWBK1000-C09_p204-241.indd 224

—Peripheral laser iridotomy: Laser peripheral iridotomy has been recommended to
reduce pigment dispersion by decreasing
iridozonular contact, but it is still controversial. It may be best suited in early-stage
disease and ill advised in more advanced
stages.

Critical. White, flaky material on the pupillary margin; anterior lens capsular changes
(central zone of exfoliation material, often
with rolled-up edges, middle clear zone, and
a peripheral cloudy zone); peripupillary iris
TIDs; and glaucomatous optic neuropathy.
Bilateral, but often asymmetric.
Other. Irregular black pigment deposition on
the TM more marked inferiorly than superiorly;
black scalloped deposition of pigment anterior
to Schwalbe line (Sampaolesi line) seen on gonioscopy, especially inferiorly. White, flaky material may be seen on the corneal endothelium,

cases, believed to be secondary to iris dilator
muscle atrophy). Incidence increases with age.
These patients are more prone to having narrow angles, especially inferiorly.

Differential Diagnosis
 Inflammatory glaucoma: Corneal endotheli-

al deposits can be present in both exfoliative
and uveitic glaucoma. Typically, IOP is highly unstable in both. The ragged volcano-like
PAS of some inflammatory glaucomas are not
seen in the exfoliation syndrome, but angle
closure due to narrow angle is not rare in
the exfoliation syndrome. Photophobia is

or anterior lens capsule. Glaucoma can
occur.

Work-Up
1. History: Occupational exposure to heat?
2. Slit-lamp examination with IOP measurement; look for white flaky material along
the pupillary margin, often need to dilate
the pupil to see the anterior lens capsular
changes. Gonioscopy may reveal scattered
“pepper” changes in the inferior angle,
which are often the first change and are
highly characteristic.

3. Perform baseline glaucoma evaluation. See
9.1, Primary Open-Angle Glaucoma.

Treatment
1. For medical therapy, see 9.1, Primary OpenAngle Glaucoma.
2. Consider SLT/ALT, which has a higher success rate in exfoliative glaucoma than in
POAG, but shorter duration of effectiveness.
3. Consider guarded filtration procedure
when medical or laser therapy fails.

months).
NOTE: Cataract extraction does not eradicate the
glaucoma. Cataract extraction may be complicated by weakened zonular fibers and synechiae
between the iris and peripheral anterior lens capsule with increased risk of intraoperative vitreous
loss and zonular dehiscence. Postoperative intraocular lens dislocation may occur with time.

Every 1 to 3 months as with POAG, but with
the awareness that damage can progress very
rapidly.
NOTE: Many patients have pseudoexfoliation syndrome without glaucoma. These patients are reexamined every 6 to 12 months because of glaucoma
risk, but they are not treated unless the IOP rises to
levels considered dangerous.

after cataract surgery for IOP monitoring.
2. If the IOP returns to normal, the patient
should be rechecked within 1 week.

9.12.2. LENS-PARTICLE GLAUCOMA

The immediate goal of therapy is to reduce the
IOP and to reduce the inflammation. The cataract should be removed promptly (within several days).

Definition

1. Topical b-blocker (e.g., timolol 0.5% b.i.d.),
a-2 agonist (e.g., brimonidine 0.1% to 0.2%
b.i.d. to t.i.d.), and/or topical CAI (e.g., dorzolamide 2% t.i.d.).

Symptoms

2. Systemic CAI (e.g., acetazolamide 500 mg
sequel p.o. b.i.d.). Benefit of maintaining
topical CAI in addition to a systemic agent
is controversial.

227

Lens material liberated by trauma or surgery
that obstructs aqueous outflow channels.

Pain, blurred vision, red eye, tearing, photophobia. History of recent ocular trauma or
intraocular surgery.

Signs

3. Topical cycloplegic (e.g., scopolamine 0.25%
t.i.d.).

Critical. White, fluffy pieces of lens cortical
material in the anterior chamber, combined
with increased IOP. A break in the lens capsule
may be observed.

4. Topical steroid (e.g., prednisolone acetate
1% every 15 minutes for four doses then
q1h).

Other. Anterior chamber cell and flare, conjunctival injection, or corneal edema. The
anterior chamber angle is open on gonioscopy.

5. Hyperosmotic agent if necessary and no
contraindications are present (e.g., mannitol, 1 to 2 g/kg i.v. over 45 minutes).

Differential Diagnosis

6. The IOP usually does not respond adequately to medical therapy. Although it
is preferable to reduce IOP before cataract
extraction, adequate IOP control may not
be possible with medication alone. Cataract removal is usually performed within
24 to 48 hours. In patients who have
noticed a sudden decrease in vision, the
urgency of cataract surgery is increased,
especially in those whose vision has progressed to NLP over a few hours. In such
cases, lowering the IOP immediately with
an anterior chamber paracentesis is necessary prior to cataract extraction (see
Appendix 13, Anterior Chamber Paracentesis). Glaucoma surgery is usually not
necessary at the same time as cataract
surgery.

 See 9.12.1, Phacolytic Glaucoma. In phaco-

lytic glaucoma, the cataractous lens has not
been extracted or traumatized.
 Infectious endophthalmitis: Usually a nor-

mal or low IOP. Unless lens cortical material
can be unequivocally identified in the anterior chamber, and there is nothing atypical
about the presentation, endophthalmitis
must be excluded. See 12.13, Postoperative
Endophthalmitis, and 12.15, Traumatic Endophthalmitis.
 Phacoanaphylaxis: Follows trauma or intra-

ocular surgery, producing anterior chamber
inflammation and sometimes a high IOP.
The inflammation is often granulomatous,
and fluffy lens material is not present in the
anterior chamber. See 9.12.3, Phacoanaphylaxis.

Glaucoma

Work-Up
1. History: Recent trauma or intraocular surgery?
2. Slit-lamp examination: Search the anterior
chamber for lens cortical material and measure the IOP.
3. Gonioscopy of the anterior chamber
angle.
4. Optic nerve evaluation: The degree of optic
nerve cupping helps determine how long
the increased IOP can be tolerated.

Treatment
See 9.12.1, Phacolytic Glaucoma, for medical
treatment. If medical therapy fails to control the
IOP, the residual lens material must be removed
surgically.

9.12.4. PHACOMORPHIC GLAUCOMA
Phacomorphic glaucoma is caused by closure
of the anterior chamber angle by a large intumescent cataract. A pupillary block mechanism
may play a role. The initial treatment includes
topical antiglaucoma medication, although
oral CAIs and hyperosmotics may be necessary
as well (see 9.4, Acute Angle-Closure Glaucoma).
A laser iridectomy may be effective in breaking
the angle-closure attack, although this is usually
unsuccessful. Cataract extraction is the definitive treatment. In cases where the lens is very
dense it may be appropriate to remove the lens
via a pars plana lensectomy since an extracapsular extraction may be difficult. Some have
suggested treating as if for aqueous misdirection (see 9.17, Aqueous Misdirection Syndrome/
Malignant Glaucoma).

Follow-Up
Depending on the IOP and the health of the
optic nerve, patients are reexamined in 1 to
7 days.

9.12.3. PHACOANAPHYLAXIS

9

Phacoanaphylaxis is a chronic granulomatous
uveitis in response to lens material liberated
by trauma or intraocular surgery. Phacoanaphylaxis can have an associated glaucoma,
although this is very rare. After lens material
is liberated, there is a latent period where an
immune sensitivity develops. Inflammatory
cells surround lens material, and glaucoma
may result from blockage of the TM by these
cells and lens particles. Other forms of uveitis
should be considered, including sympathetic
ophthalmia. Other forms of lens-induced
glaucoma must be considered including lens
particle and phacolytic glaucomas. Treatment
is with topical steroids and antiglaucoma
medications. The lens should be removed
surgically, particularly if IOP or inflammation
cannot be adequately controlled with medicine.

LWBK1000-C09_p204-241.indd 228

9.12.5. GLAUCOMA CAUSED BY LENS
DISLOCATION OR SUBLUXATION
Mechanisms for glaucoma in subluxed/
dislocated lenses include an inflammatory
reaction caused by the lens material itself,
pupillary block, or damage to the anterior
chamber angle sustained during the trauma.
A dislocated lens may become hypermature
and cause a phacolytic glaucoma (see 9.12.1,
Phacolytic Glaucoma). In addition, a dislocated
or subluxed lens can lead to phacoanaphylaxis (see 9.12.3, Phacoanaphylaxis). Pupillary
block is the most common mechanism and
can occur secondary to anterior displacement
of the lens or to vitreous plugging the pupil.
Treatment is aimed at relieving the pupillary
block. Iridectomy is usually indicated and
necessary to prevent future attacks. Cycloplegics are helpful. IOP-lowering medications
are employed. Miotics are not indicated with
cycloplegics and antiglaucoma medicines. Surgical lens removal may be necessary in certain
cases. See 13.10, Subluxed or Dislocated Crystalline Lens, for a more in-depth discussion.

Plateau Iris

229

PLATEAU IRIS

Symptoms
Usually asymptomatic, unless acute angle-closure glaucoma develops. See 9.4, Acute AngleClosure Glaucoma.

Signs
Critical. Flat iris plane and normal anterior chamber depth centrally, sharply convex
peripheral iris with an anterior iris apposition seen on gonioscopy. Hyperopia is not
as common in plateau iris as it is in angle
closure secondary to pupillary block. With
acute angle closure associated with a plateau
iris, the axial anterior chamber depth may be
normal, but the peripheral iris bunches up to
occlude the angle (see 9.4, Acute Angle-Closure
Glaucoma).

Differential Diagnosis
 Acute angle-closure glaucoma associated

with pupillary block: The central anterior
chamber depth is decreased, and the entire
iris has a convex appearance. See 9.4, Acute
Angle-Closure Glaucoma.
 Aqueous misdirection syndrome: Marked

diffuse shallowing of the anterior chamber,
often after cataract extraction or glaucoma
surgery. See 9.17, Aqueous Misdirection Syndrome/Malignant Glaucoma.
 For other disorders, see 9.4, Acute Angle-

phacomorphic glaucoma. UBM findings
are characteristic (peripheral iris cysts). See
Figure 9.13.1.

Work-Up
1. Slit-lamp examination: Specifically check
for the presence of a patent PI and the critical signs listed previously.
2. Measure IOP.
3. Gonioscopy of both anterior chamber angles.
4. Undilated optic nerve evaluation.
5. Can be assessed by UBM.
NOTE: If dilation must be performed in a patient
suspected of having a plateau iris, warn the patient
that this may provoke an acute angle-closure
attack. The preferred agent is 0.5% tropicamide.
Use phenylephrine 2.5% to dilate if dapiprazole
0.5% is available for reversal. If an anticholinergic
is needed, use only tropicamide 0.5%. Recheck
the IOP every few hours until the pupil returns to
normal size. Have the patient notify you immediately if symptoms of acute angle closure develop.
Dilate only one eye at a time.

9

Treatment
If Acute Angle Closure is Present:
1. Treat medically. See 9.4, Acute Angle-Closure
Glaucoma.

Closure Glaucoma.

Types
1. Plateau iris configuration: Because of the
anatomic configuration of the angle, acute
angle-closure glaucoma develops from only
a mild degree of pupillary block. These
angle-closure attacks may be treated with a
laser PI.
2. Plateau iris syndrome: The peripheral iris
can bunch up in the anterior chamber
angle and obstruct aqueous outflow without any element of pupillary block. The
plateau iris syndrome is present when the
angle closes and the IOP rises after dilation,
despite a patent PI, and in the absence of

Glaucoma

2. A laser PI is performed within 1 to 3 days
if the angle-closure attack can be broken
medically. If the attack cannot be controlled, a laser or surgical PI may need to be
done as an emergency procedure.
3. One week after the laser PI, gonioscopy
should be repeated prior to dilating the eye
with a weak mydriatic (e.g., tropicamide
0.5%). If the IOP increases or a spontaneous angle-closure episode occurs, plateau iris
syndrome is diagnosed and should be treated
with an iridoplasty, or as a second choice, a
weak miotic (e.g., pilocarpine 0.5% to 1%
t.i.d. to q.i.d.) may be used chronically.
4. Consider a laser iridoplasty to break an
acute attack not responsive to medical
treatment and PI.

—If the angle continues to develop new
PAS or becomes narrower despite iridoplasty, then treat as CACG (see 9.5, Chronic
Angle-Closure Glaucoma). Consider lens
extraction or chronic pilocarpine therapy.

Follow-Up
1. Similar to performing a PI in acute angle
closure, reevaluate in 1 week, 1 month, and
3 months, and then yearly if no problems
have developed.
2. Patients with a plateau iris configuration
without previous acute angle closure are
examined every 6 months.

1. Laser PI to relieve the pupillary block component.

3. Every examination should include IOP
measurement and gonioscopy looking for
PAS formation, narrowing angle recess, or
increasing angle closure. The PI should
be examined for patency. Dilation should
cautiously be performed periodically
(approximately every 2 years) to ensure
that the PI remains adequate to prevent
angle closure.

2. Check gonioscopy every 4 to 6 months to
evaluate the angle.

4. Ophthalmoscopic disc evaluation is essential.

5. If the patient’s IOP does respond to a laser
PI (e.g., plateau iris configuration), then a
prophylactic laser PI may be indicated in
the contralateral eye within 1 to 2 weeks.
If Acute Angle Closure is not Present:

—Perform iridoplasty if new PAS or further
narrowing of the angle develops.

NEOVASCULAR GLAUCOMA

Definition

Symptoms

Glaucoma that is caused by a fibrovascular
membrane overgrowing the anterior chamber angle structures. Initially, the angle may
appear open but blocked by the membrane.
The fibrovascular membrane eventually contracts, causing PAS formation and secondary
angle-closure glaucoma. Rarely, may have neovascularization of the angle without neovascularization of the iris (NVI) at the pupillary
margin. Ischemia-driven vascular endothelial
growth factor (VEGF) release from a variety of
causes results in the formation of the fibrovascular membrane.

May be asymptomatic or include pain, redeye, photophobia, and decreased vision.

Signs
(See Figures 9.14.1 and 9.14.2.)
Critical.
 Stage 1: Nonradial, misdirected blood ves-

sels along the pupillary margin, the TM, or

longstanding increased IOP (e.g., neglected
angle-closure glaucoma). See specific sections.

Work-Up
1. History: Determine the underlying etiology.

2. Complete ocular examination, including IOP measurement and gonioscopy to
evaluate the degree of angle closure, if any.
A dilated retinal evaluation is essential in
determining the etiology and for evaluating
the disc.
3. Fluorescein angiography as needed to identify an underlying retinal abnormality or in
preparation for panretinal photocoagulation (PRP).
4. Carotid Doppler studies to rule out stenosis
when no retinal etiology is identified.
5. B-scan US is indicated when the retina cannot be visualized to rule out an intraocular
tumor or retinal detachment.

Treatment
FIGURE 9.14.2.

q1–6h) and a cycloplegic (e.g., atropine 1%
t.i.d.). Atropine may reduce IOP when the
angle is closed by increasing uveoscleral
outflow.
2. Reduce the IOP if it is increased. The target
IOP is around 30 mm Hg in most patients.
Where visual potential is good and cupping
marked, a lower target IOP may be appropriate. Any or all of the following medications are used:
—Topical b-blocker (e.g., timolol 0.5%
b.i.d.).
—Topical a-2 agonists (e.g., brimonidine
0.1% to 0.2% b.i.d. to t.i.d.).
—Systemic or topical CAI (e.g., acetazolamide 500 mg sequel p.o. b.i.d. or dorzolamide 2% b.i.d. to t.i.d.).
—Prostaglandins may help lower IOP, but
may increase inflammation and are usually
avoided in the acute phase.

NOTE: Miotics (e.g., pilocarpine) are contraindicated because of their effects on the blood–
aqueous barrier. Epinephrine compounds (e.g.,
dipivefrin) are usually ineffective.

severe complications, including sympathetic ophthalmia and phthisis bulbi.
5. Intravitreal anti-VEGF agents (e.g., ranibizumab or bevacizumab) may be used to
promote regression of iris neovascularization prior to, or in conjunction with, filtering surgery or PRP. Their effect is temporary,
and their use for treatment of neovascularization is currently off-label. They are particularly useful in stage 1 and 2 neovascular
glaucoma, where the angle is still open,
to prevent angle closure during the interval required for PRP to take effect. Caution
should be used when no view of the retina
is possible. (See 11.12, Diabetic Retinopathy,
and 11.17, Neovascular or Exudative (Wet)
Age-Related Macular Degeneration, for a discussion on anti-VEGF agents.)
6. Goniophotocoagulation (laser photocoagulation of new vessels in the angle) in
the very early stages may be used in addition to the previously described treatments
in patients with significant angle NV but
minimal angle closure. This procedure may
reduce the risk of angle closure during the
interval required for the PRP to take effect
(often several weeks), but this has not been
established and is rarely used.

3. If retinal ischemia is thought to be responsible for the NV, then treat with PRP. If
the retina cannot be visualized, lower the
IOP and treat the retina once the cornea
clears. Treatment with cryotherapy can
also be considered if the cornea does not
clear and the retina cannot be visualized
adequately. These procedures are used if
the angle is open or if filtration surgery
(regardless of angle status) is going to be
performed.

7. In eyes without useful vision, topical steroids
and cycloplegics may be adequate therapy
for pain control. The pain in chronic neovascular glaucoma is not primarily a function of the IOP, and reducing IOP may not
be needed if the goal is pain control only.
In the acute stages, after a rapid rise in IOP,
a paracentesis may be helpful. Beta-blockers, retrobulbar chlorpromazine or alcohol
injection, or enucleation may be required
to reduce pain. See 13.12, Blind, Painful Eye.

4. Glaucoma filtration surgery may be performed when the NV is inactive and the
IOP cannot be controlled with medical
therapy. Tube-shunt procedures may be
helpful to control IOP in some patients
with active NV, but may be complicated by
postoperative bleeding. They should not be
performed unless there is useful vision to
preserve. External or endocyclophotocoagulation is an option but should be done
only with full awareness of potentially

8. Treat the underlying disorder.

LWBK1000-C09_p204-241.indd 232

Follow-Up
The presence of NVI, especially with high IOP,
requires urgent therapeutic intervention, usually within 1 to 2 days. Angle closure can proceed rapidly (days to weeks).
NOTE: NVI without glaucoma is managed similarly,
but there is no need for pressure-reducing agents
unless IOP increases.

Iridocorneal Endothelial Syndrome

233

IRIDOCORNEAL ENDOTHELIAL SYNDROME

Definition
Three overlapping syndromes—essential iris
atrophy, Chandler, and iris nevus (Cogan–
Reese)—that share an abnormal corneal
endothelial cell layer, which can grow across
the anterior chamber angle. Secondary angle
closure can result from contraction of this
membrane.

Symptoms
Asymptomatic early. Later, the patient may
note an irregular pupil or iris appearance,
blurred vision, monocular diplopia, or pain
if IOP increases or corneal edema develops.
Usually unilateral and most common in
patients 20 to 50 years of age. More common
in women. Familial cases are rare.

Signs
(See Figure 9.15.1.)
Critical. Corneal endothelial changes (fine,
beaten-bronze appearance); microcystic corneal edema; localized, irregular, high PAS that
often extend anterior to Schwalbe line; deep
central anterior chamber; iris alterations as follows:
—Essential iris atrophy: Marked iris thinning leading to iris holes with displacement and distortion of the pupil (corectopia). Usually good prognosis.

—Chandler syndrome: Mild iris thinning
and corectopia. The corneal and angle
changes are most marked in this variant.
However, findings are extremely variable
with some cases having minimal changes
and others marked. Patients often have corneal edema even at normal IOP. Accounts
for about 50% of ICE syndrome cases. Variable prognosis.
—Iris nevus/Cogan–Reese syndrome: Pigmented nodules (not true nevi) on the
iris surface, variable iris atrophy. Similar
changes may be seen in Chandler syndrome and essential iris atrophy, resulting
from contraction of the membrane over
the iris, constricting around small islands
of iris tissue. Usually poor prognosis.
Other. Corneal edema, elevated IOP, optic
nerve cupping, or visual field loss. Unilateral
but with occasional mild corneal changes
in the fellow eye. However, the glaucoma is
nearly always unilateral.

Differential Diagnosis

Glaucoma

Work-Up
1. Family history: ICE syndrome is not inherited, Axenfeld–Rieger spectrum and PPCD
are often autosomal dominant.
2. Perform baseline glaucoma evaluation. See
9.1, Primary Open-Angle Glaucoma. Careful
attention should be given to cornea and iris
evaluation.
3. Consider slit-lamp photos and corneal endothelial specular microscopy.

Treatment
No treatment is needed unless glaucoma or
corneal edema is present, at which point one or
more of the following treatments may be used:
1. IOP-reducing medications. See 9.1, Primary
Open-Angle Glaucoma. The IOP may need to
be reduced dramatically to eliminate corneal
edema. This critical level may become lower
as the patient ages.

9

9.16

3. Consider filtering procedure (trabeculectomy) when medical therapy fails because
of persistent corneal edema or progression
of glaucoma. Laser trabeculoplasty and
laser PI are ineffective. If trabeculectomy
fails, the procedure can often be salvaged
with ab interno YAG sclerostomy in area of
previous sclerostomy. If tube-shunt procedure is performed, place tube far into the
anterior chamber to lessen the likelihood of
occlusion with the endothelial membrane.
4. Consider a corneal transplant in cases of
advanced chronic corneal edema in the
presence of good IOP control.

Follow-Up
Varies according to the IOP and optic nerve
damage. If asymptomatic with healthy optic
nerve, may see every 6 to 12 months. If glaucoma is present, then every 1 to 3 months,
depending on the severity.

POSTOPERATIVE GLAUCOMA

9.16.1. EARLY POSTOPERATIVE GLAUCOMA
IOP tends to start to increase approximately
1 hour after cataract extraction and usually
returns to normal within 1 week. Etiologies
include retained viscoelastic material or lens
particles, pupillary block, hyphema, pigment
dispersion, and generalized inflammation.
Most normal eyes can tolerate an IOP up to 30
mm Hg for many months. However, eyes with
preexisting optic nerve damage require IOPlowering medications for any significant pressure increase. Prostaglandin agonists are generally avoided postoperatively because of their
proinflammatory characteristics. Most eyes
with an IOP >30 mm Hg should be treated. If
inflammation is excessive, increase the topical
steroid dose to every 30 to 60 minutes while
awake and consider a topical NSAID (e.g.,
ketorolac or diclofenac q.i.d.). See 9.7, Inflammatory Open-Angle Glaucoma.

LWBK1000-C09_p204-241.indd 234

2. Hypertonic saline solutions (e.g., sodium
chloride 5% drops q.i.d. and ointment
q.h.s.) may reduce corneal edema.

Differential Diagnosis
Early Postoperative Period (within 2 weeks)
 Inflammation secondary to prostaglandin
release, blood, fibrin, etc.
 Hyphema.
 Failure to filter after filtration surgery due

to tight scleral flap, blocked sclerostomy

nant glaucoma): When cycloplegics are
stopped. See 9.17, Aqueous Misdirection Syndrome/Malignant Glaucoma.
 Steroid-induced glaucoma. See 9.9, Steroid-

Response Glaucoma.

Signs
Increased IOP, shallow or partially flat anterior
chamber with anterior iris bowing (iris bombé),
absence of a patent PI. Evidence of iris adhesions to lens, anterior capsule, or intraocular
lens.

Treatment
1. If the cornea is clear and the eye is not significantly inflamed, a PI is performed, usually
by YAG laser. Because the PI tends to close,
it is often necessary to perform two or more
iridotomies. They need to be larger than in
the eye with primary angle-closure glaucoma. See Appendix 15, YAG Laser Peripheral
Iridotomy.
2. If the cornea is hazy, the eye is inflamed,
or a PI cannot be performed immediately,
then:
—Mydriatic agent (e.g., cyclopentolate 2%
and phenylephrine 2.5%, every 15 minutes
for four doses).
—Topical therapy with b-blockers [(e.g., timolol 0.5%) caution with asthma or COPD], a-2
agonist (e.g., brimonidine 0.15%), and CAIs
(dorzolamide 2%) should be initiated immediately. In urgent cases, three rounds of these
medications may be given, with each round
being separated by 15 minutes.
—Systemic CAI (e.g., acetazolamide, 250 to
500 mg i.v., or two 250-mg tablets p.o.
in one dose if unable to give i.v.) if IOP

decrease is urgent or if IOP is refractory to
topical therapy.
—Topical steroid (e.g., prednisolone acetate 1%) every 15 to 30 minutes for four
doses.
—PI, preferably YAG laser, when the eye
is less inflamed. If the cornea is not clear,
topical glycerin may help clear it temporarily.
—A surgical PI may be needed.
—A guarded filtration procedure or tube
shunt may be needed, if the angle has
become closed.

2. Topical steroid (e.g., prednisolone acetate
1% four to eight times per day) and consider topical NSAID (e.g., ketorolac or

3. Systemic CAI (e.g., acetazolamide 500 mg
sequel p.o. b.i.d.) or may consider topical
CAI (e.g., dorzolamide 2% t.i.d.).

and a-2 agonist (e.g., brimonidine 0.1% to
0.2% b.i.d. to t.i.d.).
5. Consider laser ablation if a bleeding site
can be identified.
6. Consider surgical repositioning, replacement, or removal of the intraocular lens,
especially if patient experiences recurrent
episodes, PAS are forming, or CME persists.

the TM. These cells are khaki colored. Often
occurs after a large vitreous hemorrhage with
a posterior capsular opening, but may also be
seen in the absence of prior intraocular surgery. Usually occurs 1 to 3 months after the
vitreous hemorrhage.

Treatment

May be very mild early. Moderate pain, red
eye, photophobia may develop. Classically
follows surgery in eyes with small anterior
segments (e.g., hyperopia, nanophthalmos) or
surgery for primary angle-closure glaucoma;
also may develop after trabeculectomy, tubeshunt operations, cataract surgery, various
laser procedures, and many retinal surgeries.
May occur spontaneously or be induced by
miotics (even without surgery).

Signs

Detect a Wound Leak.
 Suprachoroidal hemorrhage: Shallow or flat

anterior chamber. IOP typically high. See
11.27, Choroidal Effusion/Detachment.

Etiology
Believed to result from anterior rotation of the
ciliary body with posterior misdirection of the
aqueous; aqueous accumulates in the vitreous
resulting in forward displacement of the ciliary processes, the crystalline lens, the intraocular implant, or the anterior vitreous face,
causing secondary angle closure.

adhesions of iris to other anterior chamber
structures. See 9.16.2, Postoperative Pupillary

Postoperative Complications of Glaucoma Surgery

Treatment
1. If an iridectomy is not present or an existing PI is not clearly patent, pupillary block
cannot be ruled out, and a PI should be
performed. See 9.4, Acute Angle-Closure
Glaucoma. If signs of malignant glaucoma
are still present with a patent PI, attempt
medical therapy to control IOP and return
aqueous flow to the normal pathway.

face in an attempt to restore the normal anatomic flow of aqueous:
—YAG laser disruption of the anterior hyaloid face and posterior capsule if aphakic
or pseudophakic. If phakic, may attempt
through a preexisting large PI.

2. Atropine 1% and phenylephrine 2.5% q.i.d.
topically.

—Vitrectomy and reformation of the anterior chamber with rupture of the anterior
hyaloid face. Passing an activated vitrector from the posterior segment through a
peripheral iridectomy is often helpful.

3. CAI (e.g., acetazolamide 500 mg i.v. or two
250-mg tablets p.o.).

—Lensectomy with disruption of the anterior hyaloid or vitrectomy.

4. Topical b-blocker (e.g., timolol 0.5% b.i.d.).

—Argon laser of the ciliary processes.

5. Topical a-2 agonist (e.g., apraclonidine
1.0% or brimonidine 0.1% to 0.2% b.i.d).
6. If needed, hyperosmotic agent (e.g., mannitol 20% 1 to 2 g/kg i.v. over 45 minutes).
If the attack is broken (the anterior chamber deepens and the IOP normalizes), continue atropine 1% q.d., indefinitely. At a later
date, perform PI in the contralateral eye if the
angle is occludable.
If steps 1 through 6 are unsuccessful, consider one or more of the following surgical
interventions to disrupt the anterior hyaloid

9.18

NOTE: An undetected anterior choroidal detachment may be present. Therefore, a sclerotomy to
drain a choroidal detachment may be considered
before vitrectomy.

Follow-Up
Variable, depending on the therapeutic
modality used. PI is usually performed in an
occludable contralateral eye within a week
after treatment of the involved eye.

2. If the trabeculectomy flap is too tight,
suture lysis may be indicated.
3. If the sclerostomy is blocked with iris, any
pressure on the globe is contraindicated.
Topical pilocarpine or slow intracameral
injection of acetylcholine can pull the
iris out of the sclerostomy if iris incarceration developed within the past 2 to 3
days. If this fails, and the sclerostomy is
completely blocked by iris, transcorneal
mechanical retraction of the iris may work.
In rare cases, argon laser iridoplasty may be
useful to pull the iris enough to restore filtration. If the sclerostomy is blocked with
vitreous, photodisruption of the sclerostomy with a YAG laser may be attempted.
Blood or fibrin at the sclerostomy may clear
with time or tissue plasminogen activator
(10 µg) injected intracamerally may reestablish aqueous flow through the sclerostomy.
4. For suprachoroidal hemorrhage, if the IOP is
mildly increased and the chamber is formed,
observation with medical management is
indicated. Surgical drainage is indicated for
persistent chamber flattening or IOP elevation, corneal–lenticular touch, chronic retinal fold apposition, intolerable pain. If possible, delay drainage for at least 4 days.
5. Medical therapy may be necessary if these
measures are not successful. See 9.1, Primary Open-Angle Glaucoma.
6. If the above measures fail, reoperation may
be necessary.

LOW POSTOPERATIVE IOP AFTER FILTERING
PROCEDURE
Low pressures (5 to 9 mm Hg) are associated
with complications such as flat anterior chamber, choroidal detachment, and suprachoroidal hemorrhage. An IOP <4 mm Hg is more
likely associated with complications including
macular hypotony and corneal edema.

Differential Diagnosis and Treatment
1. Large bleb with a deep chamber (overfiltration): It is often beneficial to have a large
bleb in the first few weeks after trabeculec-

LWBK1000-C09_p204-241.indd 239

239

tomy. However, treatment is appropriate if
it is still present 6 to 8 weeks after surgery,
the patient is symptomatic, IOP is decreasing, or the anterior chamber is shallowing.
Treatment includes topical atropine 1%
b.i.d., intracameral viscoelastic, and possibly autologous blood injection into the
bleb. If IOP is stable and anterior chamber
is deep, observe.
2. Large bleb with a flat chamber (Grade I or
II): Treatment includes cycloplegics (atropine 1% t.i.d.) and careful observation. If
the anterior chamber becomes more shallow (e.g., Grade I becoming Grade II), the
IOP decreases as the bleb flattens, or choroidal detachment develops, the anterior
chamber may be reformed with a viscoelastic material.
3. No bleb with flat chamber: Check carefully for a wound leak by Seidel testing (see
Appendix 5, Seidel Test to Detect a Wound
Leak). If positive, aqueous suppressants,
patching, or surgical closure may be necessary. If negative, look for a cyclodialysis cleft
(by gonioscopy) or serous choroidal detachments. Cyclodialysis clefts are managed by
cycloplegics, laser or cryotherapy (to close
the cleft), or surgical closure. Serous choroidal detachments are often observed, as they
resolve when the IOP normalizes, in most
cases. See 11.27, Choroidal Effusion/Detachment.

9

4. Grade III flat chamber: This is a surgical
emergency and demands prompt correction. Methods include drainage of a choroidal detachment and reformation of the
anterior chamber with or without revision
of the scleral flap or tube, reformation of
the anterior chamber with viscoelastic, and
cataract extraction with or without other
procedures.

Work-Up
1. Slit-lamp examination with careful evaluation of the bleb, anterior chamber, and

ANISOCORIA

Eyelid position and extraocular motility
MUST be evaluated when anisocoria is present
(see Figure 10.1.1).

Classification
1. The abnormal pupil is constricted.
—Unilateral exposure to a miotic agent
(e.g., pilocarpine).
—Iritis: Eye pain, redness, and anterior
chamber cells and flare.
—Horner syndrome: Mild ptosis on the
side of the small pupil. See 10.2, Horner Syndrome.
—Argyll Robertson (syphilitic) pupil:
Always bilateral, irregularly round miotic
pupils, but a mild degree of anisocoria is
often present. See 10.3, Argyll Robertson
Pupils.
—Long-standing Adie pupil: The pupil
is initially dilated, but over time may
constrict. Hypersensitive to pilocarpine
0.125%. See 10.4, Adie (Tonic) Pupil.
2. The abnormal pupil is dilated.
—Iris sphincter muscle damage from
trauma: Torn pupillary margin or iris transillumination defects seen on slit-lamp
examination.
—Adie (tonic) pupil: The pupil may be irregular, reacts minimally to light, and slowly
and tonically to convergence. Hypersensitive to pilocarpine 0.125%. See 10.4, Adie
(Tonic) Pupil.

—Third cranial nerve palsy: Always associated ptosis and/or extraocular muscle palsies. See 10.5, Isolated Third Nerve Palsy.
—Unilateral exposure to a mydriatic agent:
Cycloplegic drops (e.g., atropine), scopolamine patch for motion sickness, illfitting mask in patients on nebulizers (using
ipratropium bromide), possible use of sympathetic medications (e.g., pseudoephedrine). If the mydriatic exposure is recent,
pupil will not react to pilocarpine 1%.
3. Physiologic anisocoria: Pupil size disparity
is the same in light as in dark, and the pupils react normally to light. The size difference is usually, but not always, <2 mm in
diameter.

Work-Up
1. History: When was the anisocoria first
noted? Associated symptoms or signs? Ocular trauma? Eye drops or ointments? Syphilis? Old photographs?
2. Ocular examination: Try to determine
which pupil is abnormal by comparing
pupil sizes in light and in dark. Anisocoria greater in light suggests the abnormal
pupil is the larger pupil; anisocoria greater
in dark suggests the abnormal pupil is the
smaller pupil. Test the pupillary reaction to
both light and near. Evaluate for the presence of a relative afferent pupillary defect.
Look for ptosis, evaluate ocular motility,
and examine the pupillary margin with a
slit lamp.

—If the abnormal pupil is small, a diagnosis of Horner syndrome may be confirmed
by a cocaine or apraclonidine test (see 10.2,
Horner Syndrome). In the presence of ptosis
and an unequivocal increase in anisocoria
in dim illumination, cocaine and apraclonidine testing may be unnecessary.
—If the abnormal pupil is large and there
is no sphincter muscle damage or signs of
third nerve palsy (e.g., extraocular motility
deficit, ptosis), the pupils are tested with
one drop of pilocarpine 0.125%. Within
10 to 15 minutes, an Adie pupil will constrict significantly more than the fellow
pupil [see 10.4, Adie (Tonic) Pupil].

10.2

NOTE: For an acute Adie pupil, the pupil may
not react to a weak cholinergic agent.

—If the pupil does not constrict with pilocarpine 0.125%, or pharmacologic dilatation is suspected, pilocarpine 1% is instilled
in both eyes. A normal pupil constricts
sooner and to a greater extent than the
pharmacologically dilated pupil. An eye
that recently received a strong mydriatic
agent such as atropine usually will not constrict at all.
See 10.2, Horner Syndrome, 10.3, Argyll Robertson Pupils, 10.4, Adie (Tonic) Pupil, and 10.5,

(See Figure 10.2.1.)

Differential Diagnosis

Critical. Anisocoria that is greater in dim
illumination (especially during the first few
seconds after the room light is dimmed). The
abnormal small pupil dilates less than the
normal, larger pupil. Mild ptosis (2 mm) and
lower eyelid elevation (“reverse ptosis”) occur
on the side of the small pupil.

See 10.1, Anisocoria.

Other. Lower intraocular pressure, lighter
iris color in congenital cases (iris heterochromia), loss of sweating (anhydrosis, distribution depends on the site of lesion), transient
increase in accommodation (older patients

Etiology
 First-order neuron disorder: Stroke (e.g., ver-

severe osteoarthritis of the neck with bony

 Second-order neuron disorder: Tumor (e.g.,

lung carcinoma, metastasis, thyroid adenoma, neurofibroma). Patients with pain in
the arm or scapular region should be suspected of having a Pancoast tumor. In children, consider neuroblastoma, lymphoma,
or metastasis.

10.2

 Congenital Horner syndrome: May also be

caused by birth trauma.
 Other rare causes: Cervical paraganglioma,

ectopic cervical thymus.

Work-Up
1. Diagnosis confirmed with a positive
cocaine test. Place one drop of 10%
cocaine in both eyes. Check in 15 minutes. If no change in pupillary size is
noted, repeat drops and recheck the
pupils in 15 minutes (repeat until normal pupil dilates). A Horner pupil dilates
less than the normal pupil. Alternatively,
either 1% or 0.5% apraclonidine may be
used. Apraclonidine causes relative reversal of anisocoria. The miotic pupil with
Horner syndrome will appear larger than
the normal pupil.
NOTE: There may be a high false-negative rate
to pharmacologic testing in an acute Horner
syndrome.

2. A third-order neuron disorder may be distinguished from a first- and second-order
neuron disorder with hydroxyamphetamine. Place one drop of 1% hydroxyamphetamine in both eyes. Check in
15 minutes and repeat if no change in
pupillary size is noted. Failure of the
Horner pupil to dilate to an equivalent
degree as the fellow eye indicates a thirdorder neuron lesion, which may help guide
the work-up. However, most experts feel
the entire sympathetic pathway should be
imaged in Horner syndrome regardless of
the results of pharmacologic testing.
NOTE: The hydroxyamphetamine test has a
sensitivity of up to 93% and a specificity of
83% for identifying a third-order neuron lesion.
Hydroxyamphetamine should not be used
within 24 hours of cocaine or apraclonidine
to avoid possible interference with each other.
Both drops require an intact corneal epithelium
and preferably no prior eye drops (including
anesthetic drops) for accurate results.

3. Determine the duration of the Horner
syndrome from the patient’s history and

an examination of old photographs. Newonset Horner syndrome requires a more
urgent diagnostic work-up to exclude
life-threatening etiologies [(e.g., internal carotid artery dissection, which can
present with transient visual loss, head/
neck/face pain, or dysgeusia (foul taste in
the mouth)]. An old Horner syndrome is
more likely to be benign.
4. History: Headaches? Arm pain? Previous
stroke? Previous surgery that may have
damaged the sympathetic chain, including cardiac, thoracic, thyroid, or neck
surgery? History of head or neck trauma?
Ipsilateral neck pain?
5. Physical examination (especially check
for supraclavicular nodes, thyroid enlargement, or a neck mass).
6. Complete blood count (CBC) with differential.
7. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest
to evaluate lung apex for possible mass
(e.g., Pancoast tumor).
8. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the
brain and neck.
9. Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA)
or CT angiography (CTA) of head/neck
or carotid Doppler ultrasonography (US)
to evaluate for carotid artery dissection
(especially with neck pain). MRA and CTA
appear to be superior to Doppler US for
evaluation of carotid artery dissection and
allow for evaluation of the distal internal
carotid artery. Additionally, imaging of
the brain can be accomplished during the
same examination which streamlines the
work-up process. Obtain carotid angiography if MRA, CTA, or Doppler yield equivocal results.

2. Slit-lamp examination: Look for interstitial
keratitis (see 4.18, Interstitial Keratitis).
3. Dilated fundus examination: Search for
chorioretinitis, papillitis, and uveitis.
4. Fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption (FTA-ABS) or microhemagglutinationTreponema pallidum (MHA-TP), rapid plasma
reagin (RPR) or Venereal Disease Research
Laboratories (VDRL) test.
5. If the diagnosis of syphilis is established,
lumbar puncture (LP) may be indicated. See
12.12, Syphilis, for specific indications.

Treatment
1. Treatment based on the presence of active
disease and previous appropriate treatment.
2. See 12.12, Syphilis, for treatment indications and specific antibiotic therapy.

Follow-Up
This is not an emergency. Diagnostic workup and determination of syphilitic activity

Adie (Tonic) Pupil

247

ADIE (TONIC) PUPIL

Symptoms
Difference in size of pupils, blurred near
vision, photophobia. May be asymptomatic.

Lyme disease less commonly. Rare associations
reported with endometriosis, seminomas, and
Sjogren syndrome.

Signs

Work-Up

Critical. An irregularly dilated pupil that has
minimal or no reactivity to light. Slow, tonic
constriction with convergence, and slow redilation.

See 10.1, Anisocoria, for a general work-up
when the diagnosis is uncertain.

NOTE: It is typically unilateral initially and more
common in young women.

2. Test for cholinergic hypersensitivity. Instill
0.125% pilocarpine in both eyes and
recheck pupils in 10 to 15 minutes. An Adie
pupil constricts while the normal pupil
does not.

Other. May have an acute onset and become
bilateral. The involved pupil may become
smaller than the normal pupil over time.

Differential Diagnosis
See 10.1, Anisocoria.
 Parinaud syndrome/dorsal midbrain lesion:

Bilateral mid-dilated pupils that react poorly
to light but constrict normally with convergence (not tonic). Associated with eyelid retraction (Collier Sign), supranuclear
upgaze paralysis, and convergence retraction nystagmus. An MRI should be performed to rule out pinealoma and other
midbrain pathology.
 Holmes–Adie syndrome: Tonic pupil and

tendon areflexia. May be associated with
autonomic and peripheral neuropathy.

1. Evaluate pupils at slit lamp or with a muscle light for irregular and slow constriction.

3. If bilateral simultaneous Adie pupils, consider further laboratory investigations
including testing for the aforementioned
etiologies. For unilateral involvement,
no further laboratory investigations are
necessary.
NOTE: The dilute pilocarpine test may occasionally be positive in familial dysautonomia. Hypersensitivity may not be present with an acute Adie
pupil and may need to be retested a few weeks
later.

10

4. If Adie pupil is present in a patient younger
than 1 year, consult a pediatric neurologist
to rule out familial dysautonomia (Riley–
Day syndrome).

Etiology
Idiopathic most commonly. Orbital trauma,
surgery, and varicella zoster infection are seen
frequently. Early syphilis, parvovirus B19,
herpes simplex virus, botulism, paraneoplastic syndrome, giant cell arteritis (GCA), panretinal photocoagulation, and neurological

LWBK1000-C10_p242-292.indd 247

Treatment
Pilocarpine 0.125% b.i.d. to q.i.d. for cosmesis
and to aid in accommodation, if desired.

Follow-Up
If the diagnosis is certain, follow-up is routine.

 Parinaud syndrome/dorsal midbrain lesion:

Bilateral mid-dilated pupils that react poorly
to light but constrict normally with convergence (not tonic). Associated with eyelid retraction (Collier Sign), supranuclear
upgaze paralysis, and convergence retraction nystagmus. No ptosis.
 GCA: Extraocular muscle ischemia due to

involvement of the long posterior ciliary
arteries. Any extraocular muscle may be
affected, resulting in potentially complex
horizontal and vertical motility deficits.
Pupil typically not involved. Age ≥55 years.
See 10.17, Arteritic Ischemic Optic Neuropathy
(Giant Cell Arteritis).

Etiology
 Pupil involving:

—More common: Aneurysm, particularly
posterior communicating artery aneurysm.
—Less common: Tumor, trauma, congenital, uncal herniation, cavernous sinus mass
lesion, pituitary apoplexy, orbital disease,
varicella zoster virus, and leukemia. In children, ophthalmoplegic migraine.

LWBK1000-C10_p242-292.indd 249

 Relative pupil sparing: Ischemic microvas-

cular disease; less likely compressive.
 Aberrant

regeneration present: Trauma,
aneurysm, tumor, congenital. Not microvascular. See 10.6, Aberrant Regeneration of the
Third Nerve.

Work-Up
1. History: Onset and duration of diplopia?
Recent trauma? Pertinent medical history
[e.g., diabetes, hypertension, known cancer or central nervous system (CNS) mass,
recent infections]. If ≥55 years old, specifically ask about GCA symptoms.
2. Complete ocular examination: Check for
pupillary involvement, the directions of
motility restriction (in both eyes), ptosis,
a visual field defect (visual fields by confrontation), proptosis, resistance to retropulsion, orbicularis muscle weakness, and
eyelid fatigue with sustained upgaze. Look
carefully for signs of aberrant regeneration. See 10.6, Aberrant Regeneration of the
Third Nerve.
3. Full neurologic examination: Carefully
assess the other cranial nerves on both
sides.

10

NOTE: The ipsilateral fourth nerve can be
assessed by focusing on a superior conjunctival blood vessel and asking the patient to look
down and nasally. The eye should intort, and
the blood vessel should turn down and toward
the nose even if the eye cannot be adducted.

4. Immediate CNS imaging to rule out mass/
aneurysm is indicated for:
a. Pupil-involving (relatively or completely involved) third nerve palsies.
b. Pupil-sparing third nerve palsies in the
following groups of patients:
—Patients ≤50 years of age (unless
there is known long-standing diabetes
or hypertension).

Neuro-Ophthalmology

—Patients with incomplete third
nerve palsies (with sparing of some
muscle function) because this condition may be evolving into a pupil-involving third nerve palsy. If imaging
not obtained, closely monitor patients
for pupil involvement daily for at least
7 days.
—Patients with additional cranial nerve
or neurologic abnormalities.
c. Children <10 years of age, regardless of
the state of the pupil.
NOTE: Most sensitive modality is contrastenhanced CT and CTA, though gadoliniumenhanced MRI and MRA are also very
sensitive and can be done if CT and CTA
are contraindicated or unavailable. Choice
of imaging should be made in conjunction with neuroradiology. If initial imaging
studies are negative but clinical suspicion
remains high, catheter angiography may be
indicated.

5. Prompt CNS imaging is required for:
a. All patients in whom aberrant regeneration develops, with the exception
of regeneration after traumatic third
nerve palsies.

10

b. Pupil-sparing third nerve palsy for
>3 months in duration without improvement.
6. Imaging is usually not required in complete pupil-sparing third nerve palsies
that do not fit these criteria, especially in
patients >50 years of age with known vasculopathic risk factors such as diabetes or
hypertension.
7. Cerebral angiography is indicated for
all patients >10 years of age with pupilinvolving third nerve palsies and whose
imaging study is negative or shows a mass
consistent with an aneurysm.

LWBK1000-C10_p242-292.indd 250

8. CBC with differential in children.
9. Edrophonium chloride test or ice-pack
test when myasthenia gravis is suspected.
See 10.11, Myasthenia Gravis.
10. For suspected ischemic disease: Check
blood pressure, fasting blood sugar, glycosylated hemoglobin.
11. Immediate erythrocyte sedimentation
rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), and
platelets if GCA is suspected. See 10.17,
Arteritic Ischemic Optic Neuropathy (Giant
Cell Arteritis).

Treatment
1. Treat the underlying abnormality.
2. If the third nerve palsy is causing symptomatic diplopia, an occlusion patch or
prism may be placed over the involved eye.
Patching is usually not performed in children <11 years of age because of the risk of
amblyopia. Children should be monitored
closely for the development of amblyopia
in the deviated eye.
3. Strabismus surgery may be considered for
persistent significant misalignment.

Follow-Up
1. Pupil sparing: Observe daily for 7 days
from onset of symptoms for delayed pupil
involvement, and then recheck every 4 to
6 weeks. If secondary to ischemia, function
should return within 3 months. If the palsy
does not reverse or is not improving by 3
months, the pupil dilates, additional neurologic abnormalities develop, aberrant regeneration appears, or an incomplete third
nerve palsy progresses, then urgent imaging
is obtained. Refer to internist for management of vasculopathic disease risk factors.
2. Pupil involving: If imaging and angiography are negative, an LP should be considered and the patient should be followed as
described above.

compression by a posterior communicating
artery aneurysm.
 Primary aberrant regeneration: A term used

Signs
(See Figures 10.6.1 and 10.6.2.)
The most common signs of aberrant third
nerve regeneration include:
 Eyelid-gaze dyskinesis: Elevation of involved

eyelid on downgaze (Pseudo-von Graefe
sign) or adduction.
 Pupil-gaze dyskinesis: Pupil constricts on

downgaze or adduction.
 Other signs may include limitation of ele-

vation and depression of eye, adduction
of involved eye on attempted elevation or
depression, absent optokinetic response, or
pupillary light-near dissociation.

Etiology
Thought to result from misdirection of the
third nerve fibers from their original destination to alternate third nerve controlled muscles (e.g., inferior rectus to the pupil).
 Aberrancy from congenital third nerve

palsies: Can be seen in up to two-thirds of
these patients.
 Aberrancy from prior acquired third nerve

palsies: Seen most often in patients recovering from third nerve damage by trauma or

to describe the presence of aberrant regeneration in a patient who has no history of a third
nerve palsy. Usually indicates the presence
of a progressively enlarging parasellar lesion
such as a carotid aneurysm within the cavernous sinus or tumor such as meningioma.

Work-Up
1. Aberrancy from congenital: None. Document work-up of prior congenital third
nerve palsy.
2. Aberrancy from acquired: See 10.5, Isolated
Third Nerve Palsy. Document work-up of
prior acquired third nerve palsy if previously obtained.
3. Primary aberrancy: All patients must undergo neuroimaging to rule out slowly
compressive lesion or aneurysm.
NOTE: Ischemic third nerve palsies DO NOT produce aberrancy. If aberrant regeneration develops in a presumed ischemic palsy, neuroimaging
should be performed.

10

Treatment
1. Treat the underlying disorder.
2. Consider strabismus surgery if significant
symptoms are present.

ISOLATED FOURTH NERVE PALSY

Symptoms
Binocular vertical (or oblique) diplopia, difficulty reading, sensation that objects appear
tilted; may be asymptomatic.

Signs
(See Figures 10.7.1 and 10.7.2.)
Critical. Deficient inferior movement of an
eye when attempting to look down and in.
The three-step test isolates a palsy of the superior oblique muscle (see below).

10

Other. The involved eye is higher (hypertropic) in primary gaze. The hypertropia
increases when looking in the direction of
the uninvolved eye or tilting the head toward
the ipsilateral shoulder. The patient often
maintains a head tilt toward the contralateral
shoulder to eliminate diplopia.

Differential Diagnosis
All of the following may produce binocular
vertical diplopia, hypertropia, or both.
 Myasthenia gravis: Variable symptoms with

fatigability. Ptosis common. Orbicularis oculi

weakness often present. See 10.11, Myasthenia Gravis.
 Thyroid eye disease: May have propto-

sis, eyelid lag, lid retraction, or injection
over the involved rectus muscles. Positive
forced-duction test. See 7.2.1, Thyroid Eye
Disease. See Appendix 6, Forced-Duction Test
and Active Force Generation Test.
 Idiopathic orbital inflammatory syndrome:

Idiopathic Orbital Inflammatory Syndrome.
 Orbital fracture: History of trauma. Positive

forced-duction test. See 3.9, Orbital Blow-out
Fracture.
 Skew deviation: The three-step test does

not isolate a particular muscle. Rule out a
posterior fossa or brainstem lesion by MRI

Nerve Palsy.
 Brown syndrome: Limitation of elevation

in adduction due to restriction of superior oblique tendon. May be congenital or
acquired (e.g., trauma, inflammation). Positive forced-duction test. See 8.6, Strabismus
Syndromes.
 GCA: Extraocular muscle ischemia caus-

ing nonspecific motility deficits or neural
ischemia mimicking a cranial nerve palsy.
Age ≥55 years, usually associated systemic
symptoms. See 10.17, Arteritic Ischemic Optic
Neuropathy (Giant Cell Arteritis).

Etiology
More common: Trauma, vascular infarct
(often the result of underlying diabetes or
hypertension), congenital, idiopathic, or
demyelinating disease.
Rare: Tumor, hydrocephalus, aneurysm, GCA.

Work-Up
1. History: Onset and duration of the diplopia? Misaligned eyes or head tilt since early
childhood? Trauma? Stroke?
2. Examine old photographs to determine
whether the head tilt is long standing, indicating an old or congenital fourth nerve
palsy.
3. Perform the three-step test:
Step 1: Determine which eye is deviated
upward in primary gaze. This is best seen
with the cover–uncover test (see Appendix
3, Cover/Uncover and Alternate Cover Tests).
The higher eye comes down after being
uncovered.
Step 2: Determine whether the upward
deviation is greater when the patient looks
to the left or to the right.
Step 3: Determine whether the upward
deviation is greater when tilting the head
to the left shoulder or right shoulder.
Patients with a superior oblique muscle
paresis have a hyperdeviation that is worse
when turning the elevated eye nasally and
when tilting the head toward the shoulder
ipsilateral to the elevated eye.

Isolated Fourth Nerve Palsy

253

Patients with bilateral fourth nerve palsies demonstrate hypertropia of the right
eye when looking left, hypertropia of the left
eye when looking right, and a “V”-pattern
esotropia (the eyes cross more when looking
down).
In addition to the findings on the threestep test, the hypertropia should be greater
in downgaze than in upgaze.
4. Perform the double Maddox rod test if
bilateral fourth nerve palsies are suspected
to measure total excyclotorsion.
—A white Maddox rod is placed before one
eye and a red Maddox rod is placed before
the other eye in a trial frame or phoropter, aligning the axes of each rod along the
90-degrees vertical mark. While looking at
a white light in the distance, the patient is
asked if both the white and red lines seen
through the Maddox rods are horizontal and
parallel to each other. If not, the patient is
asked to rotate the Maddox rod(s) until they
are parallel. If he or she rotates the top of this
vertical axis outward (away from the nose)
for more than 10 degrees total for the two
eyes, then a bilateral superior oblique muscle
paresis is likely present.
5. Measure vertical fusional amplitudes with a
vertical prism bar to distinguish a congenital from an acquired palsy.
—A patient with an acquired fourth nerve
palsy has a normal vertical fusional amplitude of 1 to 3 prism diopters. A patient
with a congenital fourth nerve palsy has
>3 prism diopters (sometimes up to 10 to
15 prism diopters) of fusional amplitude.

10

6. Edrophonium chloride test, ice test, or rest
test if myasthenia gravis is suspected (see
10.11, Myasthenia Gravis).
7. CT scan of head and orbits (axial and coronal views) for suspected orbital disease.
8. Blood pressure measurement, fasting
blood sugar, and glycosylated hemoglobin.
Immediate ESR, CRP, and platelets if GCA is
suspected.
9. MRI of the brain for:

Treatment

Follow-Up

1. Treat the underlying disorder.

1. Congenital fourth nerve palsy: Routine.

2. An occlusion patch may be placed over one
eye or fogging plastic tape can be applied
to one lens of patient’s spectacles to relieve
symptomatic double vision. Patching is
usually not performed in children <11 years
of age because of the risk of amblyopia.

2. Acquired fourth nerve palsy: As per the underlying disorder. If the work-up is negative, the lesion is presumed vascular or
idiopathic and the patient is reexamined in
1 to 3 months. If the palsy does not resolve
in 3 months or if an additional neurologic
abnormality develops, appropriate imaging
studies of the brain are indicated. Patients
are instructed to return immediately for
any changes (e.g., ptosis, worsening diplopia, sensory abnormality, pupil abnormality).

3. Prisms in spectacles may be prescribed for
small, stable hyperdeviations.
4. Strabismus surgery may be indicated for
bothersome double vision in primary
or reading position or for a cosmetically

 Primary divergence insufficiency: Usually

acquired and benign; esotropia and diplopia only at distance and single binocular
vision at near. Symptoms may improve
spontaneously without treatment or may be
corrected with base-out prisms or surgery. If
the history reveals sudden onset, trauma,
infection (e.g., meningitis, encephalitis),
multiple sclerosis (MS), or malignancy,
divergence paralysis should be considered
and a neurologic work-up with MRI of the
brain and brainstem obtained.
 GCA: Extraocular muscle ischemia, age ≥55

years may be associated with systemic symptoms. See 10.17, Arteritic Ischemic Optic Neuropathy (Giant Cell Arteritis).

Etiology
Adults
More common: Vasculopathic (e.g., diabetes,
hypertension, other atherosclerotic risk factors), trauma, idiopathic.
Less common: Increased intracranial pressure, cavernous sinus mass (e.g., meningioma,
aneurysm, metastasis), MS, sarcoidosis, vasculitis, after myelography or LP, stroke (usually
with other neurologic deficits), meningeal
inflammation/infection (e.g., Lyme disease,
neurosyphilis), GCA.
Children
Benign and usually self-limited after viral infection or vaccination, trauma, increased intracranial pressure (e.g., obstructive hydrocephalus),
pontine glioma, Gradenigo syndrome (petrositis causing sixth and often seventh nerve

Work-Up
Adults
1. History: Do the symptoms fluctuate during
the day? Cancer, diabetes, or thyroid disease? Symptoms of GCA (in the appropriate
age group)?
2. Complete neurologic and ophthalmic
examinations; pay careful attention to the
function of the other cranial nerves and
the appearance of the optic disc. Because
of the risk of corneal damage, it is especially important to evaluate the fifth cranial nerve. Corneal sensation (supplied by
the first division) can be tested by touching a wisp of cotton or a tissue to the corneas before applying topical anesthetic.
Ophthalmoscopy looking for papilledema
is required because increased intracranial
pressure from any cause can result in unilateral or bilateral sixth nerve palsies.
3. Check blood pressure, fasting blood sugar,
and glycosylated hemoglobin.
4. MRI of the brain is indicated for the following patients:
—Younger than 45 years of age (if MRI is
negative, consider LP).
—Consider MRI for patients aged 45 to
55 years with no vasculopathic risk factors.

—Sixth nerve palsy accompanied by severe
pain or any other neurologic or neuroophthalmic signs.
—Any history of cancer.
—Bilateral sixth nerve palsies.
—Papilledema is present.
5. Immediate ESR, CRP, and platelet count if
GCA is suspected. See 10.17, Arteritic Ischemic Optic Neuropathy (Giant Cell Arteritis).

corner of the mouth, ectropion, and lagophthalmos. May have ipsilateral decreased taste
on anterior two-thirds of tongue, decreased
basic tear production, or hyperacusis. May
have an injected eye with a corneal epithelial
defect. Synkinesis, a simultaneous movement
of muscles supplied by different branches of
the facial nerve or simultaneous stimulation
of visceral efferent fibers of facial nerve [e.g.,
corner of mouth contracts when eye closes,
excessive lacrimation when eating (“crocodile” tears)], secondary to aberrant regeneration implying chronicity.

Etiology
Central Lesions
 Cortical: Lesion of contralateral motor cortex or internal capsule (e.g., stroke, tumor).
Loss of voluntary facial movement; emotional facial movement sometimes intact.
May also have ipsilateral hemiparesis.
 Extrapyramidal: Lesion of basal ganglia

canal, tongue, face, or neck. Progresses over
10 days. May have sensorineural hearing
loss, tinnitus, or vertigo.
 Guillain–Barré syndrome: Viral syndrome

followed by progressive motor weakness or
paralysis or cranial nerve palsies, or both.
Loss of deep tendon reflexes. May have
bilateral facial palsies.

(e.g., parkinsonism, tumor, vascular lesion
of basal ganglia). Loss of emotional facial
movement; volitional facial movement
intact. Not a true facial paralysis.

 Lyme disease: May have rash, fever, fatigue,

 Brainstem: Lesion of ipsilateral pons (e.g.,

 Sarcoidosis: May have uveitis, parotitis, skin

MS, stroke, tumor). Often with ipsilateral
sixth nerve palsy, contralateral hemiparesis. Occasionally with cerebellar signs.

lesions, or lymphadenopathy. May have
bilateral facial palsies. See 12.6, Sarcoidosis.

Peripheral Lesions
 Cerebellopontine angle (CPA) masses (e.g.,
acoustic neuroma, facial neuroma, meningioma, cholesteatoma, metastasis): Gradual
progressive onset, although sometimes
acute. May have facial pain, twitching, or
a characteristic nystagmus. This is smallamplitude rapid jerk nystagmus in which
the fast phase is directed away from the side
of the lesion (peripheral vestibular) in conjunction with a slow, gaze-evoked nystagmus directed toward the side of the lesion
(from brainstem compression). May have
eighth nerve dysfunction, including hearing
loss, tinnitus, vertigo, or dysequilibrium.
 Temporal bone fracture: History of head

trauma. May have Battle sign (ecchymoses
over mastoid region), cerebrospinal fluid
otorrhea, hearing loss, vertigo, or vestibular
nystagmus.
 Other trauma: Accidental or iatrogenic (e.g.,

facial laceration, local anesthetic block,
parotid or mastoid surgery).
 Acute or chronic suppurative otitis media.
 Malignant otitis externa: Pseudomonas infec-

tion in diabetic or elderly patients. Begins in
external auditory canal but may progress to
osteomyelitis, meningitis, or abscess.
 Ramsay–Hunt syndrome (varicella zoster

oticus): Viral prodrome followed by ear
pain; vesicles on pinna, external auditory

arthralgias, myalgias, or nausea. There may
or may not be a history of tick bite. See
13.3, Lyme Disease.

 Parotid neoplasm: Slowly progressive paral-

ysis of all or portion of facial musculature.
Parotid mass with facial pain.
 Metastasis:

History of primary tumor
(e.g., breast, lung, prostate). Multiple cranial nerve palsies in rapid succession may
be seen. Can be the result of basilar skull
metastasis or carcinomatous meningitis.

 Bell palsy: Idiopathic seventh nerve palsy.

Most common, but other etiologies must be
ruled out. May have viral prodrome followed
by ear pain, facial numbness, decreased tearing or taste. Facial palsy may be complete or
incomplete and progress over 10 days. May
be recurrent, rarely bilateral. Possible familial predisposition.

10

 Others: Diabetes mellitus, botulism, human

immunodeficiency virus (HIV), syphilis,
Epstein–Barr virus, acute porphyrias, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, collagen–vascular
disease, and others.

Work-Up
1. History: Onset and duration of facial weakness? First episode or recurrence? Facial or
ear pain? Trauma? Stroke? Recent infection? Hearing loss, tinnitus, dizziness, or
vertigo? History of sarcoidosis or cancer?
2. Examine old photographs to determine
chronicity of facial droop.
3. Complete neurologic examination: Determine if facial palsy is central or peripheral,

complete or incomplete. Assess taste with
bitter or sweet solution on anterior twothirds of tongue on affected side. Carefully
assess other cranial nerves, especially the
fifth, sixth, and seventh. Look for motor
weakness and cerebellar signs.
4. Complete ocular examination: Check ocular motility and look for nystagmus. Assess
orbicularis strength bilaterally, degree of
ectropion, and Bell phenomenon. Examine cornea carefully for signs of exposure
(superficial punctate keratopathy, epithelial defect, or ulcer). Perform Schirmer test
(see 4.3, Dry-Eye Syndrome) to assess basic
tear production. Check for signs of uveitis.
5. Otolaryngologic examination: Examine
ear and oropharynx for vesicles, masses, or
other lesions. Palpate parotid for mass or
lymphadenopathy. Check hearing.
6. CT scan if history of trauma to rule out
basilar skull fracture: Axial and coronal
cuts with attention to temporal bone.

10

7. MRI or CT scan of brain if any other associated neurologic signs, history of cancer, or
duration >3 months. Sixth nerve involvement warrants attention to the brainstem.
Eighth nerve involvement warrants attention to the CPA. Multiple cranial nerve
involvement warrants attention to the
skull base.
8. Chest radiograph and angiotensinconverting enzyme (ACE) level if sarcoidosis suspected.
9. Consider Lyme titer, Epstein–Barr virus
titer, RPR, HIV test, and CBC with differential, depending on suspected etiology.
10. Rheumatoid factor, ESR, antinuclear antibody (ANA), and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody if collagen–vascular disease
suspected.
11. Echocardiogram, Holter monitor, carotid
noninvasive studies in patients with a history of stroke.
12. LP in patients with history of primary
neoplasm to rule out carcinomatous meningitis (repeat up to three times if negative to increase sensitivity).

LWBK1000-C10_p242-292.indd 258

Treatment
1. Treat the underlying disease as follows:
—Stroke: Refer to neurologist.
—CPA masses, temporal bone fracture,
nerve laceration: Refer to neurosurgeon.
—Otitis: Refer to otolaryngologist.
—Ramsay–Hunt syndrome: If seen within
72 hours of onset, start acyclovir 800 mg
five times per day for 7 to 10 days (contraindicated in pregnancy and renal failure).
Refer to otolaryngologist.
—Guillain–Barré syndrome: Refer to neurologist. May require urgent hospitalization
for rapidly progressive motor weakness or
respiratory distress.
—Lyme disease: Refer to infectious disease
specialist. May need LP. Treat with oral doxycycline, penicillin, or intravenous (i.v.)
ceftriaxone. See 13.3, Lyme Disease.
—Sarcoidosis: Treat uveitis if present.
Consider brain MRI, LP, or both to rule
out CNS involvement; if present, refer to
neurologist. Refer to internist for systemic
evaluation. May require systemic prednisone for extraocular or CNS disease. See
12.6, Sarcoidosis.
—Metastatic disease: Refer to oncologist.
Systemic chemotherapy, radiation, or both
may be required.
2. Bell palsy: 86% of patients recover completely with observation alone within
2 months. Options for treatment include:
—Facial massage or electrical stimulation of
facial musculature.
—Consider steroids (e.g., prednisone 60 mg
p.o. q.d. for 4 days, tapering to 5 mg q.d.
over 10 days). A short course of acyclovir
or famciclovir, in combination with prednisone, may improve facial nerve function
outcomes.
—Consider referral to otorhinolaryngology for surgical decompression of the facial
nerve.
3. The primary ocular complication of
facial palsy is corneal exposure, which is

23/12/11 1:54 AM

•

Cavernous Sinus and Associated Syndromes

managed as follows (also see 4.5, Exposure
Keratopathy):
—Mild exposure keratitis: Artificial tears
q.i.d. with lubricating ointment q.h.s.
—Moderate exposure keratitis: Preservative-free artificial tears q1–2h, moisture
chamber during the day with lubricating
ointment, or tape tarsorrhaphy q.h.s. Consider a temporary tarsorrhaphy.
—Severe exposure keratitis: Temporary
or permanent tarsorrhaphy. For expected
chronic facial palsy, consider eyelid gold
weight to facilitate eyelid closure.

10.10

259

Follow-Up
1. Recheck all patients at 1 and 3 months and
more frequently if corneal complications
arise.
2. If not resolved after 3 months, order MRI of
brain to rule out mass lesion.
3. In nonresolving facial palsy with repeatedly negative work-up, consider referral
to neurosurgeon or plastic surgeon for
facial nerve graft, cranial nerve reanastomosis, or temporalis muscle transposition
for patients who strongly desire facial
reanimation.

CAVERNOUS SINUS AND ASSOCIATED
SYNDROMES (MULTIPLE OCULAR
MOTOR NERVE PALSIES)

Symptoms

Differential Diagnosis

Double vision, eyelid droop, facial pain, or
numbness.

 Myasthenia gravis: Fatigable ptosis, orbicu-

Signs
Critical. Limitation of eye movement corresponding to any combination of a third,
fourth, or sixth nerve palsy on one side;
facial pain or numbness or both corresponding to one or more branches of the fifth cranial nerve; ptosis and a small pupil (Horner
syndrome); the pupil also may be dilated
if the third cranial nerve is involved. Any
combination of the above may be present
simultaneously because of the anatomy of
the cavernous sinus. All signs involve the
same side of the face when one cavernous
sinus/superior orbital fissure is involved. The
circular sinus connects the cavernous sinuses,
and its involvement can cause contralateral
signs. Consider orbital apex syndrome when
proptosis and optic neuropathy are present.
Other. Proptosis may be present when the
superior orbital fissure is involved.

LWBK1000-C10_p242-292.indd 259

laris weakness, and limited motility. Pupils
uninvolved. No proptosis. See 10.11, Myasthenia Gravis.
 CPEO:

Progressive, painless, bilateral
motility limitation with ptosis. Normal
pupils. Orbicularis always weak. See 10.12,
Chronic Progressive External Ophthalmoplegia.

10

 Orbital lesions (e.g., tumor, thyroid disease,

inflammation). Proptosis and increased
resistance to retropulsion are usually present, in addition to motility restriction.
Results of forced-duction tests are abnormal
(see Appendix 6, Forced-Duction Test and
Active Force Generation Test). May have an
afferent pupillary defect if the optic nerve
is involved.
NOTE: Orbital apex syndrome combines the
superior orbital fissure syndrome with optic
nerve dysfunction, and most commonly results
from an orbital lesion.

Neuro-Ophthalmology

 Brainstem disease: Tumors and vascular

lesions of the brainstem can produce ocular
motor nerve palsies, particularly the sixth
cranial nerve. MRI of the brain is best for
making this diagnosis.
 Carcinomatous meningitis: Diffuse seeding

of the leptomeninges by metastatic tumor
cells can produce a rapidly sequential bilateral cranial nerve disorder. Diagnosis is
made by serial LPs.
 Skull base tumors, especially nasopharyn-

geal carcinoma or clivus lesions: Most commonly affects the sixth cranial nerve, but
the second, third, fourth, and fifth cranial
nerves may be involved as well. Typically,
one cranial nerve after another is affected by
invasion of the base of the skull. The patient
may have cervical lymphadenopathy, nasal
obstruction, ear pain, or popping caused by
serous otitis media or blockage of the Eustachian tube, weight loss, or proptosis.
 Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP): Verti-

cal limitation of eye movements, typically
beginning with downward gaze. Postural
instability, dementia, and rigidity of the neck
and trunk may be present. All eye movements are eventually lost. See 10.12, Chronic
Progressive External Ophthalmoplegia.
 Rare: Myotonic dystrophy, bulbar variant of

10

the Guillain–Barré syndrome (Miller–Fisher
variant), intracranial sarcoidosis, others.

Etiology
 Arteriovenous fistula [carotid–cavernous

(“high-flow”) or dural–cavernous (“lowflow”)]: Proptosis, chemosis, dilated and
tortuous (“corkscrew”) episcleral and conjunctival blood vessels (see Figure 10.10.1).
Intraocular pressure is often increased.
Enhanced ocular pulsation (“pulsatile proptosis”) may be present, usually only discernible on slit-lamp examination during
applanation. A bruit may be heard by the
patient, and sometimes by the physician
if the globe or temple region is auscultated. Reversed, arterialized flow in the
superior ophthalmic vein is detectable
with orbital color Doppler US. Orbital
CT scan or MRI may show an enlarged

LWBK1000-C10_p242-292.indd 260

superior ophthalmic vein. High-flow fistulas have an abrupt onset and are most
commonly caused by trauma or rupture
of an intracavernous aneurysm, whereas
low-flow fistulas have a more insidious
presentation, most commonly in hypertensive women >50 years of age and are
due to dural arteriovenous malformations.
The Barrow classification is used for preoperative planning and further subdivides
carotid–cavernous fistulas as follows:
A. Direct fistula.
B. Indirect with branches solely from internal carotid artery (rare).
C. Indirect with branches solely from
external carotid artery.
D. Indirect with branches from both internal and external carotid arteries (most
common).
 Tumors within the cavernous sinus: May be

primary intracranial neoplasms with local
invasion of the cavernous sinus (e.g., meningioma, pituitary adenoma, craniopharyngioma); or metastatic tumors to the cavernous
sinus, either local (e.g., nasopharyngeal carcinoma, perineural spread of a periocular
squamous cell carcinoma) or distant metastasis (e.g., breast, lung, lymphoma).
NOTE: Previously resected tumors may invade
the cavernous sinus years after resection.
 Intracavernous aneurysm: Usually not rup-

tured. If aneurysm does rupture, the signs
of a carotid–cavernous fistula develop.
 Mucormycosis/zygomycosis: Must be sus-

pected in all diabetic patients, particularly
those in ketoacidosis, and any debilitated
or immunocompromised individual with
multiple cranial nerve palsies, with or
without proptosis. Onset is typically acute.
Bloody nasal discharge may be present,
and nasal examination may reveal a black,
crusty material. This condition is lifethreatening.
 Pituitary apoplexy: Acute onset of the criti-

cal signs listed previously; often bilateral
with severe headache, decreased vision,

Cavernous Sinus and Associated Syndromes

261

Work-Up
1. History: Diabetes? Hypertension? Recent
trauma? Prior cancer (including skin cancer)? Weight loss? Ocular bruit? Recent
infection? Severe headache? Diurnal variation of symptoms?
2. Ophthalmic examination: Careful attention to pupils, extraocular motility, Hertel exophthalmometry, and resistance to
retropulsion.
3. Examine the periocular skin for malignant or locally invasive lesions.
FIGURE 10.10.1. Carotid–cavernous fistula with
dilated and tortuous episcleral and conjunctival vessels.

4. CT scan (axial and coronal views) or MRI
of the sinuses, orbit, and brain, or both.
5. Consider orbital color Doppler imaging if
arteriovenous fistula is suspected.

and possibly bitemporal hemianopsia or
blindness. A preexisting pituitary adenoma
may enlarge during pregnancy, owing to
apoplexy. Peripartum hemorrhage or shock
can cause an infarction of the pituitary
gland, leading to apoplexy of a nontumorous pituitary gland (Sheehan syndrome).
An enlarged sella turcica or an intrasellar
mass, usually with acute hemorrhage, is
seen on CT scan or MRI of the brain.
 Varicella zoster: Patients with the typical

zoster rash may develop ocular motor nerve
palsies as well as a mid-dilated pupil that
reacts better to convergence than to light.
 Cavernous

sinus thrombosis: Proptosis,
chemosis, and eyelid edema. Usually bilateral. Fever, nausea, vomiting, and an altered
level of consciousness often develop. May
result from spread of infection from the
face, mouth, throat, sinus, or orbit. Less
commonly noninfectious, resulting from
trauma or surgery.

 Tolosa–Hunt syndrome: Acute idiopathic

inflammation of the superior orbital fissure or anterior cavernous sinus. Orbital
pain often precedes restriction of eye movements. Recurrent episodes are common.
This is a diagnosis of exclusion.
 Others: Sarcoidosis, Wegener granulomato-

sis, mucocele, tuberculosis, and other infections and inflammatory conditions.

LWBK1000-C10_p242-292.indd 261

If the CT scan and MRI are negative, consider any or all of the following:
6. LP to rule out carcinomatous meningitis in patients with a history of primary
carcinoma. More than one LP might be
required in some cases.
7. Nasopharyngeal examination with or
without a biopsy to rule out nasopharyngeal carcinoma.
8. Lymph node biopsy when lymphadenopathy is present.
9. CBC with differential, ESR, ANA, rheumatoid factor to rule out infection, malignancy,
and systemic vasculitis. Antineutrophilic
cytoplasmic antibody if Wegener granulomatosis is suspected.

10

10. Cerebral arteriography is rarely required
to rule out an aneurysm or arteriovenous
fistula because most of these are seen by
noninvasive imaging studies.
NOTE: Patients suspected of having dural arteriovenous fistulas are recommended to undergo
arteriography to look for cortical venous drainage. If present, this puts the patient at greater
risk for intracranial hemorrhage.

11. If cavernous sinus thrombosis is being
considered, obtain two to three sets
of peripheral blood cultures and also

culture the presumed primary source of
the infection.

Treatment and Follow-Up
Arteriovenous Fistula
1. Many dural fistulas close spontaneously,
with intermittent ipsilateral carotid massage, or after arteriography. Others may
require treatment via interventional neuroradiologic techniques.
2. Resolution of the fistula usually results in
normalization of the intraocular pressure.
However, medical treatment with aqueous
suppressants for secondary glaucoma may
be necessary. Drugs that increase outflow
facility (e.g., latanoprost and pilocarpine)
are usually not as effective because the intraocular pressure is increased as a result of
increased episcleral venous pressure. See
9.1, Primary Open-Angle Glaucoma.
Metastatic Disease to the Cavernous Sinus
Often requires systemic chemotherapy (if a primary is found) with or without radiation therapy to the metastasis. Refer to an oncologist.
Intracavernous Aneurysm
Refer to a neurosurgeon for work-up and possible treatment.

10

Mucormycosis/Zygomycosis
1. Immediate hospitalization because this is a
rapidly progressive, life-threatening disease.
2. Emergent CT scan of the sinuses, orbit, and
brain.
3. Consult Infectious Disease, Neurosurgery,
Otolaryngology, and Endocrinology as
indicated.
4. Begin amphotericin B 0.25 to 0.30 mg/kg
i.v. in D5W slowly over 3 to 6 hours on the
first day, 0.5 mg/kg i.v. on the second day,
and then up to 0.8 to 1.0 mg/kg i.v. q.d.
The duration of treatment is determined by
the clinical condition.
NOTE: Renal status and electrolytes must be
checked before initiating therapy with amphotericin B and then monitored closely during
treatment. Liposomal amphotericin has significantly less renal toxicity.

LWBK1000-C10_p242-292.indd 262

5. A biopsy should be obtained from any
necrotic tissue (e.g., nasopharynx, paranasal sinuses) if mucormycosis/zygomycosis
is suspected.
6. Early surgical debridement of all necrotic
tissue (possibly including orbital exenteration), plus irrigation of the involved areas
with amphotericin B, is often necessary to
eradicate the infection.
7. Treat the underlying medical condition
(e.g., diabetic ketoacidosis), with appropriate consultation as required.
Pituitary Apoplexy
Refer immediately to neurosurgeon for surgical
consideration. These patients are often quite ill
and require immediate steroid therapy.
Varicella Zoster
See 4.16, Herpes Zoster Ophthalmicus/Varicella
Zoster Virus.
Cavernous Sinus Thrombosis
1. For possible infectious cases (usually caused
by Staphylococcus aureus), hospitalize the
patient for treatment with intravenous antibiotics for several weeks. Consult Infectious
Disease for antibiotic management.
2. Intravenous fluid replacement is usually
required.
3. For aseptic cavernous sinus thrombosis, consider systemic anticoagulation (heparin followed by warfarin) or aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.
in collaboration with a medical internist.
4. Exposure keratopathy is treated with
preservative-free lubricating ointment or
drops (see 4.5, Exposure Keratopathy).
5. Treat secondary glaucoma. See 9.1, Primary
Open-Angle Glaucoma.
Tolosa–Hunt Syndrome
Prednisone 60 to 100 mg p.o. q.d. for 2 to
3 days, and then a gradual taper over at least
4 to 6 weeks as the pain subsides. If pain persists after 72 hours, stop steroids and initiate
reinvestigation to rule out other disorders.
NOTE: Other infectious or inflammatory disorders may also respond to steroids initially, so these
patients need to be monitored closely.

Myasthenia Gravis

263

MYASTHENIA GRAVIS

Symptoms

NOTE: Myasthenia may mimic specific cranial
nerve palsies, but the pupil is never involved.

Droopy eyelid or double vision that is variable throughout the day or worse when the
individual is fatigued; may have weakness of
facial muscles, proximal limb muscles, and
difficulty swallowing or breathing.

 Horner syndrome: Miosis accompanies the

Signs

 Levator muscle dehiscence or disinsertion:

Critical. Worsening of ptosis with sustained
upgaze or diplopia with continued eye movements, weakness of the orbicularis muscle
(cannot close the eyelids forcefully to resist
examiner's opening them). No pupillary abnormalities or pain.
Other. Upward twitch of ptotic eyelid when
shifting gaze from inferior to primary position
(Cogan eyelid twitch). Can have complete
limitation of all ocular movements.

Differential Diagnosis
 Eaton–Lambert syndrome: A myasthenia-

like paraneoplastic condition associated
with carcinoma, especially lung cancer.
Isolated eye signs do not occur, although
eye signs may accompany systemic signs
of weakness. Unlike myasthenia, muscle
strength increases after exercise. Electromyography (EMG) distinguishes between the
two conditions.
 Myasthenia-like syndrome due to medica-

tion (e.g., penicillamine, aminoglycosides).
 CPEO: No diurnal variation of symptoms

or relation to fatigue; usually a negative
intravenous edrophonium chloride test.
Typically no diplopia. See 10.12, Chronic
Progressive External Ophthalmoplegia.
 Kearns–Sayre syndrome: CPEO and reti-

nal pigmentary degeneration in a young
person; heart block develops. See 10.12,
Chronic Progressive External Ophthalmoplegia.
 Third nerve palsy: Pupil may be involved,

no orbicularis weakness, no fatigability,
no diurnal variation. See 10.5, Isolated Third
Nerve Palsy.

LWBK1000-C10_p242-292.indd 263

ptosis. Pupil does not dilate well in darkness. See 10.2, Horner Syndrome.
High eyelid crease on the side of the droopy
eyelid, no variability of eyelid droop, no
orbicularis weakness.
 Thyroid eye disease: No ptosis. May have

eyelid retraction or eyelid lag, may or may
not have exophthalmos, no diurnal variation of diplopia. Graves disease occurs in
5% of patients with myasthenia gravis. See
7.2.1, Thyroid Eye Disease.
 Idiopathic orbital inflammatory syndrome:

Proptosis, pain, ocular injection. See 7.2.2,
Idiopathic Orbital Inflammatory Syndrome.
 Myotonic dystrophy: May have ptosis and

rarely, gaze restriction. After a handshake,
these patients are often unable to release
their grip (myotonia). Polychromatic
lenticular deposits, “Christmas tree” cataract and pigmentary retinopathy present.

Etiology

10

Autoimmune disease; sometimes associated
with underlying thyroid dysfunction. May be
associated with occult thymoma. Increased incidence of other autoimmune disease (e.g., lupus,
MS, rheumatoid arthritis). All age groups may
be affected.

Work-Up
1. History: Do the signs fluctuate throughout the day and worsen with fatigue? Any
systemic weakness? Difficulty swallowing,
chewing, or breathing? Medications?
2. Assess for presence of fatigability: Measure the degree of ptosis in primary gaze.
Have the patient focus on your finger in
upgaze for 1 minute. Observe whether the
ptosis worsens.

23/12/11 1:54 AM

Neuro-Ophthalmology

3. Assess orbicularis strength by asking the
patient to squeeze the eyelids shut while
you attempt to force them open.
4. Test pupillary function.
5. Blood test for acetylcholine receptor
antibodies. An elevated antibody titer
establishes the diagnosis of myasthenia.
However, values may be positive in only
60% to 88% of patients with myasthenia
and are less likely to be positive in purely
ocular myasthenia gravis.
6. In adults, edrophonium chloride or
prostigmine tests, ice-pack test (see later),
or rest test (see later) may confirm the
diagnosis. Edrophonium chloride test is
performed as follows:
—Identify one prominent feature (e.g.,
ptosis, diplopia) to observe during test.
Have a cardiac monitor (not portable) and
injectable atropine readily available.
—Inject edrophonium chloride 0.2 mL (2
mg) i.v. Observe for 1 minute. If an improvement in the selected feature is noted, the
test is positive and may be stopped at this
point. If no improvement with the medication develops, continue. Stop immediately
if untoward reaction occurs.

10

—Inject edrophonium chloride 0.4 mL
(4 mg) i.v. Observe for 30 seconds for a
response or side effect. If neither develops, proceed.
—Inject edrophonium chloride 0.4 mL
(4 mg) i.v. If no improvement is noted
within two additional minutes, the test is
negative.

FIGURE 10.11.1. Myasthenia gravis with left

ptosis.

LWBK1000-C10_p242-292.indd 264

—Improvement within the stated time
period is diagnostic of myasthenia
gravis (rarely a patient with CPEO, an
intracavernous tumor, or some other
rare disorder will have a false-positive
result). A negative test does not exclude
myasthenia.
NOTE: Cholinergic crisis, syncopal episode,
and respiratory arrest, although rare, may be
precipitated by the edrophonium chloride test.
Treatment includes atropine 0.4 mg i.v., while
monitoring vital signs. Consider pretreating
with atropine to prevent problems.
Intramuscular prostigmine may be used
instead of edrophonium chloride in children or
in patients where injecting intravenous medication is problematic. The effect has a longer
onset and lasts for approximately 30 minutes.

7. For the ice-pack test, an ice pack is placed
over closed eyes for 2 minutes. Improvement of ptosis by at least 2 mm is a positive test (see Figures 10.11.1 and 10.11.2).
8. In children, observation for improvement immediately after a 1- to 2-hour
nap (sleep test) is a safe alternative. A
similar rest test (keeping eyes closed) for
30 minutes in adults may be similarly
diagnostic.
9. Check swallowing and breathing function and proximal limb muscle strength
to rule out systemic involvement.
10. Thyroid function tests [including thyroidstimulating hormone (TSH)].
11. CT scan of the chest to rule out thymoma.

FIGURE 10.11.2. Myasthenia gravis after ice-pack
test showing resolution of left ptosis.

23/12/11 1:54 AM

10.11

12. Consider ANA, rheumatoid factor, and
other tests to rule out other autoimmune
disease.
13. A single-fiber EMG including the orbicularis muscle may be performed if other
testing is negative and the diagnosis is still
suspected. May be the most sensitive test
for involvement of the ocular muscles.

Treatment
Refer to a neurologist familiar with this disease.
1. If the patient is having difficulty swallowing or breathing, urgent hospitalization for
plasmapheresis, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), and ventilatory support may be
indicated.
2. If the condition is mild, purely ocular, and
is not disturbing to the patient, therapy
need not be instituted (the patient may
patch one eye as needed).
3. If the condition is disturbing or more
severe, an oral anticholinesterase agent
such as pyridostigmine (gradually increasing to a dose of 60 mg p.o. q.i.d. for an
adult) should be given. The dosage must
be adjusted according to the response.
Patients rarely benefit from >120 mg p.o.
q3h of pyridostigmine. Overdosage may
produce cholinergic crisis.
4. If symptoms persist, consider systemic steroids. There is no uniform agreement concerning the dosage. One option is to start
with prednisone 20 mg p.o. q.d., increasing
the dose slowly until the patient is receiving 100 mg/day. These patients may require
hospitalization for several days when a
high-dose regimen of steroids is employed.
NOTE: Steroid use in myasthenia may precipitate respiratory crisis in the first 2 weeks of

treatment. Therefore, in patients with systemic
symptoms, hospitalization to begin steroids is
required.

5. Azathioprine (1 to 2 mg/kg/day) may be
helpful in older patients. Other medications include mycophenolate mofetil and
cyclosporine. Some patients with systemic
myasthenia are treated with regularly
scheduled IVIG or plasmapheresis.
6. Treat any underlying thyroid disease or
infection.
7. Surgical removal of the thymus can be performed. This is indicated for anyone with
thymoma. It may also improve symptoms
in patients with generalized myasthenia
without thymoma.

Follow-Up
1. If systemic muscular weakness is present,
patients need to be monitored every 1 to
4 days by an appropriate medical specialist
until improvement is demonstrated.
2. Patients who have had their isolated ocular abnormality for an extended time
(e.g., months) should be seen every 4 to
6 months and if proven to be stable, every
6 to 12 months.
3. Patients should always be warned to return immediately if swallowing or breathing difficulties arise. After isolated ocular
myasthenia has been present for 2 years,
progression to systemic involvement is
unlikely.

10

NOTE: Newborn infants of myasthenic mothers
should be observed carefully for signs of myasthenia because acetylcholine receptor antibodies
may cross the placenta. Poor sucking reflex, ptosis or decreased muscle tone may be seen.

CHRONIC PROGRESSIVE EXTERNAL
OPHTHALMOPLEGIA

Symptoms
Slowly progressive, symmetric ophthalmoplegia and droopy eyelids. Almost never have
diplopia. Usually bilateral; there is no diurnal
variation; there may be a family history.

Signs
Critical. Ptosis, limitation of ocular motility (sometimes complete limitation), normal
pupils, orthophoric.
Other. Weak orbicularis oculi muscles, weakness of limb and facial muscles, exposure keratopathy.

Differential Diagnosis
See 10.11, Myasthenia Gravis, for a complete
list. The following syndromes must be ruled
out when CPEO is diagnosed:
 Kearns–Sayre syndrome: Onset of CPEO

10

before age 20 years, retinal pigmentary
degeneration with a salt-and-pepper appearance, heart block that usually occurs years
after the ocular signs and may cause sudden
death. Other signs may include hearing
loss, mental retardation, cerebellar signs,
short stature, delayed puberty, nephropathy, vestibular abnormalities, increased
cerebrospinal fluid protein, and characteristic “ragged red fiber” findings on muscle
biopsy. Although some are inherited maternally, the vast majority are due to spontaneous mitochondrial deletions.
 Abetalipoproteinemia

(Bassen–Kornzweig
syndrome): Retinal pigmentary degeneration similar to retinitis pigmentosa, diarrhea, ataxia, and other neurologic signs.
Acanthocytosis of red blood cells are seen
on peripheral blood smear and LP demonstrates increased cerebrospinal fluid
protein. See 11.28, Retinitis Pigmentosa and
Inherited Chorioretinal Dystrophies.

 Refsum

disease: Retinitis pigmentosa
and increased blood phytanic acid level.
May have polyneuropathy, ataxia, hearing

LWBK1000-C10_p242-292.indd 266

loss, anosmia, others. See 11.28, Retinitis
Pigmentosa and Inherited Chorioretinal Dystrophies.
 Oculopharyngeal dystrophy: Difficulty swal-

lowing, sometimes leading to aspiration
of food; may have autosomal dominant
inheritance.
 Mitochondrial myopathy and encepha-

lopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like
episodes (MELAS): Occurs in children and
young adults. May have headache, transient
hemianopia, hemiparesis, nausea, vomiting. Elevated serum and cerebrospinal fluid
lactate levels and may have abnormalities
on MRI.
 Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP; Steele-

Richardson-Olszewski syndrome): Rare progressive neurodegenerative disorder affecting
the brainstem that causes early gait instability and ophthalmoplegia. Often downgaze
affected first followed by other gaze limitations; vertical more than horizontal. Other
eye movement problems include abnormalities in the saccadic and pursuit subsystems of horizontal gaze. Often the eyelids
are held wide open resulting in a “staring”
type of facial expression. Neck and axial
rigidity is an important sign.

Work-Up
1. Careful history: Determine the rate of
onset (gradual versus sudden, as in cranial
nerve disease).
2. Family history.
3. Carefully examine the pupils and ocular
motility.
4. Test orbicularis oculi strength.
5. Fundus examination: Look for diffuse pigmentary changes.
6. Check swallowing function.
7. Edrophonium chloride test, ice-pack test,
or rest test to check for myasthenia gravis.
See 10.11, Myasthenia Gravis.

23/12/11 1:55 AM

10.13

NOTE: Some patients with CPEO are supersensitive to edrophonium chloride which may
precipitate heart block and arrhythmias.

8. Prompt referral to a cardiologist for full
cardiac work-up (including yearly electrocardiograms) if Kearns–Sayre syndrome is
suspected.
9. If neurologic signs and symptoms develop,
consult a neurologist for work-up (including possible LP).
10. Lipoprotein electrophoresis and peripheral blood smear if abetalipoproteinemia
suspected.
11. Serum phytanic acid level if Refsum disease suspected.

•

Internuclear Ophthalmoplegia

267

1. Treat exposure keratopathy with lubricants
at night and artificial tears during the day.
See 4.5, Exposure Keratopathy.
2. Single vision reading glasses or basedown prisms within reading glasses may
help reading when downward gaze is
restricted.
3. In Kearns–Sayre syndrome, a pacemaker
may be required.
4. In oculopharyngeal dystrophy, dysphagia
and aspirations may require cricopharyngeal surgery.
5. In severe ptosis, consider ptosis crutches
or surgical repair, but watch for worsening
exposure keratopathy.
6. Genetic counseling.

Treatment
There is no cure for CPEO, but associated
abnormalities are managed as follows:

10.13

Follow-Up
Depends on ocular and systemic findings.

INTERNUCLEAR OPHTHALMOPLEGIA

Definition
Ophthalmoplegia secondary to lesion in the
medial longitudinal fasciculus (MLF).

Symptoms
Double vision, blurry vision, or vague visual
complaints.

Critical. Weakness or paralysis of adduction,
with horizontal jerk nystagmus of the abducting eye.
NOTE: Internuclear ophthalmoplegia (INO) is localized to the side with the weak adduction.

(See Figures 10.13.1 and 10.13.2.)

Other. A skew deviation (a relatively comitant
vertical deviation not caused by neuromuscular
junction disease or intraorbital pathology). The

three-step test cannot isolate a specific muscle.
Localizes to the posterior fossa. See 10.7, Isolated Fourth Nerve Palsy. Upbeat nystagmus on
upgaze when INO is bilateral. The involved
eye can sometimes turn in when attempting to
read (intact convergence). Unilateral or bilateral (WEBINO: “wall-eyed,” bilateral INO).

Differential Diagnosis of Attenuated Adduction
 Myasthenia

gravis: May closely mimic
INO; however, ptosis and orbicularis oculi
weakness are common. Nystagmus of INO
is faster; myasthenia gravis is more gaze
paretic. Symptoms vary throughout the day.
See 10.11, Myasthenia Gravis.

 Orbital disease (e.g., tumor, thyroid dis-

ease, idiopathic orbital inflammatory syndrome): Proptosis, globe displacement, or
pain may also be present. Nystagmus is usually not present. See 7.1, Orbital Disease.
 One-and-a-half syndrome: Pontine lesion

10

that includes the ipsilateral MLF and horizontal gaze center (sixth nerve nucleus).
The only preserved horizontal movement
is abduction of the eye contralateral to
the lesion. This is because of an ipsilateral
adduction deficit (from the MLF lesion) and
a horizontal gaze paresis in the direction of
the lesion (from the horizontal gaze center
lesion). Causes include stroke and pontine
neoplasia.

Etiology
ally bilateral.
 Brainstem stroke: More common in elderly

patients, usually unilateral.

Work-Up
1. History: Age? Are symptoms constant or
only toward the end of the day with fatigue?
Prior optic neuritis, urinary incontinence,
numbness or paralysis of an extremity, or
another unexplained neurologic event (MS)?
2. Complete evaluation of eye movement
to rule out other eye movement disorders
(e.g., sixth nerve palsy, skew deviation).
NOTE: Ocular motility can appear to be full,
but a muscular weakness can be detected by
observing slower saccadic eye movement in the
involved eye compared with the contralateral
eye. The adducting saccade is assessed by having the patient fix on the examiner's finger held
laterally and then asking the patient to make a
rapid eye movement from lateral to primary
gaze. If an INO is present, the involved eye will
show a slower adducting saccade than the uninvolved eye. The contralateral eye may be tested
in a similar fashion.

3. Edrophonium chloride test, ice-pack test,
or rest test when the diagnosis of myasthenia gravis cannot be ruled out (see 10.11,
Myasthenia Gravis).
4. MRI of the brainstem and midbrain.

1. If an acute stroke is diagnosed, admit to
the hospital for neurologic evaluation and
observation.
2. Otherwise, patients are managed by physicians familiar with the underlying disease.

 Brainstem mass lesion.

OPTIC NEURITIS

Symptoms
Loss of vision over hours (rarely) to days (most
commonly), with the nadir approximately
1 week after onset. Visual loss may be subtle
or profound. Usually unilateral, but may be

LWBK1000-C10_p242-292.indd 268

sis granuloma, pyoderma gangrenosum (all
shown to cause WEBINO).

Treatment/Follow-Up

 MS: More common in young patients, usu-

10.14

 Rare causes: CNS cryptococcosis, tuberculo-

bilateral. Age typically 18 to 45 years. Orbital
pain, especially with eye movement. Acquired
loss of color vision. Reduced perception of
light intensity. May have other focal neurologic symptoms (e.g., weakness, numbness,
tingling in extremities). May have antecedent

23/12/11 1:55 AM

10.14

flulike viral syndrome. Occasionally altered
perception of moving objects (Pulfrich phenomenon), or a worsening of symptoms with
exercise or increase in body temperature
(Uhthoff sign).

Signs
Critical. Relative afferent pupillary defect
in unilateral or asymmetric cases; decreased
color vision; central, cecocentral, arcuate, or
altitudinal visual field defects.
Other. Swollen disc (in one-third of patients)
with or without peripapillary flame-shaped
hemorrhages (papillitis most commonly seen
in children and young adults) or a normal disc
(in two-thirds of patients, retrobulbar optic
neuritis more common in adults). Posterior
vitreous cells possible.

Differential Diagnosis
 Ischemic optic neuropathy: Visual loss is

sudden but in up to 35% of patients may
progress over 4 weeks. Typically, no pain
with ocular motility, though pain may be
present in 10% of cases (compared to 90%
of patients with optic neuritis). Optic nerve
swelling due to nonarteritic ischemic optic
neuropathy (NAION) is initially hyperemic and then becomes pale. Optic nerve
swelling in GCA is diffuse and chalk white.
Patients tend to be older [40 to 60 for
NAION and ≥55 in arteritic ischemic optic
neuropathy (AION)]. See 10.17, Arteritic
Ischemic Optic Neuropathy (Giant Cell Arteritis), and 10.18, Nonarteritic Ischemic Optic
Neuropathy.

 Intracranial mass compressing the afferent

visual pathway: Normal or pale disc, afferent pupillary defect, decreased color vision,
mass evident on CT scan or MRI of the

 Leber hereditary optic neuropathy: Usu-

ally occurs in men in the second or third
decade of life. Patients may have a family
history and present with rapid visual loss of
one and then the other eye within days to
months. Early examination of the disc may
reveal peripapillary telangiectases followed
by optic atrophy. See 10.20, Miscellaneous
Optic Neuropathies.
 Toxic or metabolic optic neuropathy: Pro-

gressive painless bilateral visual loss, may
be secondary to alcohol, malnutrition, various toxins (e.g., ethambutol, chloroquine,
isoniazid, chlorpropamide, heavy metals),
anemia, and others. See 10.20, Miscellaneous Optic Neuropathies.

Etiology
 Idiopathic.
 MS: Frequently optic neuritis is the initial

manifestation of MS. In the absence of
demyelinating lesions on MRI, certain clinical features make MS unlikely including
NLP vision, lack of pain, optic disc edema
(particularly if severe), peripapillary hemorrhage, and retinal exudates.

for 3 years. Steroid therapy only increases the
rapidity of visual return but does not improve
final visual outcome.

2. If MRI shows two or more characteristic demyelinating lesions, treat with the
aforementioned steroid regimen. Refer to
neurologist or neuroophthalmologist for
possible treatment with interferon-b-1a,
glatiramer acetate, or fingolimod within 28
days. Patients with one or more typical signal changes on MRI have a 72% chance of
developing CDMS over 15 years.
FIGURE 10.14.1. MRI of optic neuritis showing
enhancement of the right optic nerve.

3. Complete ophthalmic and neurologic
examinations, including pupillary assessment, color vision evaluation, evaluation for
vitreous cells, and dilated retinal examination with optic nerve assessment.
4. Check blood pressure.
5. Visual field test, preferably automated (e.g.,
Humphrey).
6. Consider the following: CBC, RPR, FTA-ABS,
Lyme titer, ESR ACE level, and chest X-ray.

10

NOTE: NEVER use oral prednisone as a primary
treatment because of increased risk of recurrence.
Interferon b-1a, interferon b-1b, and glatiramer
acetate have been shown to reduce probability of
progression to CDMS in high-risk patients.

3. With a negative MRI, the risk of MS is low,
25% at 15 years. Pulsed intravenous steroid
may still be used to hasten visual recovery,
though may be withheld unless the contralateral eye has preexisting visual compromise or the patient requests treatment and
understands the risks, benefits, and alternatives. Repeat MRI in 3, 6, 9, and 12 months
and then yearly after that.

Treatment

In a patient with a diagnosis of prior MS or
optic neuritis:

If patient seen acutely with no prior history
of MS or optic neuritis:

1. Observation.

1. If MRI reveals at least one typical area of
demyelination, offer pulsed intravenous
steroid in the following regimen within 14
days of decreased vision:
—Methylprednisolone 1 g/day i.v. for 3 days,
then
—Prednisone 1 mg/kg/day p.o. for 11 days,
then
—Taper prednisone over 4 days (20 mg on
day 1, 10 mg on days 2 and 4).
—Antiulcer medication (e.g., ranitidine
150 mg p.o. b.i.d.) for gastric prophylaxis.
NOTE: The Optic Neuritis Treatment Trial (ONTT)
found steroid treatment reduced initial progression to clinically definite multiple sclerosis (CDMS)

LWBK1000-C10_p242-292.indd 270

Follow-Up
1. Reexamine the patient approximately 4 to
6 weeks after presentation and then every 3
to 6 months.
2. Patients at high risk for CDMS, including patients with CNS demyelination on
MRI or a positive neurologic examination,
should be referred to a neurologist or neuroophthalmologist for evaluation and management of possible MS.

PAPILLEDEMA

Definition
Optic disc swelling produced by increased
intracranial pressure.

Symptoms
Episodes of transient, often bilateral visual loss
(lasting seconds), often precipitated after rising
from a lying or sitting position (altering intracranial pressure); headache; double vision;
nausea; vomiting; and, rarely, a decrease in
visual acuity (a mild decrease in visual acuity
can occur in the acute setting if associated with
a macular disturbance). Visual field defects and
severe loss of central visual acuity occur more
often with chronic papilledema.

Signs
(See Figure 10.15.1.)
Critical. Bilaterally swollen, hyperemic discs
(in early papilledema, disc swelling may be

asymmetric) with nerve fiber layer edema
causing blurring of the disc margin, often
obscuring the blood vessels.
Other. Papillary or peripapillary retinal hemorrhages (often flame shaped); loss of venous
pulsations (20% of the normal population do
not have venous pulsations); dilated, tortuous
retinal veins; normal pupillary response and
color vision; an enlarged physiologic blind
spot or other visual field defects by formal
visual field testing.
In chronic papilledema, the hemorrhages
and cotton-wool spots resolve, disc hyperemia
disappears and the disc becomes gray in color,
peripapillary gliosis and narrowing of the peripapillary retinal vessels occur, and optociliary
shunt vessels may develop on the disc. Loss of
color vision, central visual acuity, and visual
field defects, especially inferonasally, also
occur.

10

NOTE: Unilateral or bilateral sixth nerve palsy also
may result from increased intracranial pressure.

Differential Diagnosis of
Disc Edema or Elevation
 Pseudopapilledema (e.g., optic disc drusen

or congenitally anomalous disc): Not true
disc swelling. Vessels overlying the disc are
not obscured, the disc is not hyperemic,
and the surrounding nerve fiber layer is
normal. Spontaneous venous pulsations are
often present. Buried drusen may be present and can be identified with B-scan US.
 Papillitis:

cases, usually unilateral. See 10.14, Optic
Neuritis.
 Hypertensive optic neuropathy: Extremely

high blood pressure, narrowed arterioles,
arteriovenous crossing changes, hemorrhages with or without cotton-wool spots
extending into the peripheral retina. See
11.10, Hypertensive Retinopathy.
 Central retinal vein occlusion: Hemor-

rhages extend far beyond the peripapillary area, dilated and tortuous veins,
generally unilateral, acute loss of vision in
most cases. See 11.8, Central Retinal Vein
Occlusion.

 Thyroid-related optic neuropathy: May have

eyelid lag or retraction, ocular misalignment, resistance to retropulsion. See 7.2.1,
Thyroid Eye Disease.
 Uveitis (e.g., syphilis or sarcoidosis): Pain or

photophobia, anterior chamber, and vitreous cells. See 12.3, Posterior Uveitis.
 Amiodarone toxicity: May present with

subacute visual loss and disc edema.
NOTE: Optic disc swelling in a patient with leukemia is often a sign of leukemic optic nerve infiltration. Immediate radiation therapy is usually
required to preserve vision.

 Ischemic optic neuropathy: Disc swelling is

pale but may be hyperemic; initially unilateral unless due to GCA, with sudden visual
loss. See 10.17, Arteritic Ischemic Optic Neuropathy (Giant Cell Arteritis) and 10.18, Nonarteritic Ischemic Optic Neuropathy.
 Infiltration of the optic disc (e.g., sarcoid or

tuberculous granuloma, leukemia, metastasis, other inflammatory disease or tumor):
Other ocular or systemic abnormalities may
be present. Usually unilateral.
 Leber hereditary optic neuropathy: Usu-

10

ally occurs in men in the second or third
decade of life. Patients may have a family
history and present with rapid visual loss of
one and then the other eye within days to
months. Early examination of the disc may
reveal peripapillary telangiectases followed
by optic atrophy. See 10.20, Miscellaneous
Optic Neuropathies.
 Orbital optic nerve tumors: Unilateral disc

swelling, may have proptosis. See 10.20,
Miscellaneous Optic Neuropathies.
 Diabetic papillopathy: Benign disc edema

in one or both eyes of a diabetic patient,
most commonly with mild visual loss. No
correlation with diabetic retinopathy. In
addition to disc edema, disc hyperemia
due to telangiectasis of the disc vessels may
occur, simulating neovascularization. More
common in patients with juvenile-onset
diabetes. No treatment is indicated. Spontaneous resolution usually occurs after 3 to
4 months.

LWBK1000-C10_p242-292.indd 272

Etiology
 Primary and metastatic intracranial tumors.
 Hydrocephalus.
 Idiopathic intracranial hypertension: Often

occurs in young, overweight females. See
10.16, Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension/
Pseudotumor Cerebri.
 Subdural and epidural hematomas.
 Subarachnoid hemorrhage: Severe headache,

may have preretinal hemorrhages (Terson
syndrome).
 Arteriovenous malformation.
 Brain abscess: Often produces high fever

and mental status changes.
 Meningitis: Fever, stiff neck, headache (e.g.,

syphilis, tuberculosis, Lyme disease, bacterial,
inflammatory, neoplastic).
 Encephalitis: Often produces mental status

abnormalities.
 Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis.

Work-Up
1. History and physical examination, including blood pressure measurement.
2. Ocular examination, including a pupillary
and color vision (using color plates) assessment, posterior vitreous evaluation for white
blood cells, and a dilated fundus examination. The optic disc is best examined with a

23/12/11 1:55 AM

slit lamp and a Hruby, fundus contact, or
60-diopter lens.
3. Emergency MRI with gadolinium and magnetic resonance venography (MRV) of the
head are preferred. CT scan (axial and coronal views) may be done if MRI not available
emergently.

10.16

273

4. LP with CSF analysis and opening pressure
measurement if the CT or MRI/MRV do not
reveal a mass lesion or hydrocephalus.

Treatment
Treatment should be directed at the underlying
cause of the increased intracranial pressure.

IDIOPATHIC INTRACRANIAL
HYPERTENSION/PSEUDOTUMOR CEREBRI

Definition
A syndrome in which patients present with
symptoms and signs of elevated intracranial
pressure, the nature of which may be either
idiopathic or due to various causative factors.

Symptoms
Headache, transient episodes of visual loss
(typically lasting seconds) often precipitated
by changes in posture, double vision, pulsatile
tinnitus, nausea, or vomiting accompanying
the headache. Occurs predominantly in obese
women.

Signs
Critical. By definition, the following findings are present:
 Papilledema due to increased intracranial

pressure.
 Negative MRI/MRV of the brain.
 Increased opening pressure on LP with nor-

mal CSF composition.
Other. See 10.15, Papilledema. Unilateral or
bilateral sixth nerve palsy may be present.
There are no signs on neurologic examination
besides possible sixth nerve palsy.

Differential Diagnosis
See 10.15, Papilledema.

Associated Factors
Obesity, significant weight gain, and pregnancy are often associated with the idiopathic
form. Possible causative factors include various
medications, including oral contraceptives,

LWBK1000-C10_p242-292.indd 273

tetracyclines (including semisynthetics, e.g.,
minocycline), nalidixic acid, cyclosporine,
and vitamin A (>100,000 U/day). Systemic steroid withdrawal may also be causative.

Work-Up
1. History: Inquire specifically about medications.
2. Ocular examination, including pupillary
examination, ocular motility, color vision
testing (color plates), and optic nerve evaluation.
3. Systemic examination, including blood
pressure and temperature.
4. MRI/MRV of the orbit and brain. Any patient
with papilledema needs to be imaged immediately. If normal, the patient should have
an LP, to rule out other causes of optic nerve
edema and to determine the opening pressure (see 10.15, Papilledema).

10

5. Visual field test is the most important
method for following these patients (e.g.,
Humphrey).

Treatment
Idiopathic intracranial hypertension may be a
self-limited process. Treatment is indicated in
the following situations:
 Severe, intractable headache.
 Evidence of progressive decrease in visual

acuity or visual field loss.
 Some ophthalmologists suggest treating all

patients with papilledema.

Neuro-Ophthalmology

Methods of treatment include the following:
1. Weight loss if overweight.
2. Acetazolamide 250 mg p.o. q.i.d. initially,
building up to 500 mg q.i.d. if tolerated.
Use with caution in sulfa-allergic patients.
3. Discontinuation of any causative medication.
If treatment by these methods is unsuccessful, one of the following may be tried:
4. A short course of systemic steroids in
preparation for surgery.
5. Optic nerve sheath decompression surgery
is often effective if vision is threatened and
has been reported to improve headache in
approximately 50% of patients.
6. A neurosurgical shunt (ventriculoperitoneal or lumboperitoneal) should be
performed if intractable headache is a
prominent symptom.

Special Circumstances
1. Pregnancy: Incidence of idiopathic intracranial hypertension does not increase during

10

10.17

pregnancy beyond what would be expected
from the weight gain. No increased risk of
fetal loss. Acetazolamide may be used after
20 weeks gestation (in consultation with
OB/GYN). Intense weight loss is contraindicated during pregnancy. Without visual
compromise, close observation with serial
visual fields is recommended. With visual
compromise, consider steroids, optic nerve
sheath decompression, shunting, or repeat
LPs.
2. Children/adolescents: A secondary cause is
identifiable in 50%.

Follow-Up
1. If acute, patients can be monitored every
3 months in the absence of visual field
loss. If chronic, initially follow patient
every 3 to 4 weeks to monitor visual acuity and visual fields, and then every 3
months, depending on the response to
treatment.
2. In general, the frequency of follow-up
depends on the severity of visual loss.
The more severe, the more frequent the
follow-up.

ARTERITIC ISCHEMIC OPTIC NEUROPATHY
(GIANT CELL ARTERITIS)

Symptoms

Differential Diagnosis
See 10.17, Arteritic Ischemic Optic Neuropathy
(Giant Cell Arteritis).

Etiology
Idiopathic: Arteriosclerosis, diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, hyperhomocysteinemia, anemia, and sleep apnea are associated
risk factors, but causation has never been
proven. Relative nocturnal hypotension may
play a role, especially in patients taking antihypertensive medication. Nocturnal hypotension may be related to sleep apnea.

POSTERIOR ISCHEMIC
OPTIC NEUROPATHY

Symptoms
Painless visual loss. Most commonly occurs
in the postoperative setting at any time from
upon awakening from anesthesia to 4 to
7 days thereafter. May be unilateral or bilateral,
with a partial or complete deficit.

Signs
See 10.18, Nonarteritic Ischemic Optic Neuropathy. Optic discs may appear normal initially in
acute posterior ischemic optic neuropathy, but
eventually pale disc edema, followed by pallor,
develops.

Etiology
 Postoperative: May occur after head and neck

surgery, spinal surgery, gastrointestinal surgery, open heart surgery, or any procedure
in which hypotension, anemia, positioning
of head in dependent, down-tilt position,
increased surgical time, large amounts of
blood loss, or increased central venous pressure occur. History of peripheral vascular disease, diabetes, and anemia may increase risk.

LWBK1000-C10_p242-292.indd 277

NOTE: Operative planning in high-risk patients
should include: attention to head positioning
and length of surgical time, balance of risk and
benefits of hypotensive anesthesia, aggressive
replacement of blood loss, monitoring vision
early in the postoperative period, and prompt
ophthalmic consultation if patient describes
visual disturbances.

10

 Inflammatory/infectious:

GCA, varicella
zoster, systemic lupus erythematosus, and
others.

Treatment
1. Although no controlled studies exist for
postoperative posterior ischemic optic
neuropathy, it has been suggested that
prompt blood transfusion with correction
of hypotension and anemia may be beneficial and should be considered.
2. Treat any inflammatory or infectious etiology as appropriate.

NYSTAGMUS

Nystagmus is divided into congenital and
acquired forms.

Symptoms
Congenital and acquired nystagmus may be
symptomatic with decreased visual acuity.
The environment may be noted to oscillate
horizontally, vertically, or torsionally in cases
of acquired nystagmus, but only rarely in congenital cases.

Signs

 Latent nystagmus (see below).
 Nystagmus Blockage Syndrome (see below).

Critical. Repetitive oscillations of the eye
horizontally, vertically, or torsionally.

Etiology

 Jerk nystagmus: The eye repetitively slowly

 Albinism: Iris transillumination defects and

drifts in one direction (slow phase) and
then rapidly returns to its original position
(fast phase).
 Pendular nystagmus: Drift occurs in two

phases of equal speed, giving a smooth
back-and-forth movement of the eye.

CONGENITAL FORMS OF NYSTAGMUS
Infantile Nystagmus

10

nystagmus appearing between 6 months
and 3 years of age and resolving between
2 and 8 years of age. Unilateral, bilateral
(but asymmetric), or alternating. Spasmus
nutans is a benign condition; however,
gliomas of the anterior visual pathway may
produce an identical clinical picture and
need to be ruled out with MRI.

Onset by age 2 to 3 months with wide, swinging eye movements. At age 4 to 6 months,
small pendular eye movements are added. At
age 6 to 12 months, jerk nystagmus and a null
point (a position of gaze where the nystagmus
is minimized) develop. Compensatory head
positioning may develop at any point up to
20 years of age. Infantile nystagmus is usually
horizontal and uniplanar (same direction in
all gazes), and typically dampens with convergence. May have a latent component (worsens
when one eye is occluded).

Differential Diagnosis
 Opsoclonus/saccadomania: Repetitive, con-

jugate, multidirectional eye movements
associated with cerebellar or brainstem disease, postviral encephalitis, visceral carcinoma, or neuroblastoma.
 Spasmus nutans: Head nodding and head

turn with vertical, horizontal, or torsional

 Idiopathic.

foveal hypoplasia. See 13.8, Albinism.
 Aniridia: Bilateral, near-total congenital iris

absence. See 8.12, Developmental Anterior
Segment and Lens Anomalies/Dysgenesis.
 Leber

congenital amaurosis: Markedly
abnormal or flat electroretinogram (ERG).

 Others: Bilateral optic nerve hypoplasia,

bilateral congenital cataracts, rod monochromatism, or optic nerve or macular disease.

Work-Up
1. History: Age of onset? Head nodding or
head positioning? Known ocular or systemic
abnormalities? Medications? Family history?
2. Complete ocular examination: Observe the
head position and eye movements, check
iris transillumination, and carefully inspect
the optic disc and macula.
3. Consider obtaining an eye movement recording if the diagnosis is uncertain.
4. If opsoclonus is present, obtain a urinary
vanillylmandelic acid and an abdominal
and chest CT scan to rule out neuroblastoma and visceral carcinoma.
5. In selected cases and in all cases of suspected spasmus nutans, obtain an MRI of the
brain (axial and coronal views) to rule out
an anterior optic pathway lesion.

Treatment
1. Maximize vision by refraction.

benzodiazepines, phencyclidine, other anticonvulsants or sedatives, Wernicke encephalopathy, thiamine deficiency.
 CNS disorders: Thalamic hemorrhage, tumor,

stroke, trauma, MS, and others.
 Nonphysiologic: Voluntary, rapid, horizon-

tal, small oscillatory movements of the eyes
that usually cannot be sustained >30 seconds
without fatigue.

Latent Nystagmus
Occurs only when one eye is viewing. Conjugate horizontal nystagmus with fast phase
beating toward viewing eye.
Manifest latent nystagmus occurs in children with strabismus or decreased vision in
one eye, in whom the nonfixating or poorly
seeing eye behaves as an occluded eye.
NOTE: When testing visual acuity in one eye, fog
(e.g., add plus lenses in front of) rather than occluding the opposite eye to minimize induction of latent
nystagmus.

Treatment
1. Maximize vision by refraction.
2. Treat amblyopia if indicated.
3. Consider muscle surgery if symptomatic
strabismus or cosmetically significant head
turn exists.

Nystagmus Blockage Syndrome
Any nystagmus that decreases when the fixating eye is in adduction and demonstrates an
esotropia to dampen the nystagmus.

Treatment
For large face turn, consider muscle surgery.

ACQUIRED FORMS OF NYSTAGMUS
Etiology
 Visual loss (e.g., dense cataract, trauma,

cone dystrophy): Usually monocular and
vertical nystagmus (Heimann–Bielschowsky
phenomenon).
 Toxic/metabolic: Alcohol intoxication, lith-

ium, barbiturates, phenytoin, salicylates,

LWBK1000-C10_p242-292.indd 281

Nystagmus with Localizing Neuroanatomic
Significance
 See-saw: One eye rises and intorts while the

other descends and extorts. Lesion typically
involves the parasellar region and chiasm.
Typically pendular when chiasmal region
involved, and jerk if involving the midbrain. One proposal suggests a unilateral
lesion of the interstitial nucleus of Cajal
or its connections are responsible for this
nystagmus subtype. May have a bitemporal
hemianopia resulting from chiasmal compression. May be congenital or associated
with septo-optic dysplasia.
 Convergence retraction: Convergence-like

eye movements accompanied by globe
retraction when the patient attempts an
upward saccade. May be associated with
limitation of upward gaze, eyelid retraction,
and bilateral mid-dilated pupils that react
poorly to light but constrict better with
convergence. Papilledema may be present.
Usually, a pineal region tumor or other dorsal midbrain abnormality is responsible. See
10.4, Adie (Tonic) Pupil.

10

 Upbeat: The fast phase of the nystagmus is

up. If present in primary gaze, the lesion
typically involves the brainstem or anterior
vermis of the cerebellum. If present only
in upgaze, the most likely etiology is drug
effect.
 Gaze evoked: Absent in primary gaze,

but appears as the eyes look to the side.
Nystagmus increases when looking in the
direction of fast phase. Slow frequency.
Most commonly the result of alcohol
intoxication, sedatives, cerebellar or brainstem disease.

Neuro-Ophthalmology

 Downbeat: The fast phase of nystagmus

is down and most prominent looking
down and to the right and left. Most
commonly, the lesion is at the cervicomedullary junction (e.g., Arnold–Chiari
malformation) or a manifestation of cerebellar degeneration.
 Periodic alternating: In primary position,

fast eye movements are in one direction
for 60 to 90 seconds and then reverse direction for 60 to 90 seconds. The cycle repeats
continuously. Patients may attempt to
minimize nystagmus with periodic head
turning. May be congenital. Acquired
forms are most commonly the result of
lesions of the cervicomedullary junction
and posterior fossa. Other causes include
MS, medication side effects, and rarely
blindness.
 Peripheral vestibular: Horizontal or hori-

10

zontal rotary nystagmus. May be accompanied by vertigo, tinnitus, or deafness.
May be due to dysfunction of vestibular
end organ (inner ear disease), eighth cranial nerve, or eighth nerve nucleus in
brainstem. Destructive lesions produce fast
phases opposite to lesion. Irritative lesions
(e.g., Meniere disease) produce fast phase in
the same direction as the lesion. Vestibular
nystagmus associated with interstitial keratitis is called Cogan syndrome.
 Spasmus nutans: See above.

internist for hematologic evaluation before
carbamazepine use and periodic evaluation
during therapy.
 Opsoclonus/saccadomania: Rapid, chaotic

conjugate saccades. Etiology in children is
a paraneoplastic effect of neuroblastoma or
encephalitis. In adults, in addition to paraneoplastic or infectious, it can be seen with
drug intoxication or following infarction.

Work-Up
1. History: Nystagmus, strabismus, or amblyopia in infancy? Oscillopsia? Drug or alcohol
use? Vertigo? Episodes of weakness, numbness, or decreased vision in the past? MS?
2. Family history: Nystagmus? Albinism? Eye
disorder?
3. Complete ocular examination: Careful
motility examination. Slit-lamp or optic
disc observation may be helpful in subtle
cases. Iris transillumination should be performed to rule out albinism.
4. Obtain an eye movement recording if diagnosis unclear.
5. Visual field examination, particularly with
see-saw nystagmus.
6. Consider a drug/toxin/nutritional screen of
the urine, serum, or both.
7. CT scan or MRI as needed with careful
attention to appropriate area of interest.

 Others:

Rebound nystagmus (cerebellar
lesions), Bruns nystagmus (cerebellopontine
angle), oculomasticatory myorhythmia
(Whipple disease), oculopalatal myoclonus
(prior brainstem stroke).

NOTE: The cervicomedullary junction and cerebellum are best evaluated with sagittal MRI.

Treatment
1. The underlying etiology must be treated.

Differential Diagnosis
 Superior oblique myokymia: Small, uni-

lateral, vertical, and torsional movements
of one eye can be seen with a slit lamp or
ophthalmoscope. Patients complain of unilateral oscillopsia. Symptoms and signs are
more pronounced when the involved eye
looks inferonasally. Usually benign, resolving spontaneously, but rarely due to a mass
lesion so consider neuroimaging. Consider
carbamazepine 200 mg p.o. t.i.d. Consult

LWBK1000-C10_p242-292.indd 282

2. The nystagmus of periodic alternating nystagmus may respond to baclofen. Baclofen
is not recommended for pediatric use.
3. Although controversial, severe, disabling
nystagmus can be treated with retrobulbar
injections of botulinum toxin.

Follow-Up
Appropriate follow-up time is dictated by the
condition responsible for the nystagmus.

Doppler US which may reveal a retrolaminar central retinal artery stenosis or embolus
proximal to the lamina cribrosa. MRA or
CTA may also be considered and may be
superior to duplex Doppler US but cannot
similarly evaluate flow.
6. CBC with differential, fasting blood sugar,
glycosylated hemoglobin, and lipid profile
(to rule out polycythemia, thrombocytosis,
diabetes, and hyperlipidemia).
7. Cardiac evaluation including an echocardiogram.

Treatment
1. Carotid disease.
—Consider aspirin 81 mg or 325 mg p.o.
q.d.
—Consult Vascular Surgery in select
patients if a surgically accessible, high-grade

carotid stenosis is present for consideration
of carotid endarterectomy or endovascular
stent.
—Control hypertension and diabetes
(follow-up with a medical internist).
—Lifestyle modification (e.g., smoking cessation).
2. Cardiac disease.
—Consider aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.
—Consider hospitalization and anticoagulation (e.g., heparin therapy) in the presence of a mural thrombus.
—Consider referral to Cardiac Surgery as
needed.
—Control arteriosclerotic risk factors
(follow-up with medical internist).
3. If carotid and cardiac disease are ruled out,
a vasospastic etiology can be considered
(extremely rare). Treatment with a calcium
channel blocker may be beneficial.

Follow-Up
Patients with recurrent episodes of amaurosis
fugax (especially if accompanied by signs of
cerebral TIA) require immediate diagnostic
and sometimes therapeutic attention.

VERTEBROBASILAR ARTERY INSUFFICIENCY

Symptoms
Transient, bilateral blurred vision usually lasting
a few seconds, sometimes accompanied by flashing lights. Ataxia, vertigo, dysarthria or dysphasia,
perioral numbness, and hemiparesis or hemisensory loss may accompany the visual symptoms.
History of drop attacks (the patient suddenly
falls to the ground without warning or loss of
consciousness). Recurrent attacks are common.

Signs
May have a hemianopsia, ocular motility deficits, or nystagmus, but often presents with a
normal ocular examination.

NONPHYSIOLOGIC VISUAL LOSS

Symptoms
Loss of vision. Malingerers frequently are
involved with an insurance claim or are looking for other forms of financial gain. Those
with psychogenic visual loss truly believe they
have lost vision.

Signs
Critical. No ocular or neuroophthalmic
findings that would account for the decreased
vision. Normal pupillary light reaction.

Differential Diagnosis
 Amblyopia: Poor vision in one eye since

childhood, rarely both eyes. Patient often
has strabismus or anisometropia. Vision is
no worse than counting fingers, especially
in the temporal periphery of an amblyopic
eye. See 8.7, Amblyopia.
 Cortical blindness: Bilateral complete or

severe visual loss with normal pupils. See
10.24, Cortical Blindness.
 Retrobulbar optic neuritis: Afferent pupillary

defect is present. See 10.14, Optic Neuritis.
 Cone–rod dystrophy: Positive family his-

10

tory, decreased color vision, abnormal
results on dark adaptation studies and multifocal ERG. See 11.29, Cone Dystrophies.
 Chiasmal tumor: Visual loss may precede

optic atrophy. Pupils usually react sluggishly
to light, and an afferent pupillary defect is
usually present. Visual fields are abnormal.
 Cancer- or melanoma-associated retinopa-

thy (CAR or MAR): Immune-mediated attack
of photoreceptors. Fundus often appears
normal. Abnormal ERG.

Work-Up
The following tests may be used to diagnose
a patient with nonphysiologic visual loss (to
prove the malingerer or hysteric can see better
than he or she admits to seeing).
Two codes are used in the list below:
U: This test may be used in patients feigning unilateral decreased vision;

LWBK1000-C10_p242-292.indd 286

B: This test may be used in patients feigning bilateral vision loss.
Patients Claiming No Light Perception
Determine whether each pupil reacts to light
(U): When only one eye has no light perception, its pupil will not react to light. The pupil
should not appear dilated unless the patient
has bilateral lack of light perception or third
nerve involvement.
Patients Claiming Hand Motion to No
Light Perception
1. Test for an afferent pupillary defect (U): A
defect should be present in unilateral or
asymmetric visual loss to this degree. If not,
the diagnosis of nonphysiologic visual loss
is made.
2. Mirror test (U or B): If the patient claims
unilateral visual loss, cover the better-seeing
eye with a patch; with bilateral complaints
leave both uncovered. Ask the patient to
hold eyes still and slowly tilt a large mirror
from side to side in front of the eyes, holding it beyond the patient's range of handmotion vision. If the eyes move, the patient
can see better than hand motion.
3. Optokinetic test (U or B): Patch the uninvolved eye when unilateral visual loss is
claimed. Ask the patient to look straight
ahead and slowly move an optokinetic tape
in front of the eyes (or rotate an optokinetic drum). If nystagmus can be elicited,
vision is better than counting fingers.
4. Worth four-dot test (U): Place red-green
glasses on patient and quickly turn on
four-dot pattern and ask patient how many
dots are seen. If the patient closes one eye
(cheating), try reversing the glasses and repeating test. If all four dots are seen, vision
is better than hand motion.
Patients Claiming 20/40 to 20/400 Vision
1. Visual acuity testing (U or B): Start with the
20/10 line and ask the patient to read it.
When the patient claims inability to read
it, look amazed and then offer reassurance.

23/12/11 1:55 AM

10.26

Headache

287

Inform the patient you will go to a larger
line and show the 20/15 line. Again, force
the patient to work to see this line. Slowly
proceed up the chart, asking the patient to
read each line as you pass it (including the
three or four 20/20 lines). It may help to
express disbelief that the patient cannot
read such large letters. By the time the 20/30
or 20/40 lines are reached, the patient may
in fact read one or two letters correctly. The
visual acuity can then be recorded.

Children
1. Tell the child that there is an eye abnormality, but the strong drops about to be administered will cure it. Dilate the child's eyes
(e.g., tropicamide 1%) and retest the visual
acuity in 40 minutes. Children, as well as
adults, sometimes need a “way out.” Provide a reward (bribe them).

2. Fog test (U): Dial the patient's refractive correction into the phoropter. Add +4.00 to
the normally seeing eye. Put the patient in
the phoropter with both eyes open. Tell the
patient to use both eyes to read each line,
starting at the 20/15 line and working up the
chart slowly, as described previously. Record
visual acuity with both eyes open (this
should be visual acuity of supposedly poorly
seeing eye) and document the vision of the
“good eye” through the +4.00 lens to prove
the vision obtained was from the “bad eye.”

1. Patients must be told the truth regarding
the nature of their condition.

3. Retest visual acuity in the supposedly poorly
seeing eye at 10 feet from the chart (U or
B): Vision should be twice as good (e.g., a
patient with 20/100 vision at 20 feet should
read 20/50 at 10 feet). If it is better than
expected, record the better vision. If it worse,
the patient has nonphysiologic visual loss.
4. Test near vision (U or B): If normal near
vision can be documented, nonphysiologic
visual loss or myopia has been documented.
5. Visual field testing (U or B): Goldmann
visual field tests often reveal inconsistent
responses and nonphysiologic field losses.

10.26

Treatment

2. Patients are usually told that no ocular
abnormality can be found that accounts for
their decreased vision.
3. Hysterical patients often benefit from being
told that their vision can be expected to
return to normal by their next visit. Psychiatric referral is sometimes indicated.

Follow-Up
1. If nonphysiologic visual loss is highly suspected but cannot be proven, reexamine in
1 to 2 weeks.
2. Consider obtaining an ERG, visual-evoked
response (VER), ocular coherence tomography (OCT), or an MRI of the brain.
3. If functional visual loss can be documented,
have the patient return as needed.

10

NOTE: Always try to determine the patient's
actual visual acuity if possible and carefully document your findings. Many patients with nonphysiologic visual loss have an underlying organic
component that must be diagnosed and treated.

HEADACHE

Most headaches are not dangerous or ominous; however, they can be symptoms of a
life- or vision-threatening problem. Accompanying signs and symptoms that may indicate
a life- or vision-threatening headache and
some of the specific signs and symptoms of
various headaches are listed below.

Etiology
Life or Vision Threatening
 GCA: Age ≥55 years. May have high ESR,
CRP, and platelets. See 10.17, Arteritic Ischemic Optic Neuropathy (Giant Cell Arteritis).

 Increased intracranial pressure: May have

papilledema and/or a sixth cranial nerve

changes, photophobia, neurologic signs.
 Structural abnormality of the brain (e.g.,

tumor, aneurysm, arteriovenous malformation): Mental status change, signs of
increased intracranial pressure, or neurologic signs during, and often after, the headache episode.
 Subarachnoid hemorrhage: Extremely severe

headache, stiff neck, mental status change;
rarely, subhyaloid hemorrhages seen on fundus examination, usually from a ruptured
aneurysm.
 Epidural or subdural hematoma: Follows

head trauma; altered level of consciousness;
may produce anisocoria.

Work-Up
1. History: Location, intensity, frequency, possible precipitating factors, and time of day of
the headaches? Determine the patient's age
of onset, what relieves the headaches, and
whether there are any associated signs or
symptoms. Specifically ask about concerning symptoms and signs listed above. Also,
trauma, medications and birth-control pills,
family history of migraine, and motion sickness or cyclic vomiting as a child?
2. Complete ocular examination, including
pupillary, motility, and visual field evaluation; intraocular pressure measurement,

NOTE: The presence of spontaneous venous
pulsations indicates normal intracranial pressure
at that moment; however, the absence of pulsations has little significance. About 20% of normal
individuals do not have spontaneous venous pulsations. If there are spontaneous venous pulsations, at that moment, the intracranial pressure
is <220 mm H2O.

3. Neurologic examination (check neck flexibility and other meningeal signs).
4. Palpate the temporal arteries for tenderness,
swelling, and hardness. Ask specifically about
jaw claudication, scalp tenderness, temporal headaches, and unexpected weight loss.
Immediate ESR, CRP, and platelet count when
GCA is suspected [see 10.17, Arteritic Ischemic
Optic Neuropathy (Giant Cell Arteritis)].
5. Temperature and blood pressure.
6. Refer the patient to a neurologist, otolaryngologist, or internist, as indicated.

Treatment/Follow-Up
See individual sections.

10.27

MIGRAINE

Symptoms
Typically unilateral (although it may occur
behind both eyes or across the entire front
of the head), throbbing or boring head pain
accompanied at times by nausea, vomiting,
mood changes, fatigue, or photophobia. An
aura with visual disturbances, including flashing (zig-zagging) lights, blurred vision, or a
visual field defect lasting 15 to 50 minutes,
may precede the migraine. May experience
temporary or permanent neurologic deficits, such as paralysis, numbness, tingling, or
others. A family history is common. Motion
sickness or cyclic vomiting as a child is also

LWBK1000-C10_p242-292.indd 289

common. Migraine in children may be seen
as recurrent abdominal pain and malaise. Of
these patients, 60% to 70% are girls.
Migraine prevalence is highest between
ages 30 and 39 years and progressively declines
after age 40. Migraine attacks may be shorter
and less typical with advancing age. Newonset migraines are uncommon after the age
of 50, and these patients should be worked up
for secondary causes such as vascular lesions,
intracranial hemorrhages, infarcts, masses, or
GCA.
NOTE: Most unilateral migraine headaches at some
point change sides of the head. Headaches always

Neuro-Ophthalmology

on the same side of the head may have another
cause of headache (e.g., intracranial structural
lesions).
Determine if headache precedes visual symptoms, which is more common with arteriovenous
malformations, mass lesions with cerebral edema,
or seizure foci.

Signs
Usually none. Complicated migraines may
have a permanent neurologic or ocular deficit
(see the following discussion).

Differential Diagnosis
See 10.26, Headache.

International Classification
Consult International Classification of Headache Disorders, 2nd edition, for further information.
1. Migraine without aura (common migraine;
80%): Lasts 4 to 72 hours. Unilateral location, pulsating quality, moderate-to-severe
pain, and/or aggravation by physical activity. Nausea, vomiting, photophobia, and
phonophobia.

10

2. Migraine with typical aura (classic migraine;
10%): Fully reversible binocular visual
symptoms that may be perceived as monocular (e.g., flickering lights, spots, lines,
loss of vision) or fully reversible unilateral
sensory symptoms (e.g., numbness, “pins
and needles”). Symptoms gradually develop
over 5 minutes and last between 5 and
60 minutes. No motor symptoms are present.
3. Typical aura without headache (acephalgic
migraine): Visual or sensory symptoms as
above without accompanying or subsequent headache.
4. Familial hemiplegic and sporadic hemiplegic
migraine: Migraine with aura as above with
accompanying motor weakness with (familial) or without (sporadic) history in a first- or
second-degree relative. Sporadic cases always
require neuroimaging.
5. Retinal migraine: Fully reversible monocular visual phenomenon (e.g., scintillations, scotoma, blindness) accompanied
by headache fulfilling migraine definition.

LWBK1000-C10_p242-292.indd 290

Appropriate investigations to exclude other
causes of transient monocular blindness
should be completed.
6. Basilar-type migraine: Aura symptoms
mimic vertebrobasilar artery insufficiency
in a patient with migraine. See 10.23, Vertebrobasilar Artery Insufficiency.
7. Ophthalmoplegic migraine: Onset in childhood. May develop a third cranial nerve
palsy.

Associations or Precipitating Factors
Birth control or other hormonal pills, puberty,
pregnancy, menopause, foods containing
tyramine or phenylalanine (e.g., aged cheeses,
wines, chocolate, cashew nuts), nitrates or
nitrites, monosodium glutamate, alcohol,
fatigue, emotional stress, or bright lights.

Work-Up
See 10.26, Headache, for a general headache
work-up.
1. History: May establish the diagnosis.
2. Ocular and neurologic examinations, including refraction.
3. CT scan or MRI of the head is indicated for:
—Atypical migraines: Migraines that are
always on the same side of the head, those
with an unusual sequence, such as visual
disturbances persisting into or occurring
after the headache phase.
—Complicated migraines.
4. Consider checking for uncontrolled blood
pressure or low blood sugar (hypoglycemic
headaches are almost always precipitated
by stress or fatigue).

Treatment
1. Avoid agents that precipitate the headaches
(e.g., stop using birth control pills; avoid
alcohol and any foods that may precipitate
attacks; reduce stress).
2. Referral to neurologist or internist for pharmacologic management.
a. Abortive therapy: Medications used at
onset of the headache. Best for infrequent headaches.

23/12/11 1:55 AM

10.28

i. Initial therapy: Aspirin or nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents.
ii. More potent therapy (when initial
therapy fails): ergotamines or selective
serotonin receptor agonists (triptans).
Check contraindications for specific
agents.
NOTE: Opioid drugs should be avoided.

b. Prophylactic therapy: Used in patients
with frequent or severe headache attacks
(e.g., two or more headaches per month)

10.28

•

Cluster Headache

or those with neurologic changes.
Includes beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, antidepressants, and others. Check contraindications for specific
medications.
3. Antinausea medication as needed for an
acute episode (e.g., prochlorperazine 25 mg
rectally b.i.d.).

Follow-Up
Reevaluate in 4 to 6 weeks to assess the efficacy of the therapy.

CLUSTER HEADACHE

Symptoms

Work-Up

Typically unilateral, very painful (stabbing),
periorbital, frontal, or temporal headache
associated with ipsilateral tearing, rhinorrhea,
sweating, nasal stuffiness, and/or a droopy
eyelid. Usually lasts for minutes to hours.
Typically recurs once or twice daily for several
weeks, followed by a headache-free interval of
months to years. The cycle may repeat. Predominantly affects men. Headache awakens
patients, whereas migraine does not.

1. History and complete ocular examination.

Signs

Treatment

Ipsilateral conjunctival injection, facial flush,
or Horner syndrome (third-order neuron etiology) may be present. Ptosis may become permanent.

1. No treatment is necessary if the headache is
mild.

Precipitating Factors

2. Neurologic examination, particularly a cranial nerve evaluation.
3. If Horner syndrome present, consider imaging studies to eliminate other causes. See
10.2, Horner Syndrome.
4. Obtain an MRI of the brain when the history is atypical or a neurologic abnormality
is present.

2. Avoid alcoholic beverages or cigarette smoking during a cluster cycle.

Alcohol, nitroglycerin.

3. Refer patient to neurologist to help coordinate pharmacologic therapy.

Differential Diagnosis

4. Abortive therapy for acute attack:

 Migraine headache: Typically unilateral

headache possibly associated with visual
and neurologic symptoms. See 10.27,
Migraine.
 Chronic paroxysmal hemicrania: Several

attacks per day with a dramatic response to
oral indomethacin.
 Others: See 10.26, Headache.

LWBK1000-C10_p242-292.indd 291

10

—Oxygen, 5 to 8 L/min by face mask for
10 minutes at onset of attack. Relieves pain
in 70% of adults.
—Sumatriptan used subcutaneously (6 mg)
or intranasally (20 mg) is often effective in
relieving pain.
—Zolmitriptan 5 or 10 mg intranasally also
appears to be effective.

Neuro-Ophthalmology

—Less frequent medications used include
ergotamine inhalation, dihydroergotamine, or corticosteroids.
5. When headaches are moderate to severe
and are unrelieved by nonprescription
medication, one of the following drugs
may be an effective prophylactic agent during cluster periods:
—Calcium channel blockers (e.g., verapamil
360 to 480 mg/day p.o. in divided doses).
—Lithium 600 to 900 mg p.o. q.d. is administered in conjunction with the patient's
medical doctor. Baseline renal (blood urea
nitrogen, creatinine, urine electrolytes) and
thyroid function tests (triiodothyronine,
thyroxine, TSH) are obtained. Lithium
intoxication may occur in patients using
indomethacin, tetracycline, or methyldopa.
—Ergotamine 1 to 2 mg p.o. q.d.
—Methysergide 2 mg p.o. b.i.d. with meals.
Do not use for longer than 3 to 4 months

because of the significant risk of retroperitoneal fibrosis. Methysergide is not recommended in patients with coronary artery or
peripheral vascular disease, thrombophlebitis, hypertension, pregnancy, or hepatic
or renal disease.
—Oral steroids (e.g., prednisone 40 to
80 mg p.o. for 1 week, tapering rapidly
over an additional week if possible) and an
antiulcer agent (e.g., ranitidine 150 mg p.o.
b.i.d. or pantoprazole 40 mg p.o. q. d.).
6. If necessary, an acute, severe attack can be
treated with intravenous diazepam.

Follow-Up
1. Patients started on systemic steroids are
seen within a few days and then every several weeks to evaluate the effects of treatment and monitor intraocular pressure.
2. Patients taking methysergide or lithium are
reevaluated in 7 to 10 days. Plasma lithium
levels are monitored in patients taking this
agent.

POSTERIOR VITREOUS DETACHMENT

Symptoms
Floaters (“cobwebs,” “bugs,” or “spots” that
change position with eye movement), blurred
vision, flashes of light, which are more common in dim illumination and the temporal
visual field.

Signs
Critical. One or more discrete light gray
to black vitreous opacities, one often in the
shape of a ring (“Weiss ring”) or broken ring,
suspended over the optic disc (see Figure
11.1.1).
Other. Retinal break, retinal detachment
(RD), or vitreous hemorrhage (VH) may occur
with or without a posterior vitreous detachment (PVD), with similar symptoms. Peripheral retinal and disc margin hemorrhages,

released retinal pigment epithelial cells in the
anterior vitreous (“tobacco dust” or Shafer sign).
NOTE: Approximately 8% to 10% of all patients
with acute symptomatic PVD have a retinal break.
The presence of pigmented cells in the anterior vitreous or VH in association with an acute PVD indicates a high probability (>70%) of a coexisting retinal break. See 11.2, Retinal Break.

Differential Diagnosis
 Vitritis: It may be difficult to distinguish

PVD with anterior vitreous pigmented cells
from inflammatory cells. In vitritis, vitreous cells may be found in both the posterior and anterior vitreous, the condition
may be bilateral, and the cells are not typically pigmented. See 12.3, Posterior Uveitis.
 Migraine: Multicolored photopsias in a

zig-zag pattern that obstructs vision, lasts
approximately 20 minutes. A headache
may or may not follow. Normal fundus
examination. See 10.27, Migraine.

Work-Up
1. History: Distinguish retinal photopsias from
the visual distortion of migraine, which may
be accompanied by new floaters. Duration of
the symptoms? Risk factors for retinal break
(previous intraocular surgery, high myopia,
family history of retinal tears, and/or detachments)?

with indirect ophthalmoscopy and scleral
depression to rule out a retinal break and
detachment.
3. Visualize the PVD at the slit lamp with a
60- or 90-diopter lens by identifying a grayto-black strand suspended in the vitreous.
If not visible, have the patient look up,
down, and then straight to float the PVD
into view.
4. If a VH obscures visualization of the retina,
ultrasonography (US) is indicated to identify the PVD and rule out a RD, tumor, or
hemorrhagic macular degeneration. Occasionally, the flap of a tear can be identified.
See 11.13, Vitreous Hemorrhage.

Treatment
No treatment is indicated for PVD. If an acute
retinal break is found, see 11.2, Retinal Break.
NOTE: A retinal break surrounded by pigment is old
and usually does not require treatment.

11.2

Acute retinal break: Flashes of light, floaters
(“cobwebs” or “spots” that change position
with eye movement), and sometimes blurred
vision. Can be identical to symptoms associated with PVD.
Chronic retinal breaks or atrophic retinal
holes: Usually asymptomatic.

Signs
(See Figure 11.2.1.)
Critical. A full-thickness retinal defect, usually seen in the periphery.
Other. Acute retinal break: Pigmented cells
in the anterior vitreous, VH, PVD, retinal flap,
subretinal fluid (SRF), or an operculum (a freefloating piece of retina) suspended in the vitreous cavity above the retinal hole.

 The patient should be given a list of RD

symptoms (an increase in floaters or flashing
lights, worsening vision, or the appearance
of a persistent curtain or shadow anywhere
in the field of vision) and told to return
immediately if these symptoms develop.
 If

no retinal break or hemorrhage is
found, the patient should be scheduled for
repeated examination with scleral depression in 2 to 4 weeks, 2 to 3 months, and
6 months after the symptoms first develop.

 If no retinal break is found, but mild VH

or peripheral punctate retinal hemorrhages
are present, repeated examinations are performed 1 week, 2 to 4 weeks, 3 months, and
6 months after the event.
 If no retinal break is found but significant VH

or anterior pigmented vitreous cells are present, repeat examination should be performed
the next day by a retina specialist because of
the high likelihood of a retinal break.

Follow-Up

Chronic retinal break: A surrounding ring of
pigmentation, a demarcation line between
attached and detached retina, and signs (but
no symptoms) of an acute retinal break.

Predisposing Conditions
Lattice degeneration, high myopia, aphakia,
pseudophakia, age-related retinoschisis, vitreoretinal tufts, meridional folds, history of
previous retinal break or detachment in the
fellow eye, family history of retinal break or
detachment, and trauma.

Differential Diagnosis
 Meridional fold: Small radial fold of retina

perpendicular to the ora serrata and overlying an oral tooth; may have small retinal
hole at the base.
 Meridional complex: Meridional fold that

extends to a ciliary process.

retinal breaks, and only rarely for chronic
breaks. Each case must be individualized;
however, we follow these general guidelines:
1. Treatment recommended
—Acute symptomatic break (e.g., a horseshoe or operculated tear).
—Acute traumatic break (including a dialysis).
2. Treatment to be considered
—Asymptomatic retinal break that is large
(e.g., ≥1.5 mm), above the horizontal meridian, or both, particularly if there is no PVD.

 Vitreoretinal tuft: Focal area of vitreous

traction causing elevation of the retina.

—Asymptomatic retinal break in an aphakic or pseudophakic eye, an eye in which
the involved or the contralateral eye has
had an RD, or in a highly myopic eye.

 Paving stone degeneration.

Follow-Up

 Lattice degeneration.

1. Patients with predisposing conditions or
retinal breaks that do not require treatment
are followed every 6 to 12 months.

Work-Up
Complete ocular examination with a slit-lamp
and indirect ophthalmoscopy of both eyes
with scleral depression. Scleral depression is
deferred until 2 to 4 weeks after a traumatic
hyphema or microhyphema.

Treatment
In general, laser therapy or cryotherapy is
required within 24 to 72 hours for acute

2. Patients treated for a retinal break are reexamined in 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, and
then every 6 to 12 months.
3. RD symptoms (an increase in floaters or
flashing lights, the appearance of a curtain,
shadow, worsening vision, or a bubble anywhere in the field of vision) are explained
and patients are told to return immediately
if these symptoms develop.

11.3

RETINAL DETACHMENT

There are three distinct types of RD. All three
forms show an elevation of the retina.

RHEGMATOGENOUS RETINAL DETACHMENT
Symptoms
Flashes of light, floaters, a curtain, or shadow
moving over the field of vision, peripheral or
central visual loss, or both.

Signs
(See Figures 11.3.1 to 11.3.3.)

LWBK1000-C11_p293-357.indd 295

Critical. Elevation of the retina from the retinal
pigment epithelium (RPE) by fluid in the subretinal space due to an accompanying full-thickness
retinal break or breaks. See 11.2, Retinal Break.
Other. Anterior vitreous pigmented cells, VH,
PVD, usually lower intraocular pressure (IOP) in
the affected eye, nonshifting clear SRF, sometimes fixed retinal folds. The detached retina
is often corrugated and partially opaque in
appearance. A mild relative afferent pupillary
defect (RAPD) may be present.

FIGURE 11.3.3. B-scan US of retinal detachment.
FIGURE 11.3.1. Rhegmatogenous retinal detachment.

NOTE: A chronic rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD) often shows a pigmented demarcation
line at the posterior extent of the RD, intraretinal
cysts, fixed folds, white dots underneath the retina
(subretinal precipitates), or a combination of these
with a relative visual field defect. It should be differentiated from retinoschisis, which produces an absolute visual field defect.

2. B-scan US may be helpful if media opacities
are present.

EXUDATIVE RETINAL DETACHMENT
Symptoms
Minimal to severe visual loss or a visual field
defect; visual changes may vary with changes
in head position.

Signs
Etiology
A retinal break allows fluid to move through
the hole and separate the overlying retina
from the RPE.

Work-Up

11

1. Indirect ophthalmoscopy with scleral depression. Slit-lamp examination with contact lens may help in finding small breaks.

FIGURE 11.3.2. Retinal detachment with retinal
break in lattice degeneration.

LWBK1000-C11_p293-357.indd 296

(See Figure 11.3.4.)
Critical. Serous elevation of the retina with
shifting SRF. The area of detached retina
changes when the patient changes position:
While sitting, the SRF accumulates inferiorly,
detaching the inferior retina; while in the
supine position, the fluid accumulates in the
posterior pole, detaching the macula. There is
no retinal break; fluid accumulation is due to

FIGURE 11.3.4.

breakdown of the normal inner or outer
blood-retinal barrier. The detachment does
not extend to the ora serrata.
Other. The detached retina is smooth and
may become quite bullous. A mild RAPD may
be present if posterior pole involved.

Etiology
 Neoplastic:

Choroidal malignant melanoma, metastasis, choroidal hemangioma,
multiple myeloma, retinal capillary hemangioma (hemangioblastoma), etc.

 Inflammatory

disease: Vogt–Koyanagi–
Harada (VKH) syndrome, posterior scleritis, sympathetic ophthalmia, other chronic
inflammatory processes.

4. Systemic work-up to rule out the above
causes (e.g., HTN, multiple myeloma, etc.).

TRACTIONAL RETINAL DETACHMENT
Symptoms
Visual loss or visual field defect; may be
asymptomatic.

Signs
(See Figure 11.3.5.)
Critical. The detached retina appears concave
with a smooth surface; cellular and vitreous
membranes exerting traction on the retina are
present; retinal striae extending from these areas
may also be seen. Detachment may become a
convex RRD if a tractional retinal tear develops.

abnormalities: Optic pit,
morning-glory syndrome, and choroidal
coloboma (although these may have an
associated retinal break).

Other. The retina is immobile, and the detachment rarely extends to the ora serrata. A mild
RAPD may be present.

 Vascular: Choroidal neovascularization (CNV),

Fibrocellular bands in the vitreous (e.g., resulting
from proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR),
sickle cell retinopathy, retinopathy of prematurity, FEVR, toxocariasis, trauma, previous giant
retinal tear) contract and detach the retina.

 Congenital

Coats disease, malignant hypertension (HTN),
preeclampsia, and familial exudative vitreoretinopathy (FEVR). See specific sections.
 Nanophthalmos: Small eyes with a small

cornea and a shallow anterior chamber but
a large lens and a thick sclera.
 Idiopathic central serous chorioretinopathy

(CSCR): May be seen with bullous RD from
multiple, large RPE detachments. See 11.15,
Central Serous Chorioretinopathy.
 Uveal effusion syndrome: Bilateral detach-

ments of the peripheral choroid, ciliary
body, and retina; leopard-spot RPE changes
(when retina is reattached); cells in the vitreous; dilated episcleral vessels; more common in patients with high hyperopia, particularly nanophthalmic eyes.

Etiology

Work-Up
1. Indirect ophthalmoscopy with scleral
depression. Slit-lamp examination with contact lens may help in finding small breaks.
2. B-scan US may be helpful if media opacities
are present.
3. OCT is useful in identifying tractional membranes and can be useful in differentiating
tractional membranes from detached retina.

11

Work-Up
1. Intravenous fluorescein angiography (IVFA)
may show source of SRF.
2. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) may
help identify SRF as well as the source (e.g.,
CNV).
3. B-scan US may help delineate the underlying cause.

Retina

Differential Diagnosis for All Three Types of
Retinal Detachment
 Acquired/age-related degenerative retinos-

chisis: Commonly bilateral, usually inferotemporal, no pigmented cells or hemorrhage are present in the vitreous, the retinal
vessels in the inner retinal layers are often
sheathed peripherally, and white “snowflakes” are often seen on the inner retinal
layers. See 11.4, Retinoschisis.
 X-linked retinoschisis: Petaloid foveal changes

are present over 90% of the time. Dehiscences
occur in the nerve fiber layer (NFL) 50% of the
time. See 11.4, Retinoschisis.
 Choroidal detachment: Orange–brown, more

solid in appearance than an RD, often extends
360 degrees. Hypotony is usually present.
See 11.27, Choroidal Effusion/Detachment.

Treatment
1. Patients with an acute RRD that threatens
the fovea should be placed on bed rest,

11.4

2. All RRDs that are macula-off, or tractional
retinal detachments that involve the
macula, are repaired preferably within a
few days. Visual outcomes for macula-off
detachments do not change if surgery is
performed within 7–10 days of the onset.
3. Chronic RDs are treated within 1 week if
possible.
4. For exudative RD, successful treatment of
the underlying condition often leads to
resolution of the detachment.

Follow-Up
Patients treated for RD are reexamined at
1 day, 1 week, 2 weeks, 1 month, 2 to 3
months, then every 6 to 12 months.

RETINOSCHISIS

Retinoschisis, a splitting of the retina, occurs
in X-linked (juvenile) and age-related degenerative forms.

11

with surgical repair performed urgently.
The visual prognosis is significantly worse
in detachments that progress to involve the
fovea. Surgical options include laser photocoagulation, cryotherapy, pneumatic retinopexy, vitrectomy, and scleral buckle.

X-LINKED (JUVENILE) RETINOSCHISIS
Symptoms

leak on IVFA, but can be seen with indocyanine green (ICG) and on OCT. The macular
appearance changes in adulthood and the petaloid pattern may disappear.
Other. Separation of the nerve fiber layer

Decreased vision due to VH (25%) and macular changes, or asymptomatic. The condition
is congenital, but may not be detected at birth
if an examination is not performed. A family
history may or may not be elicited (X-linked
recessive).

Signs
(See Figure 11.4.1.)
Critical. Foveal schisis seen as stellate maculopathy: Cystoid foveal changes with retinal
folds that radiate from the center of the fovea
(petaloid pattern). Unlike the cysts of cystoid
macular edema (CME), they do not stain or

quadrant, most commonly) with the development of NFL breaks; this peripheral retinoschisis occurs in 50% of patients. However, schisis
may occur between any two retinal layers. RD,
VH, and pigmentary changes also may occur.
Pigmented demarcation lines may be seen
(indicating previous RD) even though the retina is not detached at the time, unlike acquired
age-related degenerative retinoschisis.

Differential Diagnosis
 Age-related degenerative retinoschisis (see

below).
 RRD: Usually unilateral, acquired, and asso-

ciated with a retinal tear. Pigment in the
anterior vitreous is seen. See 11.3, Retinal
Detachment.

•

Retinoschisis

299

Signs
Critical. The schisis cavity is dome-shaped
with a smooth surface and is usually located
temporally, especially inferotemporally. Usually bilateral and may show sheathing of
retinal vessels and “snowflakes” or “frosting” (persistent Mueller fibers) on the elevated inner wall of the schisis cavity. Unlike
X-linked juvenile retinoschisis, splitting usually occurs at the level of the outer plexiform
layer. The area of schisis is not mobile, and
there is no associated RPE pigmentation.
Other. Prominent cystoid degeneration near
the ora serrata, an absolute scotoma corresponding to the area of schisis, hyperopia is
common, no pigment cells or hemorrhage in
the vitreous, and absence of a demarcation
line. An RRD may occasionally develop.

Work-Up
1. Family history.

Differential Diagnosis

2. Dilated retinal examination with scleral
depression to rule out a retinal break or
detachment.

 RRD: Surface is corrugated in appearance

3. OCT can help determine the layer of the
schisis and help to differentiate schisis from
an RD.

Treatment
1. No treatment for stellate maculopathy.
2. For non-clearing VH, consider vitrectomy.
3. Surgical repair of an RD should be performed.
4. Superimposed amblyopia may be present
in children younger than 11 years of age
when one eye is more severely affected and
a trial of patching should be considered.
See 8.7, Amblyopia.

Follow-Up
Every 6 months; sooner if treating amblyopia.

AGE-RELATED DEGENERATIVE
RETINOSCHISIS

and moves more with eye movements. A
long-standing RD may resemble retinoschisis, but intraretinal cysts, demarcation lines
between attached and detached retina, and
white sub-retinal dots may be seen. Only a
relative scotoma is present. See 11.3, Retinal
Detachment.
 X-linked

juvenile

retinoschisis

(see

above).

Work-Up
1. Slit-lamp evaluation for anterior chamber
inflammation and pigmented anterior vitreous cells; neither should be present in
isolated retinoschisis.
2. Dilated retinal examination with scleral
depression to rule out a concomitant RD or
an outer layer retinal hole, which may lead
to an RD.
3. A fundus contact lens evaluation of the
retina as needed to aid in recognizing outer
layer retinal breaks.

Symptoms

4. OCT can help determine which layer of the
retina is split.

Usually asymptomatic; may have decreased
vision.

5. Visual field testing will reveal an absolute
scotoma in the area of schisis.

Treatment

Follow-Up

1. Surgery is indicated when a clinically significant RD develops.

Every 6 months. RD symptoms (an increase
in floaters or flashing lights, blurry vision, or
the appearance of a curtain or shadow anywhere in the field of vision) are explained to
all patients, and patients are told to return
immediately if these symptoms develop.

2. A small RD walled off by a demarcation line
is usually not treated. This may take the
form of pigmentation at the posterior border of outer layer breaks.

have vitritis and retinal hemorrhages associated with them. See 12.5, Toxoplasmosis, and
12.8, Acute Retinal Necrosis.
 Myelinated

NFL: Develops postnatally.
Usually peripapillary but may be in retinal areas remote from the disc (see Figure
11.5.2).

Etiology
Thought to be an acute obstruction of a precapillary retinal arteriole causing blockage of
axoplasmic flow and buildup of axoplasmic
debris in the NFL.

in chronic HTN. Acute HTN may have
hard exudates, optic nerve swelling,
exudative RD. See 11.10, Hypertensive
Retinopathy.
 Retinal vein occlusion: Unilateral, mul-

tiple hemorrhages, venous dilation, and
tortuosity. Multiple CWS, usually ≥6, seen
in ischemic varieties. See 11.8, Central Retinal Vein Occlusion, and 11.9, Branch Retinal
Vein Occlusion.
 Retinal emboli: Often from carotid arteries

or heart with resulting ischemia and subsequent CWS distal to arterial occlusion.
Patients require carotid Doppler examination and echocardiography. See 10.22,
Transient Visual Loss/Amaurosis Fugax.
 Collagen vascular disease: Systemic lupus

erythematosus (most common), Wegener
granulomatosis, polyarteritis nodosa, scleroderma, etc.
 Giant cell arteritis (GCA): Age ≥55 years.

Symptoms include vision loss, scalp tenderness, jaw claudication, proximal muscle
aches, etc. See 10.17, Arteritic Ischemic Optic
Neuropathy (Giant Cell Arteritis).
 HIV retinopathy: Single or multiple cotton-

wool spots in the posterior pole. See 12.10,
Noninfectious Retinal Microvasculopathy/HIV
Retinopathy.
 Other infections: Toxoplasmosis, orbital

mucormycosis, Lyme, leptospirosis, Rocky
Mountain spotted fever, onchocerciasis,
subacute bacterial endocarditis.

tiple myeloma, cryoglobulinemia, Waldenström macroglobulinemia, antiphospholipid syndrome, factor V Leiden, activated
protein C resistance, hyperhomocysteinemia, protein C and S deficiency, antithrombin III mutation, prothrombin mutation G20210A, etc.
 Radiation retinopathy: Follows radiation

therapy to the eye or periocular structures when the eye is irradiated inadvertently. May occur any time after radiation, but occurs most commonly within

a few years. Maintain a high suspicion
even in patients in whom the eye was
reportedly shielded. Usually, 3,000 cGy
is necessary, but it has been noted to
occur with 1,500 cGy. Resembles diabetic
retinopathy.
 Interferon therapy.
 Purtscher and pseudo-Purtscher retinopa-

thy: Multiple cotton-wool spots and/or
superficial hemorrhages in a peripapillary
configuration. Typically bilateral but can
be unilateral and asymmetric. See 3.19,
Purtscher Retinopathy.
 Cancer: Metastatic carcinoma, leukemia,

lymphoma.
 Others: Migraine, hypotension, intrave-

nous drug use, papilledema, papillitis,
severe anemia, sickle cell, acute blood loss,
etc.

Work-Up
1. History: Diabetes or HTN? Ocular or periocular radiation in past? GCA symptoms
in appropriate age group? Symptoms of
collagen vascular disease including joint
pain, rashes, etc.? HIV risk factors?
2. Complete ocular examination, including dilated retinal examination with a slit
lamp and a 60- or 90-diopter lens and indirect ophthalmoscopy. Look for concurrent
hemorrhages, vascular occlusion, vasculitis,
hard exudates.

11

3. Check a fasting blood sugar.
4. Check the blood pressure.
5. Consider erythrocyte sedimentation rate
(ESR), c-reactive protein (CRP), and platelets if GCA is suspected.
6. Consider blood and urine cultures, chest
x-ray, carotid Doppler examination,
and echocardiography if emboli are suspected.
7. Consider HIV testing.

Depends on the underlying etiology. CWS
typically fade in 5 to 7 weeks but can remain
longer if associated with diabetic retinopathy.

CENTRAL RETINAL ARTERY OCCLUSION

Symptoms
Unilateral, painless, acute vision loss (counting fingers to light perception in 94% of eyes)
occurring over seconds; may have a history of
transient visual loss (amaurosis fugax).

Signs
(See Figure 11.6.1.)
Critical. Superficial opacification or whitening of the retina in the posterior pole, and
a cherry-red spot in the center of the macula
(may be subtle).
Other. Marked RAPD; narrowed retinal
arterioles; boxcarring or segmentation of the
blood column in the arterioles. Occasionally,
retinal arteriolar emboli or cilioretinal artery
sparing of the foveola is evident. If visual acuity is light perception or worse, strongly suspect ophthalmic artery occlusion.

Differential Diagnosis
 Acute ophthalmic artery occlusion: Usually

11

Follow-Up

no cherry-red spot; the entire retina appears
whitened. The treatment is the same as for
central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO).

 Commotio retinae: Retinal whitening from

intracellular edema and fragmentation of
the photoreceptor outer segments and RPE.
Follows blunt trauma, resolves spontaneously. May mimic a cherry-red spot when
the posterior pole is involved. See 3.16, Commotio Retinae.
 Other causes of a cherry-red spot: Tay–Sachs,

Niemann–Pick disease type A, etc. These
conditions present early in life with other,
often severe, systemic manifestations. Ophthalmic findings are usually bilateral.

Etiology
 Embolus: Three main types include choles-

terol, calcium, and platelet-fibrin emboli. All
are seen within a vessel. Cholesterol emboli
(Hollenhorst plaque) are typically refractile,
orange, and seen at retinal vessel bifurcations. They arise from ulcerated atheromas,
typically from the carotid arteries. Calcium
emboli are white and frequently cause distal
retinal infarction. They typically arise from
cardiac valves. Platelet-fibrin emboli are a
dull white and typically arise from atheromas in the carotid arteries.
 Thrombosis.
 GCA: May produce CRAO, ophthalmic

artery occlusion, or an ischemic optic neuropathy. See 10.17, Arteritic Ischemic Optic
Neuropathy (Giant Cell Arteritis).

disease, mitral valve prolapse, recent myocardial infarction, prosthetic valve, intravenous drug abuse,
congenital heart disease, valvular heart disease,
any detectable heart murmur, and ECG changes
(atrial fibrillation, acute ST segment elevation, or
Q waves).

Work-Up
1. Immediate ESR, CRP, and platelets to rule
out GCA if the patient is 55 years of age
or older. If the patient’s history, laboratories, or both are consistent with GCA, start
high-dose systemic steroids. See 10.17,
Arteritic Ischemic Optic Neuropathy (Giant
Cell Arteritis).
2. Check the blood pressure.
3. Other blood tests: Fasting blood sugar, glycosylated hemoglobin, complete blood count
(CBC) with differential, prothrombin time/
activated partial thromboplastin time (PT/
PTT). In patients younger than 50 years or
with appropriate risk factors or positive review
of systems, consider lipid profile, antinuclear
antibody (ANA), rheumatoid factor, fluorescent treponemal antibody absorbed (FTAABS), serum protein electrophoresis, hemoglobin electrophoresis, and further evaluation
for hypercoagulable state (see above).
4. Carotid artery evaluation by duplex Doppler US.
5. Cardiac evaluation with electrocardiography (ECG), echocardiography, and possibly
Holter monitoring.
6. Consider IVFA, electroretinography (ERG),
or both to confirm the diagnosis.
NOTE: It has been suggested that only patients
with high-risk characteristics for cardioembolic disease merit echocardiography, including a history
of subacute bacterial endocarditis, rheumatic heart

Treatment
There are anecdotal reports of improvement
after the following treatments, if instituted
within 90 to 120 minutes of the occlusive
event. None of these treatments have been
proven effective in randomized, controlled
clinical trials, and should not be considered
the standard of care.
1. Immediate ocular massage with fundus
contact lens or digital massage.
2. Anterior chamber paracentesis: See Appendix 13, Anterior Chamber Paracentesis.
3. IOP reduction with acetazolamide, 500 mg
i.v., or two 250-mg tablets p.o. or a topical
beta-blocker (e.g., timolol or levobunolol,
0.5% b.i.d.).
4. Hyperventilation into a paper bag to induce
a respiratory acidosis and subsequent vasodilation.

Follow-Up
1. Refer to an internist for a complete work-up
as above.
2. Repeat eye examination in 1 to 4 weeks,
checking for neovascularization of the
iris/disc/angle/retina (NVI/NVD/NVA/NVE),
which develops in up to 20% of patients,
at a mean of 4 weeks after onset. If neovascularization develops, perform panretinal
photocoagulation (PRP) and/or administer
an anti-vascular endothelial growth factor
(anti-VEGF) agent.

Unlike in CRAO, an ERG is not helpful.
NOTE: When a branch retinal artery occlusion (BRAO)
is accompanied by optic nerve edema or retinitis,
obtain appropriate serologic testing to rule out catscratch disease [Bartonella (Rochalimaea) henselae],
syphilis, Lyme disease, and toxoplasmosis.

artery. The affected retina becomes edematous.

1. No ocular therapy of proven value is available. See treatment in 11.6, Central Retinal
Artery Occlusion.
2. Treat any underlying medical problem.

Follow-Up
Other. Narrowed branch retinal artery; boxcarring, segmentation of the blood column,
or emboli are sometimes seen in the affected
branch retinal artery. Cholesterol emboli
appear as bright, reflective crystals, usually at
a vessel bifurcation. Cotton-wool spots may
appear in the involved area.

1. Patients need immediate evaluation to treat
any underlying disorders (especially GCA).
2. Reevaluate every 3 to 6 months initially to
monitor progression. Ocular neovascularization after branch retinal artery occlusion
is rare.

CENTRAL RETINAL VEIN OCCLUSION

Symptoms

11

Painless loss of vision, usually unilateral.

Signs
(See Figure 11.8.1.)
Critical. Diffuse retinal hemorrhages in all
four quadrants of the retina; dilated, tortuous
retinal veins.
Other. Cotton-wool spots; disc edema and
hemorrhages; macular edema; optociliary collateral vessels on the disc; neovascularization
of the optic disc (NVD), retina (NVE), iris
(NVI), and angle (NVA).

Differential Diagnosis
 Ocular ischemic syndrome (OIS) or carotid

occlusive disease: Dilated and irregular veins
without tortuosity. Mid-peripheral retinal

hemorrhages are typically present, but disc
edema and hemorrhages are not characteristic. Disc neovascularization is present
in one-third of cases. Patients may have a
history of transient visual loss (amaurosis
fugax), transient ischemic attacks, or orbital
pain. See 11.11, Ocular Ischemic Syndrome/
Carotid Occlusive Disease.
 Diabetic retinopathy: Hemorrhages and

microaneurysms concentrated in the posterior pole. Typically bilateral. IVFA differentiates this condition from CRVO. See 11.12,
Diabetic Retinopathy.
 Papilledema: Bilateral disc swelling with

flame-shaped hemorrhages surrounding
the disc. See 10.15, Papilledema.
 Radiation retinopathy: History of irradiation.

Disc swelling with radiation papillopathy,
and retinal neovascularization may be present. Generally, cotton-wool spots are a more
prominent feature than hemorrhages.

Etiology
 Atherosclerosis of the adjacent central reti-

nal artery: The artery compresses the central retinal vein in the region of the lamina
cribrosa, secondarily inducing thrombosis
in the lumen of the vein.
 HTN: Most common systemic disease asso-

ciated with CRVO.
 Optic disc edema.
 Glaucoma: Most common ocular disease

associated with CRVO.
 Optic disc drusen.
 Hypercoagulable state: Polycythemia, mul-

tiple myeloma, cryoglobulinemia, Waldenström macroglobulinemia, antiphospholipid syndrome, factor V Leiden, activated
protein C resistance, hyperhomocysteinemia, protein C and S deficiency, antithrombin III mutation, prothrombin mutation
G20210A, and others.
 Vasculitis: Sarcoidosis, syphilis, systemic

lupus erythematosus, and others.
 Drugs: Oral contraceptives, diuretics, and

others.
 Abnormal platelet function.

 Orbital disease: Thyroid eye disease, orbital

tumors, arteriovenous fistula, and others.
 Migraine: Rare.

Types
 Ischemic CRVO: Multiple cotton-wool spots

(usually ≥6), extensive retinal hemorrhage,
and widespread capillary nonperfusion on
IVFA. RAPD often present and visual acuity
is typically 20/400 or worse with visual field
constriction. ERG shows decreased b-wave
amplitude.
 Nonischemic CRVO: Mild fundus changes.

No RAPD is present and acuity is often better than 20/400.

Work-Up
Ocular
1. Complete ocular examination, including
IOP measurement, careful slit-lamp examination and gonioscopy to rule out NVI and
NVA (both of which are best observed before
dilation), and dilated fundus examination.
2. IVFA: Risk of neovascularization proportional to degree of capillary nonperfusion.
3. Optical Coherence Tomography: Used to help
detect presence and extent of macular edema
as well as to monitor response to therapy.
4. If the diagnosis is uncertain, oculopneumoplethysmography or ophthalmodynamometry may help to distinguish CRVO from
carotid disease. Ophthalmic artery pressure
is low in carotid disease but is normal to
increased in CRVO.

11

Systemic
1. History: Medical problems, medications,
eye diseases?
2. Check blood pressure.
3. Blood tests: Fasting blood sugar, glycosylated hemoglobin, CBC with differential,
platelets, PT/PTT, ESR, lipid profile.
4. If clinically indicated, particularly in
younger patients, consider hemoglobin
electrophoresis, VDRL or RPR, FTA-ABS,
ANA, cryoglobulins, antiphospholipid antibodies, factor V Leiden mutation, protein
C and S levels, antithrombin III mutation,

Retina

prothrombin G20210A mutation, homocysteine levels, serum protein electrophoresis, and chest radiograph.
5. Complete medical evaluation, with careful
attention to cardiovascular disease or
hypercoagulability.

Treatment
1. Discontinue oral contraceptives; change
diuretics to other antihypertensive medications if possible.
2. Reduce IOP if increased in either eye. See
9.1, Primary Open-Angle Glaucoma.
3. Treat underlying medical disorders.
4. If NVI or NVA is present, perform PRP
promptly. Consider PRP if NVD or retinal
neovascularization is present. Prophylactic
PRP is usually not recommended unless follow-up is in doubt. Intravitreal VEGF inhibitors are very effective in temporarily halting
or reversing anterior and posterior segment
neovascularization. They may be a useful adjunct to PRP, particularly when rapid
reversal of neovascularization is needed.

vision and reducing vision loss in patients
with ME secondary to CRVO
NOTE: In a large, prospective, randomized
trial (SCORE CRVO), a 1 mg dose of intravitreal
triamcinolone was found to be equally as effective as a 4 mg dose, but with fewer side-effects
(elevated IOP and cataract formation).

Follow-Up
1. Visual acuity 20/40 or better: Every 1 to 2
months for the first 6 months, with a gradual
interval taper to annual follow-ups.
2. Visual acuity <20/200: Depends on the type
of treatment employed, but in general, every
month for the first 6 months, with a gradual
taper based on the patient’s condition.
3. Undilated gonioscopy looking for NVA,
followed by careful dilated fundus examination looking for NVD or retinal neovascularization, should be performed at each
follow-up visit. Evidence of early NVI or
NVA should prompt immediate PRP and/or
anti-VEGF therapy and monthly follow-up
until stabilized or regressed.

5. Aspirin 81 to 325 mg p.o. q.d. is often
recommended, but no clinical trials have
demonstrated efficacy to date and it may
increase the risk of hemorrhage.

4. Patients should be informed that there is an
8% to 10% risk for the development of a
BRVO or CRVO in the fellow eye.

CRVO-Related Macular Edema
1. Intravitreal ranibizumab 0.5 mg is U.S. Food
and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved for
treating RVO-related macular edema (ME).
Phase III clinical trials have shown promise
for the new intravitreal anti-VEGF agent,
aflibercept, for the treatment of RVO-related
ME. Intravitreal bevacizumab has been used
off-label in a similar fashion. Risks of intravitreal injections are low, but include VH and
endophthalmitis, among others.

BRANCH RETINAL VEIN OCCLUSION

Symptoms

Work-Up

Blind spot in the visual field or loss of vision,
usually unilateral.

1. History: Systemic disease, particularly HTN
or diabetes?

Signs

2. Complete ocular examination, including
dilated retinal examination with indirect
ophthalmoscopy to look for retinal neovascularization, and a macular examination
with a slit lamp and a 60- or 90-diopter lens,
or fundus contact lens to detect ME.

(See Figure 11.9.1.)
Critical. Superficial hemorrhages in a sector
of the retina along a retinal vein. The hemorrhages usually do not cross the horizontal
raphe (midline).
Other. Cotton-wool spots, retinal edema, a
dilated and tortuous retinal vein, narrowing
and sheathing of the adjacent artery, retinal
neovascularization, VH.

cross the horizontal raphe. Bilateral in
most. See 11.10, Hypertensive Retinopathy.

7. An IVFA is obtained after the hemorrhages
clear or sooner if neovascularization is suspected.

Etiology

Treatment

Disease of the adjacent arterial wall (usually the
result of HTN, arteriosclerosis, or diabetes) compresses the venous wall at a crossing point.

1. Retinal neovascularization: Sector PRP to
the ischemic area, which corresponds to
area of capillary nonperfusion on IVFA.

11

2. Prompt and appropriate treatment of underlying medical conditions (e.g., HTN).
BRVO-Related Macular Edema
1. Focal retinal laser photocoagulation is
the traditional gold-standard treatment if
edema is present for 3 to 6 months duration, and visual acuity is below 20/40 with
macular capillary perfusion. Limitations
of focal laser include length of time before
effect (often several months) and the need
to wait until retinal hemorrhages clear.

HTN. See 11.8, Central Retinal Vein Occlusion,
or 11.9, Branch Retinal Vein Occlusion.

2. Check blood pressure.
3. Complete ocular examination, particularly
dilated fundus examination.
4. Refer patient to a medical internist or an emergency department. The urgency depends on
the blood pressure reading and whether the
patient is symptomatic. As a general rule, a
diastolic blood pressure of 110 to 120 mm
Hg or the presence of chest pain, difficulty
breathing, headache, change in mental status, or blurred vision with optic disc swelling
requires immediate medical attention.

Treatment
Control the HTN, as per the internist.

OCULAR ISCHEMIC SYNDROME/CAROTID
OCCLUSIVE DISEASE

Symptoms
Decreased vision, ocular or periorbital pain,
after images or prolonged recovery of vision
after exposure to bright light, may have a history of transient monocular visual loss (amaurosis fugax). Usually unilateral. Typically occurs
in patients who are aged 50 to 80 years. Men
outnumber women by 2:1.

Signs
Critical. Although retinal veins are dilated
and irregular in caliber, they are typically not
tortuous. The retinal arterioles are narrowed.
Associated findings include mid-peripheral
retinal hemorrhages (80%), iris neovascularization (66%), and posterior segment neovascularization (37%).

LWBK1000-C11_p293-357.indd 309

Other. Episcleral injection, corneal edema,
mild anterior uveitis, neovascular glaucoma,
iris atrophy, cataract, retinal microaneurysms,
cotton-wool spots, spontaneous pulsations of
the central retinal artery, and cherry-red spot.
CRAO may occur.

Differential Diagnosis
 CRVO: Similar signs. Decreased vision

after exposure to light and orbital pain
are not typically found. Ophthalmodynamometry may aid differentiating OIS from
CRVO. See 11.8, Central Retinal Vein Occlusion.

Retina

 Aortic arch disease: Caused by atherosclero-

sis, syphilis, or Takayasu arteritis. Produces
a clinical picture identical to OIS, but usually bilateral. Examination reveals absent
arm and neck pulses, cold hands, and
spasm of the arm muscles with exercise.

Etiology
 Carotid disease: Usually ≥90% stenosis.
 Ophthalmic artery disease: Less common.

Work-Up
1. History: Previous episodes of transient
monocular visual loss? Cold hands or
spasm of arm muscles with exercise?
2. Complete ocular examination: Search carefully for neovascularization of the iris, angle,
disc, and retina.
3. Medical examination: Evaluate for HTN,
diabetes, and atherosclerotic disease. Check
pulses. Cardiac and carotid auscultation.
4. Consider IVFA for diagnostic or therapeutic
purposes.
5. Noninvasive carotid artery evaluation:
Duplex Doppler US, oculoplethysmography,
magnetic resonance angiography, others.

11

6. Consider orbital color Doppler US.
7. Consider ophthalmodynamometry if the
diagnosis of CRVO cannot be excluded.
8. Carotid arteriography is reserved for patients
in whom surgery is to be performed.
9. Consider a cardiology consultation, given
the high association with cardiac disease.

Treatment
Often unsuccessful.
1. Carotid endarterectomy for significant stenosis. Refer to neurovascular surgeon.
2. Consider PRP and anti-VEGF agents in the
presence of neovascularization.
3. Manage glaucoma if present. See 9.14, Neovascular Glaucoma.
4. Control HTN, diabetes, and cholesterol.
Refer to internist.
5. Lifestyle modification (e.g., smoking cessation).

Follow-Up
Depends on the age, general health of the
patient, and the symptoms and signs of disease. Surgical candidates should be evaluated
urgently.

Work-Up
1. Slit-lamp examination with gonioscopy
with careful attention for NVI and NVA,
preferably before pharmacologic dilation.
2. Dilated fundus examination by using a 90or 60-diopter or fundus contact lens with
a slit lamp to rule out neovascularization
and ME. Use indirect ophthalmoscopy to
examine the retinal periphery.
3. Fasting blood sugar, glycosylated hemoglobin, and, if necessary, a glucose tolerance
test if the diagnosis is not established.
4. Check the blood pressure.
5. Consider IVFA to determine areas of perfusion abnormalities, foveal ischemia,
microaneurysms, and subclinical neovascularization, especially if considering focal
macular laser therapy.
6. Consider OCT to evaluate for the presence
and extent of ME.
7. Consider blood tests for hyperlipidemia if
extensive exudate is present.

Treatment
Clinically Significant Macular Edema
1. Focal or grid laser treatment should be considered in patients with clinically significant
macular edema. Patients with enlarged foveal
avascular zones on IVFA are treated lightly,
away from the regions of foveal ischemia, if
they are treated at all. Patients with extensive
foveal ischemia are poor laser candidates.
Younger patients and diet-controlled diabetic patients tend to have a better response.
2. Patients with diffuse or extensive ME, isolated sub-foveal edema, ME in the presence of foveal ischemia, or those with poor
response to prior focal/grid laser may benefit from intravitreal anti-VEGF or corticosteroid therapy, either alone or in combination with laser.
Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy
Panretinal laser photocoagulation is indicated
for any one of the following high-risk characteristics (see Figure 11.12.7):
1. NVD greater than one-fourth to one-third
of the disc area in size.
2. Any degree of NVD when associated with
preretinal hemorrhage or VH.
3. NVE greater than one-half of the disc area in
size when associated with a preretinal hemorrhage or VH.
4. Any NVI or neovascularization of the
angle.

11

NOTE: Some physicians treat NVE or any degree of NVD without preretinal hemorrhage or
VH, especially in unreliable patients. If the ocular media is too hazy for an adequate fundus
view, yet one of these criteria is met, anti-VEGF
therapy and/or pars plana vitrectomy and endolaser therapy with or without lensectomy
and posterior chamber intraocular lens implantation are other options. Anti-VEGF therapy
alone must be used cautiously in the presence
of retinal traction.

Indications for Vitrectomy
Vitrectomy may be indicated for any one of
the following conditions:

VITREOUS HEMORRHAGE

Symptoms
Sudden, painless loss of vision or sudden
appearance of black spots, cobwebs, or haze
in the vision.

Signs
(See Figure 11.13.1.)
Critical. In a severe VH, the red fundus reflex
may be absent, and there may be no view to
the fundus. Red blood cells may be seen in
the anterior vitreous. In a mild VH, there may
be a partially obscured view to the fundus.
Chronic VH has a yellow ochre appearance
from hemoglobin breakdown.
Other. A mild RAPD is possible in the setting of dense hemorrhage. Depending on the
etiology, there may be other fundus abnormalities.

Differential Diagnosis
 Vitritis (white blood cells in the vitreous):

Usually not sudden onset; anterior or posterior uveitis may also be present. No red
blood cells are seen in the vitreous. See
12.3, Posterior Uveitis.
 Retinal detachment: May occur without a

VH, but the symptoms may be identical. In
VH due to RD, the peripheral retina is often

11

obscured on indirect ophthalmoscopy. See
11.3, Retinal Detachment.

Etiology
 Diabetic retinopathy: Usually history of

diabetes and usually diabetic retinopathy.
Diabetic retinopathy is usually evident in
the contralateral eye. In VH due to PDR, the
peripheral retina is often visible on indirect
ophthalmoscopy. See 11.12, Diabetic Retinopathy.
 PVD: Common in middle-aged or elderly

patients. Usually patients note floaters and
flashing lights. See 11.1, Posterior Vitreous
Detachment.
 Retinal break: Commonly superior in cases

of dense VH. This may be demonstrated by
scleral depression and, if poor view, B-scan
US. See 11.2, Retinal Break.
 Retinal detachment: May be diagnosed by

B-scan US if the retina cannot be viewed
on clinical examination. See 11.3, Retinal
Detachment.
 Retinal vein occlusion (usually a BRVO):

Commonly occurs in older patients with
a history of high blood pressure. See 11.9,
Branch Retinal Vein Occlusion.
 Exudative Age-Related Macular Degenera-

tion (ARMD): Usually with a disciform scar or
advanced choroidal neovascular membrane.
Poor vision before the VH as a result of their
underlying disease. Macular drusen and/
or other findings of ARMD are found in the
contralateral eye. B-scan US may aid in the
diagnosis. See 11.17, Neovascular or Exudative
(Wet) Age-Related Macular Degeneration.
 Sickle cell disease: May have peripheral reti-

nal neovascularization in the contralateral
eye, typically in a “sea-fan” configuration
and salmon color. See 11.20, Sickle Cell Disease (Including Sickle Cell Anemia, Sickle Trait).
 Trauma: By history.
FIGURE 11.13.1. Vitreous and preretinal hemorrhage due to proliferative diabetic retinopathy.

LWBK1000-C11_p293-357.indd 316

 Intraocular

tumor: May be visible on
ophthalmoscopy or B-scan US. See 5.13,

23/12/11 1:55 AM

11.13

Malignant Melanoma of the Iris, and 11.36,
Choroidal Nevus and Malignant Melanoma of
the Choroid.
 Subarachnoid

or subdural hemorrhage
(Terson syndrome): Frequently bilateral
preretinal or VHs may occur. A severe headache usually precedes the fundus findings.
Coma may occur.

 Eales disease: Usually occurs in men aged 20

to 30 years with peripheral retinal ischemia
and neovascularization of unknown etiology. Decreased vision as a result of VH is frequently the presenting sign. Typically bilateral. Diagnosis of exclusion.
 Others: Ruptured arterial macroaneurysm,

Coats disease, retinopathy of prematurity,
retinal capillary angiomas of von Hippel–
Lindau syndrome, congenital prepapillary
vascular loop, retinal cavernous hemangioma, HTN, radiation retinopathy, anterior
segment hemorrhage because of an intraocular lens, bleeding diathesis, hematologic
malignancy, etc. See specific sections.
NOTE: In infancy and childhood, consider birth
trauma, shaken baby syndrome, child abuse, congenital X-linked retinoschisis, pars planitis, bleeding dyscrasias, and hematologic malignancies.

Work-Up
1. History: Any ocular or systemic diseases,
specifically the ones mentioned previously?
Trauma?
2. Complete ocular examination, including slit-lamp examination with undilated
pupils to check for iris neovascularization,
IOP measurement, and dilated fundus
examination of both eyes by using indirect
ophthalmoscopy. In cases of spontaneous
VH, scleral depression is performed if a retinal view can be obtained.
NOTE: We do not usually depress eyes until
2 weeks after traumatic hyphema/microhyphema.

3. When no retinal view can be obtained,
B-scan US is performed to detect an associ-

LWBK1000-C11_p293-357.indd 317

•

Vitreous Hemorrhage

317

ated RD or intraocular tumor. Flap retinal
tears may be detected with scleral depression and sometimes can be seen on B-scan
US (elevated flap).
4. IVFA may aid in defining the etiology,
although the quality of the angiogram
depends on the density of the hemorrhage.
Additionally, it may be useful to highlight
abnormalities in the contralateral eye.

Treatment
1. If the etiology of the VH is not known and
a retinal break or an RD or both cannot be
ruled out (i.e., there is no known history of
one of the diseases mentioned previously,
there are no changes in the contralateral
eye, and the fundus is obscured by a total
VH), the patient is monitored closely as an
outpatient.
2. Bed rest with the head of the bed elevated
for 2 to 3 days. This reduces the chance of
recurrent bleeding and allows the blood to
settle inferiorly, permitting a view of the
superior peripheral fundus, a common site
for responsible retinal breaks.
3. Eliminate aspirin, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and other
anticlotting agents unless they are medically necessary.
4. The underlying etiology is treated as soon
as possible (e.g., retinal breaks are sealed
with cryotherapy or laser photocoagulation, detached retinas are repaired, and
proliferative retinal vascular diseases are
treated with laser photocoagulation).

11

5. Surgical removal of the blood (vitrectomy)
is usually performed for:
—VH accompanied by RD or RT on B-scan
US.
—Nonclearing VH, usually persisting ≥3 to
6 months. However, two-thirds of patients
with an idiopathic, fundus-obscuring hemorrhage will have retinal tears or an RD.
Thus, early vitrectomy should be carefully
considered.
—VH with neovascularization of the iris.
—Hemolytic or ghost cell glaucoma.

NOTE: Vitrectomy for isolated VH (e.g., without
RD) may be considered earlier than 6 months
for diabetic patients or those with bilateral VH,
depending on their visual needs.

11.14

Follow-Up
The patient is evaluated daily for the first 2 to
3 days. If a total VH persists, and the etiology
remains unknown, the patient is followed up
with B-scan US every 1 to 3 weeks to rule out
an RD.

CYSTOID MACULAR EDEMA

Symptoms
Decreased vision.

Signs
(See Figures 11.14.1 to 11.14.3.)

the incidence increases with surgical complications including vitreous loss, vitreous to
the wound, and iris prolapse.
 Diabetic retinopathy: See 11.12, Diabetic

Retinopathy.

Critical. Irregularity and blunting of the
foveal light reflex, thickening with or without
small intraretinal cysts in the foveal region.

 CRVO and BRVO: See 11.8, Central Retinal

Other. Loss of the choroidal vascular pattern underlying the macula. Vitreous cells,
optic nerve swelling, and dot hemorrhages
can appear in severe cases. A lamellar macular hole causing permanent visual loss can
develop.

 Uveitis: Particularly pars planitis; see 12.2,

Vein Occlusion, and 11.9, Branch Retinal Vein
Occlusion.
Intermediate Uveitis.
 Retinitis pigmentosa (RP): See 11.28, Reti-

 ARMD: See 11.16, Nonexudative (Dry) Age-

Related Macular Degeneration, and 11.17,
Neovascular or Exudative (Wet) Age-Related

 Others: Intraocular tumors, systemic HTN,

collagen–vascular disease, autosomal dominant CME, others.
 Pseudo-CME (no leakage on IVFA): Nico-

tinic acid maculopathy (typically seen
only with relatively high doses of nicotinic
acid), taxane drugs, X-linked retinoschisis
(can see leakage with ICG), myopic foveal
schisis, Goldmann–Favre disease (and other
NR2E3-related retinopathies), pseudohole
from an epiretinal membrane.

depression inferiorly may be required to
detect pars planitis). Macular examination
is best performed with a slit lamp and a
fundus contact lens, a Hruby lens, or a 60or 90-diopter lens.
3. IVFA shows early leakage out of perifoveal
capillaries and late macular staining, classically in a flower-petal or spoke-wheel pattern. Optic nerve head leakage is sometimes
observed (Irvine–Gass syndrome). Fluorescein leakage does not occur in select cases of
pseudo-CME (see above).
4. OCT can be utilized to document the presence of CME and demonstrate the efficacy
of therapy. OCT outlines the loss of foveal
contour resulting from cystic spaces within
the retina.
5. Other diagnostic tests when indicated: Fasting blood sugar or glucose tolerance test,
ERG, others.

11

NOTE: Subclinical CME commonly develops after
cataract extraction and is noted on IVFA. These
cases are not treated.

Work-Up
1. History: Recent intraocular surgery? Diabetes? Previous uveitis or ocular inflammation? Night blindness or family history of
eye disease? Medications, including topical
epinephrine, dipivefrin, or prostaglandin
analogs?
2. Complete ocular examination, including a peripheral fundus evaluation (scleral

Treatment
Treat the underlying disorder if possible. For
CME related to specific etiologies (e.g., diabetes, retinal vein occlusion, intermediate uveitis, etc.) see specific sections. Seventy percent
of post-cataract CME cases resolve spontaneously within 6 months; treat if symptomatic

1. Topical NSAID (e.g., ketorolac 0.5% q.i.d.
for 3 months).

—Intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy (e.g., bevacizumab 1.25 mg in 0.05 mL).

2. Discontinue topical epinephrine, dipivefrin, or prostaglandin analog drops and
medications containing nicotinic acid.

—Systemic steroids (e.g., prednisone 40 mg
p.o. q.d. for 5 days and then taper over
2 weeks).

3. Consider acetazolamide 500 mg p.o. q.d.,
especially for postoperative patients, but also
for those with RP and uveitis.

—Systemic NSAIDs (e.g., indomethacin
25 mg p.o. t.i.d. for 6 weeks).

4. Other forms of therapy that have unproven
efficacy but are often used include:
—Topical steroids (e.g., prednisolone acetate 1% q.i.d.); often used in combination
with topical NSAID.
—Subtenon steroid (e.g., triamcinolone
40 mg/mL, inject 0.5 to 1.0 mL).
—Intravitreal steroid (e.g., triamcinolone
40 mg/mL, inject 0.05 to 0.1 mL).

11.15

Follow-Up
Postsurgical CME is not an emergency condition. Other forms of CME may require an
etiologic work-up and may benefit from early
treatment (e.g., elimination of nicotinic acid–
containing medications).

CENTRAL SEROUS CHORIORETINOPATHY

Symptoms

11

—CME with or without vitreous incarceration in a surgical wound may be improved
by vitrectomy or yttrium-aluminum garnet
laser lysis of the vitreous strand.

Central scotoma, blurred or dim vision, objects
appear distorted (metamorphopsia) and miniaturized (micropsia), colors appear washed
out. Usually unilateral but 30% to 40% have
evidence of bilateral disease (although may
not be symptomatic at the same time). May be
asymptomatic. Migraine-like headache may
precede or accompany visual changes.

pigment epithelial irregularity may mark sites
of previous episodes.

Differential Diagnosis
These entities may produce a serous detachment of the neurosensory retina in the macular area.

Signs
(See Figure 11.15.1.)
Critical. Localized serous detachment of the
neurosensory retina in the region of the macula without subretinal blood or lipid exudates.
The margins of the detachment are sloping
and merge gradually into the attached retina.
Other. Visual acuity usually ranges from
20/20 to 20/80. Amsler grid testing reveals relative scotoma and distortion of straight lines.
May see a small RAPD, a serous RPE detachment, deposition of subretinal fibrin. Focal

FIGURE 11.15.1. Central serous chorioretinopathy.

23/12/11 1:55 AM

11.15
 ARMD: Patient usually ≥50 years old, dru-

sen, pigment epithelial alterations, may
have choroidal (subretinal) neovascularization, often bilateral. See 11.16, Nonexudative (Dry) Age-Related Macular Degeneration,
and 11.17, Neovascular or Exudative (Wet)
Age-Related Macular Degeneration.
 Optic pit: The optic disc has a small defect

(a pit) in the nerve tissue. A serous RD may
be present, contiguous with the optic disc.
See 11.34, Optic Pit.
 Macular detachment as a result of an RRD

or macular hole: In RRD, a hole in the retina can be found; see 11.3, Retinal Detachment, and 11.25, Macular Hole.
 Choroidal tumor: See 11.36, Choroidal Nevus

and Malignant Melanoma of the Choroid.
 Hypertension: See 11.10, Hypertensive Reti-

nopathy.
 Pigment epithelial detachment (PED): The

margins of a PED are more distinct than
those of CSCR, and the RPE is elevated.
Occasionally, PED may accompany CSCR
or ARMD.
 Others: Idiopathic choroidal effusion, inflam-

matory choroidal disorders, and chronic
renal failure.

Etiology
 Idiopathic: Usually occurs in men aged

25 to 50 years. In women, CSCR typically
occurs at a slightly older age and has an
association with pregnancy. Increased incidence in patients with lupus.

2. Slit-lamp examination of the macula with a
fundus contact, Hruby, or 60- or 90-diopter
lens to rule out a concomitant CNV. In addition, search for an optic pit of the disc.
3. Dilated fundus examination with indirect
ophthalmoscopy to rule out a choroidal
tumor or RRD.
4. IVFA and ICG if the diagnosis is uncertain
or presentation atypical, CNV is suspected,
or laser treatment is to be considered. IVFA
shows the nearly pathognomic “smokestack” pattern of dye leakage in 10% to 20%
of cases. ICG shows choroidal artery and choriocapillaris filling delays and characteristic
multifocal hyperfluorescent patches in the
early phase. OCT can be helpful in demonstrating the subretinal or sub-RPE fluid and
for monitoring purposes. Enhanced-depth
imaging OCT often demonstrates choroidal
thickening and may be a useful adjunct in
diagnosis (see Figures 11.15.2 and 11.15.3).
5. In cases of chronic CSCR, a systemic workup including cortisol levels and renal function should be considered.

Treatment
1. Observation: Prognosis for spontaneous
recovery of visual acuity to at least 20/30
is excellent. Worse prognosis for patients
with recurrent disease, multiple areas of
detachment, or prolonged course.
2. Laser therapy: Accelerates visual recovery.
Does not improve final visual outcome.

11

 Increased endogenous cortisol: This helps

explain a possible association with psychological or physiologic stress (type A personality). Rare cases exist with cortisol producing adrenal adenomas.
 Exogenous

cortisol: Corticosteroid use,
including nasal corticosteroid sprays and
topical creams.

Work-Up
1. Amsler grid test to document the area of
field involved. See Appendix 4, Amsler
Grid.

May increase risk of CNV formation. Given
the CNV risk, use low laser intensity. Consider laser for:
—Persistence of a serous detachment for
several months.
—Recurrence of the condition in an eye
that sustained a permanent visual deficit
from a previous episode.
—Occurrence in the contralateral eye after
a permanent visual deficit resulted from a
previous episode.

—Patient requires prompt restoration of
vision (e.g., occupational necessity).
3. Stop steroids, if possible, including topical
skin preparations and nasal sprays.
4. If CNV develops, consider anti-VEGF therapy.
5. Chronic CSCR may respond to treatment
with photodynamic therapy (PDT).

Follow-Up
1. Examine patients every 6 to 8 weeks until
resolution.

NONEXUDATIVE (DRY) AGE-RELATED
MACULAR DEGENERATION

Symptoms
Gradual loss of central vision, Amsler grid
changes; may be asymptomatic.

Signs
(See Figures 11.16.1 and 11.16.2.)
Critical. Macular drusen, clumps of pigment
in the outer retina, and RPE atrophy, almost
always in both eyes.
Other. Confluent retinal and choriocapillaris
atrophy (e.g., geographic atrophy), dystrophic
calcification.

Differential Diagnosis
 Peripheral drusen: Drusen only located out-

side of the macular area.

LWBK1000-C11_p293-357.indd 322

 Myopic degeneration: Characteristic peri-

papillary changes and macular changes
without drusen. See 11.22, High Myopia.
 CSCR: Parafoveal serous retinal elevation,

RPE detachments, and mottled RPE atrophy, without drusen, usually in patients
<50 years of age. See 11.15, Central Serous
Chorioretinopathy.
 Inherited central retinal dystrophies: Star-

gardt disease, pattern dystrophy, Best disease, others. Variable macular pigmentary
changes, atrophy, or accumulation of lipofuscin or a combination of these. Usually
<50 years, without drusen, familial occurrence. See specific entities.

3. Macular examination with a 60- or 90-diopter
or a fundus contact lens: Look for risk factors for conversion to the exudative form,
such as soft drusen or pigment clumping.
Look for signs of the exudative form (disappearance of drusen may herald the development of CNV).
4. Baseline and periodic fundus autofluorecsence
may be useful to monitor for progression.

FIGURE 11.16.1. Dry ARMD with fine drusen.

 Toxic retinopathies: e.g., chloroquine tox-

icity. Mottled hypopigmentation with ring
of hyperpigmentation (bull’s-eye maculopathy) without drusen. Possible history of
drug ingestion or exposure.
 Inflammatory

maculopathies: Multifocal
choroiditis, rubella, serpiginous choroidopathy, and others. Variable chorioretinal
atrophy, often with vitreous cells and without drusen. See specific entities.

Work-Up
1. History: Presence of risk factors (e.g., family history, smoking, obesity, HTN, hypercholesterolemia)? See risk factors for loss
of vision, 11.17, Neovascular or Exudative
(Wet) Age-Related Macular Degeneration.
2. Amsler grid to document or detect a central or paracentral scotoma. See Appendix
4, Amsler Grid.

5. IVFA or OCT when exudative ARMD cannot
be ruled out clinically, when RPE detachment is present, or when visual acuity has
declined rapidly to rule out CNV. Drusen and
RPE atrophy are often more visible on IVFA.

Treatment
1. People with intermediate dry ARMD [one
large druse (125 microns) and/or ≥20
medium drusen (63 to 125 microns)], or
advanced dry or exudative ARMD in one eye
but not the other eye, are at high risk for the
development of advanced stages of ARMD.
Per the Age-Related Eye Disease Study
(AREDS) report, treatment with a high-dose
combination of vitamin C (500 mg), vitamin
E (400 IU), beta-carotene (15 mg), zinc (80
mg), and cupric oxide (5 mg) reduces the
risk of progression to advanced ARMD by
approximately 25% over 5 years and reduces
the risk of vision loss caused by advanced
ARMD by approximately 19% by 5 years.
NOTE: Beta-carotene should be withheld in past
or present smokers because of increased risk of
lung cancer. A formulation of the AREDS vitamins
without beta-carotene for current or past smokers is available.

11

In addition, recommend consumption of
green leafy vegetables if approved by primary
care physician (intake of vitamin K decreases
effectiveness of warfarin) and fish/fish oils
containing high levels of omega-3 fatty acids..
2. Low-vision aids may benefit some patients
with bilateral loss of macular function.
3. Refer to an internist for management of
presumed risk factors: HTN, hypercholesterolemia, smoking cessation, etc.
FIGURE 11.16.2. Dry ARMD with soft drusen.

brown or gray irregular bands often radiating from the optic disc. See 11.23, Angioid
Streaks.
 High myopia: Significant myopic refractive

error, lacquer cracks, tilted disc. See 11.22,
High Myopia.
 Idiopathic

polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (IPCV): Multiple serosanguineous
macular and RPE detachments. ICG angiography highlights characteristic polyplike
aneurysmal dilations. Prognosis is more
favorable than for exudative ARMD. See
11.18, Idiopathic Polypoidal Choroidal Vasculopathy (Posterior Uveal Bleeding Syndrome).

 Other CNV-predisposing conditions include

drusen of the optic nerve, choroidal rupture, choroidal tumors, photocoagulation
scars, inflammatory focal chorioretinal
spots, and idiopathic causes.

Types of Neovascular ARMD Lesions
 Classic CNV: Early-phase IVFA demon-

strates a well-delineated area of lacy hyperfluorescence with prominent leakage in
later phases.
 Occult CNV: Ill defined, stippled, flat, or

elevated subtle late leakage.
 RAP: Focal intraretinal hyperfluorescence

on IVFA and ICGA. High-speed ICGA is
particularly sensitive and may show characteristic “hair pin loop” with retinal feeder
and draining vessels.

Work-Up
1. Slit-lamp biomicroscopy with a 60-, 78-, or
90-diopter, or fundus contact lens to detect
CNV and associated exudation. Must examine both eyes.
2. Perform IVFA if CNV is suspected. IVFA is useful to confirm neovascular ARMD and specifically determine the size, type, and location of
CNV, and monitor treatment response.
3. OCT is helpful in determining retinal thickness, CNV thickness, and extent of ME, SRF

LWBK1000-C11_p293-357.indd 325

Treatment
Subfoveal CNV
—Ranibizumab: Anti-VEGF antibody fragment injected intravitreally that is FDA
approved for all subfoveal CNV subtypes. The
optimal dosing regimen has yet to be determined. In the original phase 3 efficacy trials
(MARINA and ANCHOR), ranibizumab was
given monthly to patients with close to 40%
of patients in both studies gaining three or
more lines of visual acuity at 1 year. While the
best visual results may occur with monthly
dosing, prn dosing using OCT guidance
(PrONTO study) had similar 1 year visual
results with half the number of injections.
—Aflibercept: Anti-VEGF fusion protein
that binds all isoforms of VEGF-A and placental growth factor that is injected intravitreally and is FDA approved for the treatment of neovascular ARMD. The optimal
dosing regimen has yet to be determined,
but phase 3 studies showed similar efficacy
at one year to monthly intravitreal ranibizumab with aflibercept dosed q8weeks after
a 12 week monthly induction phase.
—Bevacizumab: Full-length anti-VEGF antibody. FDA approved for colon cancer. Offlabel use as intravitreal injection at a dose
of 1.25 mg is effective in treating all types of
neovascular ARMD. It is cost-effective and
commonly used in place of ranibizumab.
The Comparison of Age-related macular
degeneration Treatments Trial (CATT) study
demonstrated the non-inferiority of bevacizumab as compared to ranibizumab at 1
year, when monthly or prn dosing was used.

11

—Pegaptanib: Anti-VEGF aptamer injected
intravitreally every 6 weeks for 1 to 2
years. FDA approved for all subfoveal CNV
subtypes. Pegaptanib reduces the risk of
vision loss, but rarely improves visual acuity.
Rarely used.

Retina

—PDT: FDA approved intravenous infusion of photosensitizing dye (verteporfin)
followed by nondestructive (cold) laser
application to activate the dye within the
CNV. PDT can be performed as often as
every 3 months for 1 to 2 years. Small,
classic subfoveal CNV responds best, but
small occult or minimally classic subfoveal CNV may also respond. PDT decreases
vision loss, but does not improve vision as
monotherapy. It is rarely used.
Nonsubfoveal CNV
—Anti-VEGF agents are the treatment of
choice for nonsubfoveal CNV. See above
for details.
—Thermal laser photocoagulation: Results
are best for extrafoveal CNV (≥200 mm
from fovea). Laser photocoagulation treatment is complicated by high CNV recurrence rates. Rarely used.

11

Patients receiving intravitreal injections should
be given warning symptoms for endophthalmitis and RD.

IDIOPATHIC POLYPOIDAL CHOROIDAL
VASCULOPATHY (POSTERIOR UVEAL
BLEEDING SYNDROME)

Symptoms

Risk Factors

Decreased central vision; may be sudden or
gradual.

More common in females, individuals of
African or Asian descent, and in patients
with HTN. Can occur at a younger age compared with neovascular ARMD without significant drusen or geographic atrophy.

Signs
Critical. Subretinal red-orange, polyp-like
lesions of the choroidal vasculature. Can be
macular (more symptomatic) or peripapillary.
Other. Subretinal and/or sub-RPE blood, VH,
circinate subretinal exudates, subretinal fibrosis (disciform scar), subretinal fluid, atypical
CNV, and multiple serous PEDs.

 Peripheral exudative hemorrhagic chorio-

retinopathy [PEHCR (extramacular degeneration)]: This is the peripheral form of
ARMD and affects the ora serrata region
with RPE atrophy, RPE detachment, subretinal blood, and exudation.

Work-Up
1. Slit-lamp biomicroscopy with a 60-,
90-diopter, or fundus contact lens to detect
signs of exudation.
2. IVFA is performed to rule out other causes
of CNV.
3. OCT is used to assess ME, subretinal fluid,
and the presence of any PEDs.
4. ICG may confirm the presence of a branching network of vessels arising from the
inner choroidal circulation with terminal
aneurysmal dilations (popcorn lesions).
Unlike occult CNV, the IPCV lesions do not
stain late unless active leakage is present.

Retinal Arterial Macroaneurysm

327

Treatment
Asymptomatic lesions may be observed. Many
resolve spontaneously. IPCV with severe recurrent exudation and/or hemorrhagic complications has been treated with anti-VEGF agents,
thermal laser photocoagulation, PDT, feeder
vessel treatment, submacular surgery, macular translocation, steroid injection, and pneumatic displacement of large submacular hemorrhage.

Follow-Up
The prognosis of IPCV is generally better than
for neovascular ARMD. Symptomatic or macular IPCV is followed every 1 to 2 months with
repeat OCT, IVFA, and ICG as needed for new
developments. Consider treatment or retreatment if symptomatic persistent or new leakage
can be demonstrated.

RETINAL ARTERIAL MACROANEURYSM

Symptoms
Decreased vision; history of systemic HTN.
Usually unilateral, but 10% bilateral.

Signs
(See Figures 11.19.1 and 11.19.2.)

FIGURE 11.19.1. Retinal artery macroaneurysm on

Critical. Acute hemorrhages in multiple layers of the retina (subretinal, intraretinal, subinternal limiting membrane) and VH often with
a white or yellow spot in the middle, which is
probably fibrin. Chronic leakage may manifest
as a ring of hard exudates and retinal edema

around the aneurysm resulting in decreased
vision if the macula is involved.
Other. ME, arteriolar emboli, capillary telangiectasia, arterial or venous occlusions distal
to macroaneurysm.

Differential Diagnosis
 Coats disease: Unilateral retinal vascular tel-

angiectasias. Extensive yellow intraretinal
and subretinal exudates. Hemorrhages not
typical. See 8.1, Leukocoria.
 Idiopathic retinal vasculitis, aneurysms,

and neuroretinitis (IRVAN): A syndrome
characterized by retinal vasculitis, multiple
arterial macroaneurysms, neuroretinitis,
and peripheral capillary nonperfusion.
 Diabetic retinopathy: Hemorrhages are not

subretinal. See 11.12, Diabetic Retinopathy.
 Valsalva retinopathy: No associated hard

exudates. See 11.21, Valsalva Retinopathy.
 Retinal telangiectasias: Juxtafoveal or para-

foveal retinal telangiectasias cause hard
exudates often in a circinate pattern usually
temporal to macula. High association with
diabetes.
 Others:

Retinal capillary hemangioma
(hemangioblastoma), retinal cavernous hemangioma, choroidal melanoma, hemorrhagic
RPE detachment seen in ARMD, IPCV, etc.

Etiology

11

Acquired vascular dilation of retinal artery or
arteriole usually at site of arteriolar bifurcation
or arteriovenous crossing. Usually related to systemic HTN and general arteriosclerotic disease.

11.20

Work-Up
1. History: Systemic disease, particularly HTN
or diabetes?
2. Complete ocular examination with dilated
retinal examination with a 60- or 90-diopter
lens and indirect ophthalmoscopy. Look
for concurrent retinal venous obstruction,
present in one-third of cases and signs of
hypertensive retinopathy (visible in fellow
eye as well).
3. Check the blood pressure.
4. Consider checking fasting or random blood
sugar and lipid panel.
5. IVFA may demonstrate early hyperfluorescence if there is no blockage from hemorrhage. Late frames may show leakage or
staining of vessel wall.
6. OCT is helpful in demonstrating and following any ME that may be present.

Treatment
Bleeding is typically not treated since it usually only occurs once secondary to thrombosis and spontaneous involution. Consider
laser treatment if edema and/or exudate
threatens central vision. Caution must be
taken when treating arterioles that supply the
central macula since distal thrombosis and
obstruction can occur. Laser can also cause
aneurysmal rupture resulting in retinal and
vitreous hemorrhage.

Follow-Up
Frequency based on the amount and location
of exudate and hemorrhage.

SICKLE CELL DISEASE (INCLUDING
SICKLE CELL ANEMIA, SICKLE TRAIT)

Symptoms
Usually without ocular symptoms. Floaters,
flashing lights, or loss of vision with advanced
disease. Systemically, patients often have
painful crises with severe abdominal or mus-

Critical. Peripheral retinal neovascularization in the shape of a fan (“sea-fan sign”),
sclerosed peripheral retinal vessels, or a dull
gray peripheral fundus background color as a
result of peripheral arteriolar occlusions and
ischemia.
Other. Venous tortuosity, mid-peripheral
fundus pigmented lesions with spiculated
borders (black sunbursts), superficial intraretinal hemorrhages (salmon patch), refractile (iridescent) intraretinal deposits following hemorrhage resorption, angioid streaks,
comma-shaped capillaries of the conjunctiva
(especially along the inferior fornix). VH and
traction bands, RD, CRAO, macular arteriolar occlusions, and enlargement of the foveal
avascular zone occasionally develop.

Staging
 Stage 1: Peripheral arteriolar occlusions.

 Others: Retinopathy of prematurity, FEVR,

chronic myelogenous leukemia, radiation
retinopathy, pars planitis, carotid–cavernous fistula, ocular ischemic syndrome OLS,

cell disease, diabetes, or known medical
problems? intravenous drug abuse?
2. Dilated fundus examination using indirect
ophthalmoscopy.
3. Sickledex, sickle cell preparation, and
hemoglobin electrophoresis.
NOTE: Patients with sickle cell trait, as well as
hemoglobin C disease, may have a negative Sickledex preparation.

larization often associated with uveitis.

LWBK1000-C11_p293-357.indd 329

Treatment
There are no well-established indications or
guidelines for treatment. Isolated retinal neovascularization is not an indication. Neovascularization with associated VH is an indication for PRP to the avascular area anterior to
the neovascularization. Retinal detachment
and VH may be best treated with vitrectomy.
Anti-VEGF agents may be beneficial, but caution should be used in cases of significant
traction.

11.21

2. Retinopathy present: Repeat dilated fundus
examination every 3 to 6 months, depending on severity.

VALSALVA RETINOPATHY

Symptoms
Decreased vision or asymptomatic. History
of Valsalva maneuver (forceful exhalation
against a closed glottis), which may occur during heavy lifting, coughing, vomiting, constipation, straining. Sometimes no history of
Valsalva can be elicited.

Signs
(See Figure 11.21.1.)
Critical. Single or multiple hemorrhage(s)
under the internal limiting membrane (ILM)
in the area of the macula. Can be unilateral
or bilateral. Blood may turn yellow after a few
days.
Other. Vitreous and subretinal hemorrhage
can occur, as well as subconjunctival hemorrhage.

Differential Diagnosis
 PVD: Can cause VH acutely as well as periph-

eral retinal and disc margin hemorrhages.

11

However, typically no sub-ILM hemorrhage.
See 11.1, Posterior Vitreous Detachment.
 Retinal arterial macroaneurysm: Hemor-

rhages in multiple layers of the retina and
vitreous. Can also have a circinate ring of
hard exudates around a macroaneurysm.
See 11.19, Retinal Arterial Macroaneurysm.
 Diabetic

retinopathy: Microaneurysms,
dot-blot hemorrhages, and hard exudates
bilaterally, not isolated sub-ILM hemorrhage. Both can cause VH. See 11.12, Diabetic Retinopathy.

 CRVO

or BRVO: Unilateral, multiple
intraretinal hemorrhages, venous dilation,
and tortuosity. See 11.8, Central Retinal
Vein Occlusion, and 11.9, Branch Retinal Vein
Occlusion.

 Anemia or leukemia: May have multiple,

bilateral flame and dot-blot hemorrhages as
well as cotton-wool spots. Can also present
with sub-ILM hemorrhage.
 Retinal tear: Can be surrounded by hemor-

rhage obscuring the tear. Tears rarely occur
in the macula.

Etiology
Valsalva causes sudden increase in intraocular
venous pressure leading to rupture of superficial capillaries in macula. May be associated
with anticoagulant therapy.

2. Complete ocular examination, including
dilated retinal examination with a slit lamp
and a 60- or 90-diopter lens, and indirect
ophthalmoscopy. Look for findings suggestive of a different etiology including microaneurysms, dot-blot hemorrhages, cottonwool spots, retinal tear, PVD.
3. If dense VH is present, then obtain B-scan
US to rule out a retinal tear or detachment.
4. IVFA may be helpful to rule out other
causes including retinal arterial macroaneurysm or diabetic retinopathy.

High Myopia

331

Treatment
Prognosis is excellent. Most patients are observed
as sub-ILM hemorrhage usually resolves after
a few days to weeks. Occasionally laser is used
to permit the blood to drain into the vitreous
cavity thereby uncovering the macula. Vitrectomy rarely considered, typically only for nonclearing VH.

Follow-Up
May follow-up every 2 weeks for the initial
visits to monitor for resolution, then followup routinely.

HIGH MYOPIA

Symptoms
Decreased vision, usually does not progress
until the fifth decade of life.

Signs
(See Figure 11.22.1.)
Critical. Myopic crescent (a crescent-shaped
area of white sclera or choroidal vessels adjacent to the disc, separated from the normalappearing fundus by a hyperpigmented line);
an oblique (tilted) insertion of the optic disc,
with or without vertical elongation; macular
pigmentary abnormalities; a hyperpigmented
spot in the macula (Fuchs spot); typically, a

refractive correction of more than –6.00 to
–8.00 diopters, axial length ≥26 mm.
Other. Temporal optic disc pallor, posterior
staphyloma, entrance of the retinal vessels into
the nasal part of the optic cup, the retina and
choroid may be seen to extend over the nasal
border of the optic disc, well-circumscribed
areas of atrophy, spots of subretinal hemorrhage, choroidal sclerosis, yellow subretinal
streaks (lacquer cracks), peripheral retinal thinning, lattice degeneration. Risk for CNV or
RRD. Visual field defects may be present.

Differential Diagnosis
 ARMD: May develop CNV and a similar

macular appearance, but typically drusen are present, and the myopic disc features are absent. See 11.16, Nonexudative
(Dry) Age-Related Macular Degeneration, and
11.17, Neovascular or Exudative (Wet) AgeRelated Macular Degeneration.

11

 Ocular histoplasmosis: Peripapillary atro-

phy with risk for CNV. A pigmented ring
may separate the disc from the peripapillary
atrophy, as opposed to pigmented ring separating the atrophic area from the adjacent
retina. Round choroidal scars (punched-out
lesions) are scattered throughout the fundus. See 11.24, Ocular Histoplasmosis.

irregular vascular pattern as the vessels
emerge from the disc (situs inversus), and
an area of fundus ectasia in the direction of
the tilt (inferonasally). Many patients have
myopia and astigmatism but no chorioretinal degeneration or lacquer cracks. Visual
field defects corresponding to the areas of
fundus ectasia are often seen. Most cases
are bilateral.
 Gyrate atrophy: Rare. Multiple, well-demar-

cated areas of chorioretinal atrophy beginning in the mid-periphery in childhood
and then coalescing to involve a large portion of the fundus. Increased blood levels
of ornithine. Patients are often highly
myopic. See 11.28, Retinitis Pigmentosa and
Inherited Chorioretinal Dystrophies.
 Toxoplasmosis: Well-circumscribed chorio-

retinal scar that does not typically develop
CNV; active disease shows retinitis and vitritis. See 12.5, Toxoplasmosis.

Work-Up
1. Manifest and/or cycloplegic refraction.
2. IOP measurement by applanation tonometry (Schiøtz tonometry may underestimate
IOP in highly myopic eyes).
3. Dilated retinal examination with indirect ophthalmoscopy to search for retinal
breaks or detachment. Scleral depression
may be helpful but should be performed
with care over a staphyloma.

11

4. Slit-lamp and fundus contact, or 60- or
90-diopter lens examination of the macula,
searching for CNV (gray or green lesion
beneath the retina, subretinal blood or exudate, or SRF).

11.23

Usually asymptomatic; decreased vision may
result from CNV.

(See Figure 11.23.1.)

LWBK1000-C11_p293-357.indd 332

6. OCT can reveal macular detachment over a
staphyloma. Additionally, OCT can be useful
in identifying foveal schisis, a possible cause
of vision loss in patients with high myopia.

Treatment
1. Symptomatic retinal breaks are treated
with laser photocoagulation, cryotherapy,
or scleral buckling surgery. Treatment of
asymptomatic retinal breaks may be considered when there is no surrounding pigmentation or demarcation line.
2. Anti-VEGF agents are used for all CNV subtypes associated with high myopia. Laser
photocoagulation therapy may be considered for extrafoveal or juxtafoveal CNV
within several days of obtaining an IVFA.
PDT may also be considered, but, like laser
photocoagulation, is rarely used. See 11.17,
Neovascular or Exudative (Wet) Age-Related
Macular Degeneration.
3. For glaucoma suspects, a single visual field
often cannot distinguish myopic visual
field loss from early glaucoma. Progression
of visual field loss in the absence of progressive myopia, however, suggests the presence of glaucoma and the need for therapy.
See 9.1, Primary Open-Angle Glaucoma.
4. Recommend one-piece polycarbonate safety
goggles for sports because of increased risk
of choroidal rupture from minor trauma.

Follow-Up
In the absence of complications, reexamine
every 6 to 12 months, watching for the related
disorders discussed earlier.

Etiology
Fifty percent of cases are associated with
systemic diseases; the remainder are idiopathic.
 PXE: Most common. Loose skin folds in

the neck, axillae, and on flexor aspects
of joints, cardiovascular complications,
increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeds.
 Ehlers–Danlos syndrome: Hyperelasticity of

skin, loose joints.
 Paget disease of bone: Enlarged skull, bone

pain, history of bone fractures, hearing
loss, possible cardiovascular complications.
May be asymptomatic. Increased serum
alkaline phosphatase and urine calcium.

LWBK1000-C11_p293-357.indd 333

Work-Up
1. History: Any known systemic disorders?
Previous ocular trauma?
2. Complete ocular examination: Look carefully at the macula with a slit lamp and a
60- or 90-diopter, or a fundus contact lens
to detect CNV.
3. IVFA if diagnosis uncertain or CNV suspected.
4. Physical examination: Look for clinical
signs of etiologic diseases.
5. Serum alkaline phosphatase and urine
calcium levels if Paget disease of bone is
suspected.
6. Sickle cell preparation and hemoglobin
electrophoresis in patients of African
descent.
7. Skin or scar biopsy if PXE is suspected.

11

Treatment
1. Anti-VEGF therapy is now used for angioid streak-associated CNV, as focal laser
photocoagulation and PDT have disappointing outcomes. See 11.17, Neovascular or Exudative (Wet) Age-Related Macular
Degeneration.
2. Management of any underlying systemic
disease, if present, by an internist.
3. Recommend wearing one-piece polycarbonate safety glasses for sports because
there is an increased risk of subretinal hemorrhage and choroidal rupture from minor
trauma.

OCULAR HISTOPLASMOSIS

Symptoms
Most often asymptomatic; can present with
decreased or distorted vision, especially when
CNV develops. Patients often have lived in or
visited the Ohio–Mississippi River Valley or
areas where histoplasmosis is endemic. Usually in the 20- to 50-year age range.

3. Peripapillary atrophy or scarring, sometimes with nodules or hemorrhage. There
may be a rim of pigment separating the disc

of pigment on the outer (not inner) edge,
separating the crescent from the retina.
Atrophic spots are whiter than histo-spots
and are not seen beyond the posterior pole.
See 11.22, High Myopia.
 ARMD: Macular changes may appear simi-

lar, but typically there are macular drusen
and patients are ≥50 years of age. There are

Age-Related Macular Degeneration, and 11.17,
Neovascular or Exudative (Wet) Age-Related
Macular Degeneration.
 Old toxoplasmosis: White chorioretinal

lesion with vitreous and sometimes aqueous cells. See 12.5, Toxoplasmosis.
 Angioid streaks: Histo-like spots in the mid-

periphery and macular degeneration may
occur. Jagged red, brown, or gray lines deep
to the retinal vessels and radiating from the
optic disc. See 11.23, Angioid Streaks.
 Multifocal

choroiditis with panuveitis:
Similar clinical findings, except anterior or
vitreous inflammatory cells or both are also
present. See 12.3, Posterior Uveitis.

 Multiple evanescent white dot syndrome

(MEWDS): Multiple, creamy white lesions
at the level of the outer retina or the RPE
with an orange, granular appearance to
the fovea, and occasional peripheral scintillation. Few vitreous cells and occasional
sheathing of vessels. Enlarged blind spot.
Vision typically returns to normal within
weeks without treatment.

Etiology
Fungal infection caused by Histoplasma capsulatum. Once acquired by inhalation, the
organisms can pass to the choroid through
the bloodstream.

Work-Up
1. History: Time spent in the Ohio–Mississippi
River Valley or endemic area? Prior exposure to fowl?
2. Amsler grid test (see Appendix 4, Amsler
Grid) to evaluate the central visual field of
each eye.
3. Slit-lamp examination: Anterior chamber
or vitreous cells and flare should not be
present.

4. Dilated fundus examination: Concentrate
on the macular area with a slit lamp and
fundus contact, or 60- or 90-diopter lens.
Look for signs of CNV and vitreous cells.
5. IVFA and OCT to help detect CNV and
monitor response to treatment.

Treatment
1. Antifungal treatment is not helpful.
2. Intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy for CNV.
PDT (for subfoveal CNV) and focal laser
photocoagulation (for extrafoveal CNV)
may be used as initial treatments as well.
Submacular surgery may be considered in
the setting of medically unresponsive subfoveal CNV if vision is <20/100.

Follow-Up
1. Treatment should be instituted within
72 hours of confirming the presence of
CNV by IVFA.
2. Instruct all patients to use an Amsler grid
daily and return immediately if any sudden
visual change is noted.
3. Patients treated with anti-VEGF injections are generally seen every 4 to 6 weeks,
depending on the clinical response to
therapy. Patients treated with PDT or focal
laser are typically seen at 2 to 3 weeks, 4
to 6 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months after
treatment and then every 6 months thereafter.

11

4. A careful macular examination and OCT
is performed at each visit. IVFA may be
repeated whenever renewed neovascular
activity is suspected.
5. Patients without CNV are seen every
6 months when macular changes are present in one or both eyes and yearly when
no macular disease is present in either
eye.

MACULAR HOLE

Symptoms

Staging

Decreased vision, typically around the 20/200
level for a full-thickness hole, better for a
partial-thickness hole; sometimes distortion
of vision or central scotoma. Three times more
likely in women; usually occurs in sixth to
eighth decade. 10% bilateral.

 Stage 1: An impending hole, yellow spot, or

Signs

 Stage 4: Full-thickness hole with cuff of SRF,

(See Figures 11.25.1 and 11.25.2.)
Critical. A round, red spot in the center of
the macula, usually from one-third to twothirds of a disc diameter in size, surrounded by
a gray halo [(cuff of subretinal fluid (SRF)]. A
stage 1 idiopathic macular hole demonstrates
loss of the normal foveolar depression and
often a yellow spot or ring in the center of the
macula.
Other. Small, yellow precipitates deep to the
retina in the hole or surrounding retina; retinal cysts at the margin of the hole or a small
operculum above the hole, anterior to the
retina (stage 4); or both.

with complete PVD.

Differential Diagnosis
 Macular pucker with a pseudohole: An

epiretinal membrane (surface wrinkling)
on the surface of the retina may simulate
a macular hole. See 11.26, Epiretinal Membrane (Macular Pucker, Surface-Wrinkling Retinopathy, Cellophane Maculopathy).
 Solar retinopathy: Small, round, red or yel-

low lesion at the center of the fovea, with
surrounding fine gray pigment in a sungazer or eclipse watcher. See 11.35, Solar
Retinopathy.
 Intraretinal cysts: e.g., chronic CME with

11

prominent central cyst.

Etiology
May be caused by vitreous or epiretinal membrane traction on the macula, trauma, or CME.

Work-Up
1. History: Previous trauma? Previous eye surgery? Sun-gazer?
2. Complete ocular examination, including a
macular examination with a slit lamp and
60- or 90-diopter lens, or fundus contact
lens. If a PVD is present, careful examination of the peripheral fundus to rule out
peripheral breaks is important.

FIGURE 11.25.1. Macular hole.

LWBK1000-C11_p293-357.indd 336

3. A true macular hole can be differentiated
from a pseudohole by directing a thin, vertical slit beam across the area in question by
using a 60- or 90-diopter lens with the slitlamp biomicroscope. The patient with a true
hole will report a break in the line (Watzke–

Allen test). A pseudohole may cause distortion of the line, but it should not be broken.
4. IVFA in stage 2 to 4 macular holes shows
early foveal hyperfluorescence without evidence of leakage in the late phase.
5. OCT is helpful for staging, evaluating progression, and determining the degree of
traction from vitreous or epiretinal membranes (see Figure 11.25.3).

Treatment
1. Fifty percent of stage 1 premacular holes
resolve spontaneously.

2. In selected cases of more advanced macular holes, vitrectomy with membrane peel
may be beneficial. It is preferable to operate within the first 6 months of onset with
the possibility of regaining half of the
visual angle. The risk of RD is very small.
However, symptoms of an RD (e.g., sudden
increase in flashes and floaters, abundant
“cobwebs” in the vision, or a curtain coming across the field of vision) are explained
to patients, particularly those with high
myopia. It is in the latter group that the
macular hole sometimes leads to an RD,
which requires surgical repair.

Follow-Up
1. Patients with high myopia are seen every
6 months.

4. Because there is a small risk that the condition may develop in the contralateral eye,
patients are given an Amsler grid for periodic home monitoring.

2. Other patients may be seen yearly.
3. All patients are seen sooner if RD symptoms
develop.

EPIRETINAL MEMBRANE (MACULAR
PUCKER, SURFACE-WRINKLING
RETINOPATHY, CELLOPHANE MACULOPATHY)

Symptoms
Most are asymptomatic; can have decreased
or distorted vision or both. Typically occurs in
middle-aged or elderly patients. Twenty percent bilateral.

Signs
(See Figure 11.26.1.)
Critical. Spectrum ranges from a fine, glistening membrane (cellophane maculopathy)
to a thick, gray–white membrane (macular
pucker) present on the surface of the retina in
the macular area.

11

Other. Retinal folds radiating out from the
membrane, displacement, straightening or
tortuosity of the macular retinal vessels, ME,
or detachment. A round, dark condensation

of the epiretinal membrane in the macula
may simulate a macular hole (pseudohole).

Differential Diagnosis
 Diabetic retinopathy: May produce prereti-

nal fibrovascular tissue, which may displace
retinal vessels or detach the macula. ME
may be present. See 11.12, Diabetic Retinopathy.
 CME. See 11.14, Cystoid Macular Edema.

Etiology
 Idiopathic.
 Retinal break, RRD. See 11.2, Retinal break,

and 11.3, Retinal Detachment.
 PVD. See 11.1, Posterior Vitreous Detachment.
 After retinal cryotherapy or photocoagula-

tion.
 After intraocular surgery, trauma, or vitre-

ous hemorrhage.
 Uveitis. See Chapter 12, Uveitis.

and a 60- or 90-diopter, Hruby, or fundus
contact lens. A careful peripheral examination should be performed to rule out a retinal break.
3. OCT is helpful in evaluating epiretinal
membranes (see Figure 11.26.2).

Treatment
1. Treat the underlying disorder.

11.27

2. Surgical peeling of the membrane can be
considered when it significantly reduces
the vision.

Follow-Up
This is not an emergent condition, and treatment may be instituted at any time. Rarely,
membranes separate from the retina, resulting in spontaneously improved vision. A small
percentage of epiretinal membranes recur after
surgical removal.

CHOROIDAL EFFUSION/DETACHMENT

11

Symptoms
Decreased vision or asymptomatic in a serous
choroidal detachment. Decreased vision may
occur if the choroidal detachments extend
through the macula. Moderate-to-severe pain
and red eye may also occur with a hemorrhagic choroidal detachment.

Signs
(See Figure 11.27.1.)
Critical. Smooth, bullous, orange-brown
elevation of the retina and choroid that usually extends 360 degrees around the periphery
in a lobular configuration. The ora serrata can
be seen without scleral depression.

Retina

Other.
Serous choroidal detachment: Low IOP (often
<6 mm Hg), shallow anterior chamber with
mild cell and flare, positive transillumination.
Hemorrhagic choroidal detachment: High IOP
(if detachment is large), shallow anterior
chamber with mild cell and flare, no transillumination.

Differential Diagnosis
 Melanoma of the ciliary body: Not typically

multilobular or symmetric in each quadrant
of the globe. Pigmented melanomas do not
transilluminate. B-scan US may help to differentiate between the two. See 11.36, Choroidal Nevus and Malignant Melanoma of the
Choroid.
 Rhegmatogenous

retinal
detachment:
Appears white and undulates with eye
movements. A break is usually seen in the
retina, and pigment cells are often present in
the vitreous. See 11.3, Retinal Detachment.

Etiology
Serous
 Intraoperative or postoperative: Wound
leak, perforation of the sclera from a superior rectus bridle suture, iritis, cyclodialysis
cleft, leakage or excess filtration from a filtering bleb, or after laser photocoagulation
or cryotherapy. May occur days to weeks
after the surgery.

11

 Traumatic: Often associated with a rup-

tured globe.
 After retinal detachment repair by scleral

buckling or vitrectomy.
 Other: Nanophthalmos, uveal effusion syn-

drome, carotid–cavernous fistula, primary
or metastatic tumor, scleritis, VKH syndrome, etc. See specific sections.
Hemorrhagic
 Intraoperative or postoperative: From anterior displacement of the ocular contents
and rupture of the short posterior ciliary arteries.
 Spontaneous: e.g., after perforation of a

corneal ulcer.

LWBK1000-C11_p293-357.indd 340

Work-Up
1. History: Recent ocular surgery or trauma?
Known eye or medical problem?
2. Slit-lamp examination: Check for the presence of a filtering bleb and perform Seidel
test to rule out a wound leak. See Appendix
5, Seidel Test to Detect a Wound Leak.
3. Gonioscopy of the anterior chamber angle:
Look for a cyclodialysis cleft.
4. Dilated retinal examination: Determine
whether there is subretinal fluid, indicating
a concomitant RD, and whether an underlying choroidal disease or tumor is present.
Examination of the contralateral eye may
be helpful in diagnosis.
5. In cases suggestive of melanoma, B-scan
US and transillumination of the globe are
helpful in making a diagnosis. B-scan US is
also useful to distinguish between serous and
hemorrhagic choroidal detachment and in
determining if hemorrhage is mobile or coagulated.
6. Check the skin for vitiligo and the head for
alopecia (e.g., VKH syndrome).

Treatment
General Treatment
1. Cycloplegic (e.g., atropine 1% t.i.d.).
2. Topical steroid (e.g., prednisolone acetate
1% four to six times per day).
3. Consider oral steroids.
4. Surgical drainage of the suprachoroidal fluid
may be indicated for a flat or progressively
shallow anterior chamber, particularly in the
presence of inflammation (because of the
risk of peripheral anterior synechiae), corneal decompensation resulting from lens–
cornea touch, or “kissing” choroidals (apposition of two lobules of detached choroid).
Specific Treatment: Repair the Underlying Problem
1. Serous
—Wound or filtering bleb leak: Patch for
24 hours, decrease steroids and add aqueous suppressants, suture the site, use cyanoacrylate glue, place a bandage contact
lens on the eye, or a combination of these.

Retinitis Pigmentosa and Inherited Chorioretinal Dystrophies

—Cyclodialysis cleft: Laser therapy, diathermy, cryotherapy, or suture the cleft to
close it.
—Uveitis: Topical cycloplegic and steroid
as discussed previously.
—Inflammatory disease: See the specific
entity.
—RD: Surgical repair. Proliferative vitreoretinopathy after repair is common.

11.28

341

2. Hemorrhagic: Drainage of the choroidal
detachment with or without vitrectomy is
performed for severe cases with retina or
vitreous to the wound. More successful if
hemorrhage is liquefied, which occurs 7 to
10 days after the initial event. Otherwise
use general treatment.

Follow-Up
In accordance with the underlying problem.

RETINITIS PIGMENTOSA AND INHERITED
CHORIORETINAL DYSTROPHIES

RETINITIS PIGMENTOSA
Symptoms
Decreased night vision (often night blindness)
and loss of peripheral vision. Decrease in central vision can occur early or late in the disease
process. Color vision is intact until late.

Signs
(See Figure 11.28.1.)
Critical. Classically, vitreous cells (most
consistent sign), clumps of pigment dispersed

throughout the peripheral retina in a perivascular pattern, often assuming a “bone spicule”
arrangement (though bone spicules may be
absent), areas of depigmentation or atrophy
of the RPE, narrowing of arterioles, and, later,
waxy optic disc pallor. Progressive visual field
loss, usually a ring scotoma, which progresses
to a small central field. ERG usually moderately to markedly reduced.
Other. Focal or sectoral pigment clumping,
CME, epiretinal membrane, posterior subcapsular cataract.

Inheritance Patterns
 Autosomal recessive (most common): Di-

minished vision (severe) and night blindness occur early in life.

11

 Autosomal dominant (least severe): More

gradual onset of retinitis pigmentosa (RP),
typically in adult life, variable penetrance,
late onset of cataract. Visual loss less severe.
 X-linked recessive (rarest and most severe):

Onset similar to autosomal recessive.
Female carriers often have salt-and-pepper
fundus. Visual loss is severe.
 Sporadic.

SYSTEMIC DISEASES ASSOCIATED WITH
HEREDITARY RETINAL DEGENERATION
Refsum Disease (Phytanoyl-CoA
Hydroxylase Deficiency)

11

Autosomal recessive RP (often without bone
spicules) with increased serum phytanic acid
level. May have cerebellar ataxia, peripheral
neuropathy, deafness, dry skin, anosmia, liver
disease, and cardiac abnormalities. Treat with
low-phytanic acid, low-phytol diet (minimize
the amount of milk products, animal fats, and
green leafy vegetables). Check serum phytanic
acid levels every 6 months.

Hereditary Abetalipoproteinemia
(Bassen–Kornzweig Syndrome)
Autosomal recessive RP (usually without bone
spicules) with fat intolerance, diarrhea, crenated erythrocytes (acanthocytes), ataxia, progressive restriction of ocular motility, and other
neurologic symptoms as a result of deficiency
in lipoproteins and malabsorption of the fatsoluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K). Diagnosis
based on serum apolipoprotein-B deficiency.

LWBK1000-C11_p293-357.indd 342

Group of autosomal recessive retinal dystrophies that represent the most common genetic
cause of congenital blindness in children. Fundus appearance is variable, but typically shows
a pigmentary retinopathy. Moderate-to-severe
vision loss identified at or within a few months
of birth, infantile nystagmus, poor and/or
paradoxic papillary response, photophobia,
oculodigital sign (eye poking), and markedly
reduced or flat ERG. Associated with keratoconus. Gene therapy targeting the RPE65 gene
has shown success in human trials.

Usher Syndrome
Multiple subtypes exist, all autosomal recessive. Associated with congenital sensorineural
hearing loss which is usually stable throughout adult life. Genes involved code a protein
complex present in inner ear hair cells and
retinal photoreceptor cells. Molecular testing
for certain subtypes is available.

Bardet–Biedl Complex
Mainly autosomal recessive group of different
diseases with similar findings including pigmentary retinopathy, hypogonadism, obesity,
polydactyly, mental retardation, and others.
Lawrence–Moon syndrome is a related but
separate entity associated with spastic paraplegia, but without the polydactyly and obesity.

Kearns–Sayre Syndrome

age 20 years. Mitochondrial inheritance. Refer
the patient to a cardiologist for yearly ECGs.
Patients may need a pacemaker. See 10.12,
Chronic Progressive External Ophthalmoplegia.

Other RP Syndromes
 Spielmeyer–Vogt–Batten–Mayou syndrome:

Associated with seizures, dementia, and
ataxia.
 Alström, Cockayne, and Alport syndromes:

Associated with hearing loss.
 Zellweger syndrome: Associated with hypo-

tonia, hypertelorism, and hepatomegaly.
 Others: Incontinentia pigmenti, Jansky–

Bielschowsky, etc.

Differential Diagnosis
 Phenothiazine toxicity

—Thioridazine
Pigment clumps between the posterior pole
and the equator, areas of retinal depigmentation, retinal edema, visual field abnormalities (central scotoma and general constriction), depressed or extinguished ERG.
Symptoms and signs may occur within
weeks of starting phenothiazine therapy,
particularly if very large doses (≥2,000 mg/
day) are taken. Usually, more than 800 mg/
day chronically needed for toxicity. Discontinue if toxicity develops. Follow every
6 months.

343

 Congenital rubella: A salt-and-pepper fun-

dus appearance may be accompanied by
microphthalmos, cataract, deafness, a
congenital heart abnormality, or another
systemic abnormality. The ERG is usually
normal.
 Bietti

crystalline dystrophy: Autosomal recessive condition characterized by
crystals of unknown composition in the
peripheral corneal stroma and in the retina
at different layers. Can cause choroidal
atrophy, decreased night vision, decreased
visual acuity, and a flat ERG.

 After resolution of a serous RD: e.g., tox-

emia of pregnancy or Harada disease. The
history is diagnostic.
 Pigmented

paravenous retinochoroidal
atrophy: Paravenous localization of RPE
degeneration and pigment deposition. No
definite hereditary pattern. Variable visual
fields and ERG (usually normal).

 After severe blunt trauma: Usually due to

spontaneous resolution of RD.
 After ophthalmic artery occlusion.
 Carriers

of ocular albinism: See 13.8,

Albinism.

NOTE: The pigment abnormalities are at the
level of the RPE with phenothiazine toxicity,
syphilis, and congenital rubella. With resolved
RD, the pigment is intraretinal.

—Chlorpromazine
Abnormal pigmentation of the eyelids,
cornea, conjunctiva (especially within the
palpebral fissure), and anterior lens capsule;
anterior and posterior subcapsular cataract;
rarely, a pigmentary retinopathy within the
visual field and ERG changes described for
thioridazine. Usually, 1,200 to 2,400 mg/
day for longer than 12 months needed for
toxicity. Discontinue if toxicity develops.
Follow every 6 months.
 Syphilis:

Positive FTA-ABS, asymmetric
visual fields, abnormal fundus appearance,
may have a history of recurrent uveitis, no
family history of RP; the ERG is usually preserved to some degree.

the diseases discussed previously.
2. Drug history.
3. Family history with pedigree and genetic
testing for diagnostic and counseling purposes (see above).

7. Fundus photographs.
8. Consider FTA-ABS.
9. If the patient is male and the type of inheritance is unknown, examine his mother
and perform an ERG on her. Women carriers of X-linked disease often have abnormal pigmentation in the mid-periphery
and abnormal results on dark-adapted
ERGs.
10. If neurologic abnormalities such as ataxia,
polyneuropathy, deafness, or anosmia are
present, obtain a fasting (at least 14 hours)
serum phytanic acid level to rule out Refsum disease.
11. If hereditary abetalipoproteinemia is suspected, obtain serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels (levels are low), a serum
protein and lipoprotein electrophoresis
(lipoprotein deficiency is detected), and
peripheral blood smears (acanthocytosis is
seen).
12. If Kearns–Sayre syndrome is suspected, the
patient must be examined by a cardiologist with sequential ECGs; patients can die
of complete heart block. All family members should be evaluated.

Treatment

11

For syphilis, see 12.12, Syphilis. For vitamin A
deficiency, see 13.7, Vitamin A Deficiency.
No definitive treatment for RP is currently
known. However, vitamin A palmitate, 15,000
IU, has been shown to slow the reduction of
ERG. This very controversial treatment (which
showed no visual benefits) is considered only
for nonpregnant patients ≥21 years of age.
Monitor liver function test results and vitamin A levels.
Cataract surgery may improve central
visual acuity. Topical or oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (e.g., acetazolamide 500 mg/
day) may be effective for CME.
All patients benefit from genetic counseling and instruction on how to deal with their
visual handicaps. Tinted lenses may provide
comfort outdoors and may provide better
contrast enhancement. In advanced cases,
low-vision aids and vocational rehabilitation
are helpful.

HEREDITARY CHORIORETINAL DYSTROPHIES
AND OTHER CAUSES OF NYCTALOPIA
(NIGHT BLINDNESS)
 Gyrate atrophy: Nyctalopia and decreased

peripheral vision usually presenting in the
first decade of life, followed by progressive
constriction of visual field. Scalloped RPE and
choriocapillaris atrophy in the mid-periphery
during childhood that coalesces to involve
the entire fundus, posterior subcapsular cataract, high myopia with astigmatism. Constriction of visual fields and abnormal to
nonrecordable ERG. Plasma ornithine level
is 10 to 20 times normal; lysine is decreased.
Consider ERG and IVFA if the ornithine
level is not markedly increased. Autosomal
recessive.

Treatment
1. Reduce dietary protein consumption and
substitute artificially flavored solutions
of essential amino acids without arginine
(e.g., arginine-restricted diet). Monitor serum
ammonia levels.
2. Supplemental vitamin B6 (pyridoxine).
The dose is not currently established;
consider 20 mg/day p.o. initially and
increase up to 500 mg/day p.o. if there is
no response. Follow serum ornithine levels
to determine the amount of supplemental
vitamin B6 and the degree to which dietary
protein needs to be restricted. Serum ornithine levels between 0.15 and 0.2 mmol/L
are optimal.

NOTE: Only a small percentage of patients are
vitamin B6 responders.

 Choroideremia: Males present in the first
to second decade of life with nyctalopia,
followed by insidious loss of peripheral
vision. Decreased central vision occurs late.
In males, early findings include dispersed
pigment granules in the periphery with
focal areas of RPE atrophy. Late findings
include total absence of RPE and choriocapillaris. No bone spicules. Retinal arteriolar narrowing and optic atrophy can

occur late in the process; constriction of
visual fields, normal color vision, markedly
reduced ERG. Female carriers have small,
scattered, square intraretinal pigment
granules overlying choroidal atrophy, most
marked in the mid-periphery. No effective
treatment for this condition is currently
available. Darkly tinted sunglasses may
ameliorate symptoms. X-linked recessive.
Consider genetic counseling.
 Vitamin A deficiency: Marked night
blindness; numerous small, yellowwhite, well-demarcated spots deep in the
retina seen peripherally; dry eye and/
or Bitôt spots (white keratinized lesions)
on the conjunctiva. See 13.7, Vitamin A
Deficiency.

 Zinc deficiency: May cause abnormal
dark adaptation (zinc is needed for vitamin A metabolism).
 Congenital stationary night blindness: Night blindness from birth, normal visual fields, may have a normal or
abnormal fundus, not progressive. Paradoxic pupillary response. One variant
is Oguchi disease, characterized by the
Mizuo phenomenon—the fundus has a
tapetum appearance in the light-adapted
state, but appears normally colored when
dark- adapted (takes about 12 hours) (see
Figures 11.28.3 and 11.28.4).

Inheritance
Usually sporadic. Hereditary forms are usually
autosomal dominant, or less often X- linked.

Differential Diagnosis
 Stargardt disease: Especially in an early

stage when the fundus flavimaculatus is
absent and ERG may be normal. See 11.30,
Stargardt Disease (Fundus Flavimaculatus).
 Chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine

maculopathy: May produce a bull’s-eye macular
appearance and poor color vision. History
of medication use, no family history of cone
degeneration, no nystagmus. See 11.32,
Chloroquine/Hydroxychloroquine Toxicity.

 Central areolar choroidal dystrophy: Geo-

graphic atrophy of the RPE with normal
photopic ERG.
 ARMD: Can have geographic atrophy of

the RPE, but with normal color vision and
photopic ERG. See 11.16, Nonexudative

ophthalmoscopic examination, IVFA, OCT,
ERG, and EOG. Patients can often be tricked
into seeing better by special testing. See 10.25,
Nonphysiologic Visual Loss.

Work-Up
1. Family history.
2. Complete ophthalmic examination, including color plates and formal color testing
(e.g., Farnsworth–Munsell 100-hue test, red
test object for chloroquine).
3. Formal visual field test.
4. ERG.
5. IVFA to help detect the bull’s-eye macular
pattern.
6. Fundus autofluorescence can be useful in
the diagnosis (particularly sensitive to disturbances in the RPE), as well as for monitoring these diseases.

Treatment
There is no proven cure for this disease. The
following measures may be palliative:
1. Heavily tinted glasses or contact lenses may
help maximize vision.
2. Miotic drops (e.g., pilocarpine 0.5% to 1%
q.i.d.) are occasionally tried to improve
vision and reduce photophobia.
3. Genetic counseling.
4. Low-vision aids as needed.

Follow-Up
Yearly.

STARGARDT DISEASE
(FUNDUS FLAVIMACULATUS)

Symptoms
Decreased vision in childhood or young
adulthood. Early in the disease, the decrease
in vision is often out of proportion to the
clinical ophthalmoscopic appearance; there-

Any of the following may be pres-

 A relatively normal-appearing fundus except

for a heavily pigmented RPE.
 Yellow or yellow-white, flecklike deposits at

the level of the RPE, usually in a pisciform
(fish-tail) configuration.
 Atrophic macular degeneration: May have

a bull’s-eye appearance as a result of atrophy of the RPE around a normal central
core of RPE, a “beaten-metal” appearance,
pigment clumping, or marked geographic
atrophy.
NOTE: In early stages, vision declines before visible macular changes develop.

Other. Atrophy of the RPE just outside of the
macula or in the mid-peripheral fundus, normal peripheral visual fields in most cases, and
rarely an accompanying cone or rod dystrophy. The ERG is typically normal in the early
stages, but may become abnormal late in the
disease. The EOG can be subnormal.

Inheritance
Usually autosomal recessive, but occasionally
autosomal dominant.

Differential Diagnosis
 Fundus albipunctatus: Diffuse, small, white,

discrete dots, most prominent in the midperipheral fundus and rarely present in
the fovea; congenital stationary night
blindness variant; no atrophic macular degeneration or pigmentary changes. Visual
acuity and visual fields remain normal.
Prolonged dark-adaptation time with normal ERG.

 Retinitis punctata albescens: Similar clini-

cal appearance to fundus albipunctatus,
but visual acuity, visual field, and night
blindness progressively worsen. A markedly
abnormal ERG develops. Variant of RP.
 Drusen: Small, yellow-white spots deep

 Batten disease and Spielmeyer–Vogt syn-

drome: May have bull’s-eye maculopathy,
autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disease, progressive dementia, seizures; may
have variable degree of optic atrophy, attenuation of retinal vasculature, and peripheral

1. History: Age at onset, medications, family
history?
2. Dilated fundus examination.
3. IVFA often shows blockage of choroidal fluorescence producing a “silent choroid” or
“midnight fundus” as a result of increased
lipofuscin in the RPE cells.
4. Fundus autofluorescence can be helpful in
diagnosis and in monitoring disease progression.
5. ERG and EOG.
6. Formal visual field examination (e.g., Octopus, Humphrey).
7. Consider genetic testing: Sequencing of
the ABCA4 gene (found to be abnormal in
many cases of Stargardt disease and other
related maculopathies).

Treatment
Ultraviolet light-blocking glasses when outdoors may be beneficial. Low-vision aids,
services dedicated to helping the visually
handicapped, and genetic counseling are
helpful.

BEST DISEASE (VITELLIFORM MACULAR
DYSTROPHY)

Symptoms
Decreased vision or asymptomatic.

Signs
(See Figure 11.31.1.)
Critical. Yellow, round, subretinal lesion(s)
likened to an egg yolk (lipofuscin) or in some
cases to a pseudohypopyon. Typically bilateral
and located in the fovea, measuring approximately one to two disc areas in size. Likely
present at birth, though may not be detected
until examination is performed. Ten percent
of lesions are multiple and extrafoveal. ERG is
normal and EOG is abnormal, showing severe
loss of the light response.

Chloroquine/Hydroxychloroquine Toxicity

Other. The lesions may degenerate, and
patients may develop macular CNV (20% of
patients), hemorrhage, and scarring. In the
scar stage, it may be indistinguishable from
ARMD. May be hyperopic and have esophoria
or esotropia.

Inheritance
Autosomal dominant with variable penetrance and expression. Carriers may have normal fundi but an abnormal EOG.

Differential Diagnosis
 Pattern dystrophy: A type of pattern dystro-

phy, adult-onset foveomacular dystrophy,
can mimic Best disease. The egg-yolk lesions
are usually smaller, appearing from ages 30
to 50 years. The condition is dominantly
inherited, and the EOG may or may not be
abnormal. Visual acuity is usually normal
or slightly decreased until the sixth decade
of life, when central vision may be compromised by geographic atrophy. There is no
effective treatment for this entity.
 ARMD: See above and 11.16, Nonexuda-

tive (Dry) Age-Related Macular Degeneration.

Work-Up
1. Family history. It is often helpful to examine family members.

11.32

349

2. Complete ocular examination, including a
dilated retinal examination, carefully inspecting the macula with a slit lamp and a fundus
contact, or handheld (60-, 78-, 90-diopter)
lens.
3. EOG is highly specific and can be used to
confirm the diagnosis or to detect the carrier state of the disease.
4. Consider IVFA and OCT to detect the presence of or to delineate a CNV.

Treatment
There is no effective treatment for the underlying disease. Treatment for CNV is controversial because it may heal without devastating visual loss. Laser should be considered for
well-defined CNV outside the foveal center.
Subfoveal CNV treatment options include
PDT and intravitreal anti-VEGF agents. See
11.17, Neovascular or Exudative (Wet) AgeRelated Macular Degeneration, for detailed
treatment options for CNV.

Follow-Up
Patients with CNV should be treated
promptly. Otherwise, there is no urgency in
seeing patients with this disease. Patients are
given an Amsler grid (see Appendix 4, Amsler
Grid), instructed on its use, and told to return
immediately if a change is noted.

and normal dark adaptation. Whorl-like corneal changes also may be observed.

Signs

Dosage Usually Required to Produce Toxicity

Critical. Bull’s-eye macula (a ring of depigmentation surrounded by a ring of increased
pigmentation), loss of the foveal reflex.

Chloroquine: More than 300 g total cumulative dose.

Symptoms

Other. Increased pigmentation in the macula,
arteriolar narrowing, vascular sheathing, peripheral pigmentation, decreased color vision, visual
field abnormalities (central, paracentral, or

Hydroxychloroquine: Toxicity much less common than with chloroquine. Typically more
than 400 mg/day taken over months to years,
with a cumulative dose of 1,000 g, though this
is highly weight dependent.

Differential Diagnosis of Bull’s-Eye Maculopathy
 Cone dystrophy: Family history, usually

<30 years of age, severe photophobia, abnormal to nonrecordable photopic ERG.
See 11.29, Cone Dystrophies.
 Stargardt disease: Family history, usually

<25 years of age, may have white-yellow
flecks in the posterior pole and mid-periphery. See 11.30, Stargardt Disease (Fundus
Flavimaculatus).
 ARMD: Drusen; pigment clumping and atro-

phy and detachment of the RPE or sensory
retina may or may not occur. See 11.16, Nonexudative (Dry) Age-Related Macular Degeneration, and 11.17, Neovascular or Exudative
(Wet) Age-Related Macular Degeneration.
 Batten disease and Spielmeyer–Vogt syn-

drome: Pigmentary retinopathy, seizures,
ataxia, and progressive dementia. See 11.30,
Stargardt Disease (Fundus Flavimaculatus).

Treatment
Discontinue the medication if signs of toxicity
develop.

Baseline Work-Up
Baseline evaluation should be performed
within the 1st year of starting the medication.
1. Best corrected visual acuity.

11

2. Ophthalmoscopic examination, including
dilated fundus exam with particular attention to any pigmentary alterations.
3. Consider posterior pole fundus photographs.
4. Visual field, preferably automated with a
white target and 10-2 protocol.
5. Objective testing with multifocal ERG,
fundus autofluorescence (FAF), or spectral

11.33

domain-OCT (SD-OCT) should be considered at baseline where available, but should
be performed if any of the above screening
tests are abnormal (see Figure 11.32.1).

Follow-Up
After the baseline examination, annual
screening with multifocal ERG, FAF, or SDOCT should begin after 5 years of medication
use. These tests should be acquired sooner if
any concern for toxicity exists or patients are
at high risk.
NOTE: Once ocular toxicity develops, it usually does
not regress even if the drug is withdrawn. In fact,
new toxic effects may develop, and old ones may
progress even after the chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine has been discontinued.

also occur. Skin may reveal evidence of intravenous drug abuse.

Differential Diagnosis
 Hard exudates: Intraretinal lipid exudates

as can be seen in multiple conditions
(e.g., diabetic retinopathy, Coats, retinal
telangiectasia, retinal arterial macroaneurysm). Hard exudates are not seen within
retinal vessels.
 Calcific drusen: Seen in dry ARMD. Drusen

are subretinal, not intravascular.

Etiology
 Canthaxanthin

toxicity: Oral tanning
agent causing ring-shaped deposits in the
superficial retina. Generally asymptomatic
and usually resolves over many years when
the drug is stopped. Usually requires a total
of 19 g over 2 years.

 Tamoxifen: Used in patients with hor-

mone receptor-positive breast cancer. Toxicity usually requires 7.7 g total. Crystals
appear in the inner retina usually around
the macula and may cause ME. Vision
may improve with discontinuation of
drug, but crystals remain. Asymptomatic
patients taking tamoxifen do not need to
be screened. Consider medication change
if evidence of toxicity in consultation
with patient’s oncologist.
 Retinal arterial emboli: Seen within vessel.

See 11.6, Central Retinal Artery Occlusion,
and 11.7, Branch Retinal Artery Occlusion.
 Talc: Red-yellow refractile particles seen

intravascularly in intravenous drug users.
 Methoxyflurane: An anesthetic agent. Tox-

icity especially seen in patients with renal
insufficiency.
 Bietti crystalline dystrophy: Crystals of

unknown composition in the peripheral
corneal stroma and in the retina at different layers. See 11.28, Retinitis Pigmentosa
and Inherited Chorioretinal Dystrophies.

exudation and deposition of intraretinal
crystals which may be Mueller foot plates
or calcium or cholesterol deposits. Patients
can develop ME and/or CNV. Vascular damage is very similar to that seen in diabetic
retinopathy, and some patients with this
condition are later found to have insulin
resistance.

Work-Up
1. History: intravenous drug use? Cardiovascular risk factors such as HTN, elevated
cholesterol? Breast cancer? Use of oral
tanning agents? History of anesthesia in
patient with renal failure?
2. Complete ocular examination, including dilated retinal examination with a slit
lamp and a 60- or 90-diopter lens and indirect ophthalmoscopy carefully examining
for the location, depth, color, and morphology of crystals as well as the presence
of ME, neovascularization of the disc, or
retinal infarction. Carefully examine retinal periphery for evidence of neovascularization. Carefully examine the cornea for
crystals.
3. Consider carotid Doppler US and echocardiography in older patients and those with
cardiovascular risk factors.
4. Examine patient for evidence of intravenous drug abuse.
5. Consider testing for diabetes if idiopathic
juxtafoveal/parafoveal telangiectasis suspected.

6. IVFA may be helpful to demonstrate areas
of nonperfusion distal to an intravascular
crystal.

Treatment
1. Stop tamoxifen or canthaxanthin use if
responsible for toxicity.
2. Stop intravenous drug use.
3. If cholesterol, calcium, or fibrin-platelet
emboli, see 10.20, Transient Visual Loss/

OPTIC PIT

Symptoms
Asymptomatic if isolated. May notice distortion of straight lines or edges, blurred vision,
a blind spot, or micropsia if a serous macular
detachment develops.

Signs
(See Figure 11.34.1.)
Critical. Small, round depression (usually
gray, yellow, or black in appearance) in the
nerve tissue of the optic disc. Most are temporal,
approximately one-third are central, but may be
present anywhere on the nerve head.
Other. Peripapillary atrophy, white or gray
membrane overlying pit, rarely RAPD, various
visual field defects. May develop a localized
detachment of the sensory retina or retinoschisis extending from the disc to the macula,
often associated with subretinal precipitates,
usually unilateral.

Differential Diagnosis

 Acquired pit (pseudopit): Sometimes seen

in patients with low-tension glaucoma or

primary open-angle glaucoma. See 9.1,
Primary Open-Angle Glaucoma.
 Other causes of a serous macular detachment.

See 11.15, Central Serous Chorioretinopathy.

Work-Up
1. Complete ophthalmologic examination
including slit-lamp examination of the optic
nerve and macula with a fundus contact
lens or 60- or 90-diopter lens to evaluate for
a serous macular detachment and CNV.
2. Measure IOP.
3. Obtain baseline automated visual field
testing.
4. If a serous macular detachment is present, consider OCT or an IVFA to rule out a
CNV.

Treatment
1. Isolated optic pit: No treatment required.
2. Optic pit with a serous macular detachment: Laser photocoagulation to the temporal margin of the optic disc is used in
most cases. Vitrectomy with intravitreal
gas may be used in refractory cases.

Follow-Up
1. Isolated optic pits: Yearly examination including IOP check, dilated fundus examination,
and visual field testing if indicated; sooner
if symptomatic. Patients should be given an
Amsler grid. See Appendix 4, Amsler Grid.

FIGURE 11.34.1. Optic pit with associated serous
macular detachment.

late finding is a red, sharply demarcated, cystlike lesion in the fovea.
Other. Visual acuity usually ranges from
20/25 to 20/100. Amsler grid testing may
reveal central or paracentral scotoma. Resolution of acute findings within several weeks
may leave a variable appearance to the fovea
(e.g., pigmentary disturbance, lamellar hole,

Etiology
Unprotected solar eclipse viewing, sungazing
(e.g., related to religious rituals, psychiatric
illnesses, hallucinogenic drugs), sunbathing,
vocational exposure (e.g., aviation, military
service, astronomy).

Work-Up
1. History: Eclipse viewing or sungazing?
Work exposure?
2. Complete ocular examination, including
a dilated fundus examination and careful
inspection of the macula with a slit lamp
and a fundus contact, or handheld (60-,

3. Amsler grid testing may identify central or
paracentral scotomata.
4. IVFA typically shows a window defect late
in the disease course.
5. OCT findings in the acute setting include
hyporeflectivity at the level of the RPE
and occasional hyperreflectivity of the
injured neurosensory retina. In the
chronic stage, a central hyporeflective
defect at the level of the photoreceptor
inner segment–outer segment junction is
seen (see Figure 11.35.2).

Signs

become more prominent with age and can
appear as hard cuticular drusen or soft drusen.
RPE atrophy, hyperplasia, and detachment
can occur. Rarely, overlying orange pigment
(lipofuscin) or subretinal fluid is detected.
Minimal growth of <1 mm over many years
can be found. If >1 mm growth over shorter
period (1 year), then transformation into melanoma should be considered.

Critical. Flat or minimally elevated pigmented or nonpigmented choroidal lesion.
Other. Usually <2 mm thick with gradual
elevation from the choroid. Overlying drusen

Risk Factors for Malignant Transformation
These are remembered by mnemonic “To Find
Small Ocular Melanoma” whereby the first
letter of each word (TFSOM) represents a risk
factor.
 T: Thickness >2 mm.
 F: Fluid (subretinal).
 S: Symptoms (typically flashes or floaters).
 O: Orange pigment over the lesion.
 M: Margin of tumor ≤3 mm from the optic

disc.
NOTE: If three or more factors are present, the
lesion has a >50% chance to show growth and is
likely to be a small choroidal melanoma.

Work-Up
1. Complete ophthalmologic examination
including dilated fundus examination with
evaluation of the lesion using a 20-diopter
lens.
2. Detailed clinical drawing of the lesion with
careful attention to location and size.
3. Baseline color photos of the lesion to assist
in documenting growth.
4. OCT to document the overlying retinal features, subretinal fluid, and the lesion itself
using enhanced-depth imaging.
5. Autofluorescence to document the presence of lipofuscin or retinal pigment epithelial disturbance.
6. US for tumor thickness measurement and
internal acoustic qualities.

Treatment
Observation. First examination should be in 3
to 4 months to confirm stability, then one to
two times yearly to document lack of change.

Follow-Up
Low-risk lesions can be followed with annual
dilated fundus examination. High-risk lesions
should be followed every 3 to 6 months.

Differential Diagnosis of Pigmented Lesions
 Choroidal nevus: See above.
 Congenital hypertrophy of the RPE: Flat

black lesions that have crisp margins and
often occur in the peripheral fundus. The
margins are often well delineated with a
surrounding depigmented and pigmented
halo. Depigmented lacunae within the
lesion appear as the lesion ages. Asymptomatic (see Figure 11.36.3).
 Reactive hyperplasia of the RPE: Related to

previous trauma or inflammation. Lesions
are black, flat, have irregular margins, and

eral. Patient may have a history of cancer
(especially breast or lung cancer).
 Choroidal osteoma: Yellow-orange, usu-

ally close to the optic disc, pseudopod-like
projections of the margin, often bilateral, typically occurs in young women in
their teens or twenties. US may show a
minimally elevated, calcified plaque-like
lesion.
 Posterior scleritis: Patients may have cho-

FIGURE 11.36.3. Congenital hypertrophy of the
retinal pigment epithelium.

 Subretinal blood: From any cause can sim-

ulate a melanoma, including ARMD, IPCV,
PEHCR, others. IVFA and ICG may aid in
differentiation. See specific sections.
 Melanocytoma of the optic nerve: A black

optic nerve lesion with fibrillated margins.
It can grow slowly in approximately 15%
cases. IVFA may allow differentiation.
 Choroidal

11

detachment: Follows ocular
surgery, trauma, or hypotony of another
etiology. Dark peripheral multilobular
fundus mass. The ora serrata is often visible without scleral depression. Localized
suprachoroidal hemorrhage can be very
difficult to differentiate from melanoma
based on appearance alone. Transillumination is helpful with serous detachment but
is not helpful when there is a hemorrhagic
component in distinguishing these entities from melanoma. In these situations,
IVFA is the study of choice, usually allowing differentiation between the two entities. See 11.27, Choroidal Effusion/Detachment.

Differential Diagnosis of
Nonpigmented Lesions
 Choroidal hemangioma: Red-orange, may

be elevated, not mushroom shaped.
 Metastatic

carcinoma: Cream or light
brown, flat or slightly elevated, extensive
subretinal fluid, may be multifocal or bilat-

roidal folds, pain, proptosis, uveitis, or
anterior scleritis associated with an amelanotic mass. Look for the T-sign on US. See
5.7, Scleritis.
 Lymphoma: Yellow-orange infiltration; can

be unilateral or bilateral; often there is associated orbital or conjunctival lymphoma.
 Sclerochoroidal calcification: Asymptom-

atic, yellow-white, sub-RPE and sub-choroidal plaques. Typically bilateral and commonly postequatorial and superotemporal.
May be elevated. May be the result of calcification of the insertion of the oblique
muscles. B scan US shows an elevated,
calcified lesion. Typically idiopathic and
seen in elderly patients. Can be associated
with abnormalities of calcium-phosphorus
metabolism and cases of renal tubular hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis (e.g., Gitelman
and Bartter syndromes). Renal function,
and serum electrolytes including calcium
and magnesium should be checked.

Work-Up
1. History: Ocular surgery or trauma, cancer,
anorexia, weight loss, or systemic illness?
2. Dilated fundus examination using indirect
ophthalmoscopy.
3. IVFA: May rule out lesions that simulate
melanoma, but may not differentiate melanoma from large nevus, metastases, or
hemangioma.
4. A- and B-scan US: Documents thickness
and confirms clinical impression. With
choroidal melanoma, US usually shows
low-to-moderate reflectivity with choroidal excavation. Thickness is often >2 mm.
May show a mushroom appearance.

Choroidal Nevus and Malignant Melanoma of the Choroid

5. OCT: Often documents fresh subretinal
fluid.
6. Autofluorescence: Often shows prominent
overlying lipofuscin (orange pigment).
7. ICG angiography: Can show double circulation with prominent blood vessels
within the melanoma.
8. Consider fine-needle aspiration biopsy in
selected cases for cytologic confirmation
and genetic analysis of the tumor for prognostication.
9. Consider CT scan or MRI of the orbit and
brain (useful in patients with opaque
media).
10. If melanoma is confirmed:
—Blood work: lactate dehydrogenase,
gamma-glutamyl transferase, aspartate and
alanine aminotransferases, and alkaline
phosphatase twice yearly. If liver enzymes
are elevated, consider an MRI or liver scan
to rule out a liver metastasis.
—Annual chest radiograph or chest computed tomography.

357

—Annual MRI of the liver.
—Complete physical examination by a
medical internist.
11. Referral to an internist or oncologist for
breast examination, full skin examination,
chest radiograph, and consider a carcinoembryonic antigen assay if a choroidal
metastasis is suspected.

Treatment
Depending on the results of the metastatic
work-up, the tumor characteristics, the status of the contralateral eye, and the age and
general health of the patient, melanoma of
the choroid may be managed by observation, photocoagulation, transpupillary thermotherapy, radiation therapy, local resection, enucleation, or exenteration. Most
cases are managed with plaque radiotherapy
followed by consolidation of the scar with
thermotherapy. Methods to protect from
ultimate vision loss from radiation retinopathy include anti-VEGF medications and sector photocoagulation.

Uveitis
ANTERIOR UVEITIS (IRITIS/IRIDOCYCLITIS)

Symptoms
 Acute: Pain, redness, photophobia, con-

sensual photophobia (pain in the affected
eye when a light is shone in the fellow eye),
excessive tearing, decreased vision.
 Chronic: Decreased vision [from vitreous

debris, cystoid macular edema (CME), or
cataract]. May have periods of exacerbations and remissions with few acute symptoms [e.g., juvenile idiopathic (rheumatoid)
arthritis (JIA/JRA)].

Signs
Critical. Cells and flare in the anterior chamber, ciliary flush, keratic precipitates (KP):
 Fine KP (“stellate”; typically covers entire

corneal endothelium): Herpetic, Fuchs heterochromic iridocyclitis (FHIC), cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis, and others.

disease, infectious endophthalmitis, rifabutin,
tumor), iris nodules (sarcoidosis, syphilis, tuberculosis), iris atrophy (herpetic), iris heterochromia (FHIC), iris synechiae (especially HLA-B27,
sarcoidosis), band keratopathy (especially JIA in
younger patients, any chronic uveitis in older),
uveitis in a “quiet eye” (consider JIA, FHIC, masquerade syndromes), CME (see Figure 12.1.1).

Differential Diagnosis
 Posterior uveitis with spillover into the

anterior chamber: Mainly floaters and
decreased vision, positive fundoscopic findings (see 12.3, Posterior Uveitis).
 Traumatic iritis. See 3.5, Traumatic Iritis.
 Posner–Schlossman syndrome: Recurrent

episodes of very high IOP and minimal
inflammation. See 9.8, Glaucomatocyclitic
Crisis/Posner–Schlossman Syndrome.

 Small,

nongranulomatous KP: Human
leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B27 associated,
trauma, masquerade, JIA, Posner–Schlossman syndrome (glaucomatocyclitic crisis),
and all the granulomatous entities.

 Granulomatous KP [large, greasy (“mutton-

fat”); mostly on inferior cornea]: Sarcoidosis, syphilis, tuberculosis, sympathetic
ophthalmia, lens-induced, Vogt–Koyanagi–
Harada (VKH) syndrome, and others.
Other. Low intraocular pressure (IOP) more
commonly seen (secondary to ciliary body
hyposecretion), elevated IOP can occur (e.g.,

an intraocular lens (particularly a closedloop anterior chamber lens or single-piece
lens in ciliary sulcus). See 9.16, Postoperative
Glaucoma.

 Sclerouveitis: Uveitis secondary to scleritis;

typically presents with profound pain.
 CLARE (contact lens-associated red eye):

Red eye, corneal edema, epithelial defects,
iritis with or without hypopyon, and no
stromal infiltrates.
 Infectious keratouveitis: Corneal infiltrate

is present. See 4.11, Bacterial Keratitis.
 Infectious endophthalmitis: History of recent

surgery or penetrating trauma, pain, hypopyon, fibrin, vitritis, decreased vision, red eye;
may have endogenous source with fever,
elevated white count. See 12.13 to 12.16,
Endophthalmitis sections.
 Schwartz–Matsuo

syndrome:
Pigment
released from a chronic retinal detachment
clogs the trabecular meshwork resulting in
elevated IOP.

 Behçet disease: Young adults, acute hypo-

pyon, iritis, aphthous ulcers, genital ulcerations, erythema nodosum, retinal vasculitis (arteries and/or veins) and hemorrhages,
may have recurrent episodes.
 Lyme disease: May have history of a tick

bite and rash. See 13.3, Lyme Disease.
 Anterior segment ischemia: Flare out of

proportion to cellular reaction. Pain. Secondary to carotid insufficiency, tight scleral
buckle, or previous muscle surgeries.

and asymptomatic with minimal injection.
Often bilateral. Iritis may precede the typical pauciarticular arthritis (four or fewer
joints involved). Positive antinuclear antibody (ANA), negative rheumatoid factor,
and increased erythrocyte sedimentation
rate (ESR) most commonly seen. Associated
with glaucoma, cataracts, band keratopathy, and CME. Uveitis may occur in polyarticular and less frequently in systemic JIA.

 Pseudouveitis from pigment dispersion syn-

dromes. Other findings include krukenburg
spindle and iris transillumination defects.

Etiology
 Idiopathic.
 HLA-B27 associated uveitis: Systemic asso-

ciations include ankylosing spondylitis,
reactive arthritis (Reiter syndrome), psoriatic arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease.

 Chronic iridocyclitis of children: Usually

young girls, similar to JIA except no arthritis.
 FHIC: Few symptoms, diffuse iris stromal

NOTE: Bilateral recurrent alternating anterior
uveitis is very characteristic of HLA-B27 uveitis.
 Lens-induced uveitis: Immune reaction to

lens material, often secondary to incomplete
cataract extraction, trauma with lens capsule damage, or hypermature cataract. See
9.12, Lens-Induced (Phacogenic) Glaucoma.
 Postoperative

iritis: Anterior chamber
inflammation following intraocular surgery.
Endophthalmitis must be considered if
severe inflammation and pain are present.

atrophy often causing a lighter-colored iris
with transillumination defects and blunting of the iris architecture. Gonioscopy may
reveal fine vessels that cross the trabecular meshwork, typically without posterior
synechiae. Fine KP over the entire corneal
endothelium, mild anterior chamber reaction. Vitreous opacities, glaucoma, and
cataracts are common.
 Sarcoidosis:

More common in AfricanAmericans and Scandinavians. Usually bilateral; can have extensive posterior synechiae or
conjunctival nodules. See 12.6, Sarcoidosis.

Uveitis

 Herpes simplex/varicella zoster: Corneal

scars, history of unilateral recurrent red eye,
occasionally history of skin vesicles, associated with decreased corneal sensation,
increased IOP and iris atrophy.

3. A laboratory work-up may be unnecessary
in certain situations:
—First episode of a mild, unilateral, nongranulomatous uveitis with a history and
examination that is not suggestive of systemic disease.

 Syphilis: May have a maculopapular rash,

iris roseola (vascular papules on the iris), and
interstitial keratitis with ghost vessels in late
stages. Inflammation of any ocular structure
may occur. Neurosyphilis can have vitritis
and meningismus. See 12.12, Syphilis.

—Uveitis in the setting of known systemic
disease such as sarcoidosis or the use of medicines known to cause uveitis (e.g., rifabutin).
—Clinical findings are classic for a particular diagnosis (e.g., herpetic keratouveitis,
FHIC, toxoplasmosis).

 Tuberculosis: Positive protein derivative

of tuberculin (PPD), typical chest radiograph findings, occasionally phlyctenular
or interstitial keratitis, sometimes signs of
posterior uveitis. See 12.3, Posterior Uveitis.
 Others: Leprosy, brucellosis, etc.

4. If the uveitis is bilateral, granulomatous, or
recurrent, and the history and examination
are unremarkable, then a nonspecific initial
work-up is conducted:

Work-Up
1. Obtain a thorough history and review of
systems (Tables 12.1.1 and 12.1.2).
NOTE: Autoimmune diseases are less common
in the very young and very old—consider masquerades.
Inflammatory arthritis typically presents with
stiffness in the morning that improves after activity.

2. Complete ocular examination, including an
IOP check, gonioscopy, and a dilated fundus
examination. The vitreous should be evaluated for cells.

confuse the diagnosis. See Table 12.1.3.

may help identify patients at risk of a significant
IOP increase from steroids. Additionally, periocular depot steroids are relatively contraindicated in
patients with scleritis.

3. If there is no improvement on maximal
topical and repository steroids, or if the
uveitis is bilateral and severe, consider systemic steroids, or immunosuppressive therapy. Consider referral to a uveitis specialist
and rheumatologist.

Treatment
1. Cycloplegic (e.g., scopolamine 0.25% b.i.d.
for mild to moderate inflammation; atropine 1% b.i.d. for severe inflammation).

12

2. Topical steroid (prednisolone acetate 1%
one drop q1–6h, depending on the severity,
brand name is better than generic and often
necessary). Most cases of moderate to severe
acute uveitis require q1–2h dosing initially.
Difluprednate 0.05% may allow less frequent
dosing than prednisolone acetate. Consider
FML ophthalmic ointment at night. If the
anterior uveitis is severe, unilateral, and
is not responding to topical steroids, then
consider periocular repository steroids (e.g.,
triamcinolone 20 to 40 mg subtenon injection). See Appendix 10, Technique for Retrobulbar/Subtenon/Subconjunctival Injections.
NOTE: This is an off-label use of medication and
patients must be advised appropriately. A trial of
topical steroids at full strength for several weeks

LWBK1000-C12_p358-393.indd 362

NOTE: Prior to initiating systemic steroids or
periocular depot steroids, it is important to rule
out infectious causes.

4. Treat secondary glaucoma with aqueous
suppressants. Avoid pilocarpine. Glaucoma
may result from:
—Cellular blockage of the trabecular meshwork. See 9.7, Inflammatory Open-Angle
Glaucoma.
—Secondary angle closure from synechiae
formation. See 9.4, Acute Angle-Closure Glaucoma.
—Neovascularization of the iris and angle.
See 9.14, Neovascular Glaucoma.
—Steroid-response. See 9.9, Steroid-Response
Glaucoma.
5. If an exact etiology for the anterior uveitis
is determined, then systemic management
is required.

22/12/11 12:35 AM

12.1

—Ankylosing spondylitis: Often requires
systemic antiinflammatory agents (e.g.,
NSAIDs such as naproxen). Consider cardiology consult (high incidence of cardiomegaly, conduction defects, and aortic
insufficiency), rheumatology consult, and
physical therapy consult.
—Inflammatory bowel disease: Often benefits from systemic steroids, sulfadiazine, or
other immunosuppressive agents. Obtain a
medical or gastrointestinal consult.
—Reactive arthritis (Reiter syndrome): If
urethritis is present, then the patient and
sexual partners are treated for chlamydia
(e.g., azithromycin 1 g, single dose). Obtain
medical and/or rheumatology consult.
—Psoriatic arthritis: Consider a rheumatology and/or dermatology consult.
—Glaucomatocyclitic crisis: See 9.8, Glaucomatocyclitic Crisis/Posner–Schlossman Syndrome.
—Lens-induced uveitis: Usually requires
removal of lens material. See 9.12, LensInduced (Phacogenic) Glaucoma.
—Herpetic uveitis: Herpes simplex typically
requires topical or oral antivirals and steroid drops for corneal disease. Herpetic iridocyclitis benefits from topical steroids and
systemic antiviral medications (e.g., acyclovir/valacyclovir). See 4.15, Herpes Simplex
Virus and 4.16, Herpes Zoster Ophthalmicus/
Varicella Zoster Virus.
—UGH syndrome: See 9.16, Postoperative
Glaucoma.
—Behçet disease: See 12.7, Behçet Disease.
—Lyme disease: See 13.3, Lyme Disease.
—JIA: Steroid dosage is adjusted according to the degree of anterior chamber cells,
not flare. Prolonged cycloplegic therapy
may be required. Consult rheumatology
or pediatrics as systemic steroid therapy or
other systemic immunomdulatory therapy
is often needed. Regular follow up is essential as flares may be asymptomatic but can
cause extensive damage from synechiae,
glaucoma, cystoid macular edema, and
cataract formation.

Anterior Uveitis (Iritis/Iridocyclitis)

363

NOTE: JIA has a high complication rate with cataract surgery. Avoid cataract surgery if possible
until patient is free of inflammation for at least
3 months. An intraocular lens (IOL) may be
placed in select circumstances.

—Chronic iridocyclitis of children: Same
as JIA.
—FHIC: Usually does not respond to or
require steroids (a trial of steroids may
be attempted, but they should be tapered
quickly if there is no response); cycloplegics are rarely necessary.

NOTE: Patients with FHIC usually do well with
cataract surgery, however they may develop a
hyphema.

—Sarcoidosis: See 12.6, Sarcoidosis.
—Syphilis: See 12.12, Syphilis.
—Tuberculosis: Avoid systemic steroids.
Refer the patient to an internist or infectious disease specialist for consideration of
systemic antituberculous treatment.

Follow-Up
1. Every 1 to 7 days in the acute phase, depending on the severity; every 1 to 6 months when
stable.
2. At each visit, the anterior chamber reaction
and IOP should be evaluated.
3. A vitreous and fundus examination should
be performed for all flare-ups, when vision
is affected, or every 3 to 6 months.

12

4. If the anterior chamber reaction has resolved,
then the steroid drops can be slowly tapered
[usually one drop per day every 3 to 7 days
(e.g., q.i.d. for 1 week, then t.i.d. for 1 week,
then b.i.d. for 1 week)]. Steroids are usually
discontinued following the taper when the
anterior chamber does not have any cellular reaction (flare may still be present).
Rarely, long-term low-dose steroids every
day or every other day are required to keep
the inflammation from recurring. Punctal
occlusion techniques may increase potency
of drug and decrease systemic absorption.

The cycloplegic agents also can be tapered
as the anterior chamber reaction improves.
Cycloplegics should be used at least every
evening until the anterior chamber is free of
cells.

12.2

NOTE: As with most ocular and systemic diseases
requiring steroid therapy, the steroid should be
tapered. Sudden discontinuation of steroids can
lead to severe rebound inflammation.

INTERMEDIATE UVEITIS

Symptoms

Etiology

Painless floaters and decreased vision. Minimal photophobia or external inflammation.
Usually, 15 to 40 years of age and bilateral.

 Idiopathic pars planitis (>70%).

Signs
(See Figure 12.2.1.)
Critical. Vitreous cells, white exudative
material over the inferior ora serrata and pars
plana (snowbank), cellular aggregates floating
predominantly in the inferior vitreous (snowballs). Younger patients may present with vitreous hemorrhage.
NOTE: Snowbanking is typically in the inferior vitreous and can often be seen only with indirect ophthalmoscopy and scleral depression.

Other. Peripheral retinal vascular sheathing,
peripheral neovascularization, mild anterior
chamber inflammation, CME, posterior subcapsular cataract, band keratopathy, secondary glaucoma, epiretinal membrane, and exudative retinal detachment.

 Sarcoidosis. See 12.6, Sarcoidosis.
 Multiple sclerosis. See 10.14, Optic Neuritis.
 Lyme disease. See 13.3, Lyme Disease.
 Syphilis. See 12.12, Syphilis.
 Toxocariasis. See 12.3, Posterior Uveitis, and

8.1, Leukocoria.
 Others: Inflammatory bowel disease, Bar-

tonella, Whipple syndrome, primary Sjogrens syndrome, lymphoma, tubulointerstitial
nephritis uveitis (TINU) syndrome, etc.

Work-Up
1. Chest radiograph, PPD, ACE level, RPR,
FTA-ABS.
2. Consider intravenous fluorescein angiography (IVFA) and/or optical coherence
tomography (OCT) to document CME or
retinal vasculitis.
3. Consider lab testing for Lyme disease, toxoplasmosis, cat-scratch disease. In older individuals, consider work-up for malignancy/
lymphoma.

12

4. Consider magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
of the brain with gadolinium to evaluate for
demyelinating lesions if review of systems is
positive for current or previous focal neurologic deficits. Refer to neurologist for multiple sclerosis work-up if necessary.

Treatment

FIGURE 12.2.1. Pars planitis/intermediate uveitis

with snowballs.

LWBK1000-C12_p358-393.indd 364

Treat all vision-threatening complications in
symptomatic patients with active disease. Mild
vitreous cell in the absence of symptoms or
vision loss may be observed.

22/12/11 12:35 AM

12.3

1. Topical prednisolone acetate 1% or difluprednate 0.05% q1–2h, and consider simultaneous
subtenon steroid (0.5 to 1.0 mL of triamcinolone
40 mg/mL). Repeat the injections every 6 to
8 weeks until the vision and CME have stabilized. Slowly taper the frequency of injections. Subtenon steroid injections must be
used with extreme caution in patients with
steroid-responsive glaucoma. See Appendix
10, Technique for Retrobulbar/Subtenon/Subconjunctival Injections.
2. If no improvement after three injections,
consider systemic steroids (e.g., prednisone
40 to 60 mg p.o. q.d. for 4 to 6 weeks), tapering gradually according to the patient’s
response. Systemic steroid therapy should
be no longer than 3 months, including
taper. Other options include slow release
steroid implants (dexamethasone 0.7 mg
intravitreal implant, and fluocinolone acetonide 0.59 mg intravitreal implant), and
immunomodulatory therapy, often in conjunction with Rheumatology.
NOTE: In bilateral cases, systemic steroid therapy
is often preferred to periocular injections.

Posterior Uveitis

365

vitreous opacification, tractional retinal
detachment, epiretinal membrane, and other
complications. Additionally, vitreous biopsy
through a pars plana vitrectomy may be indicated in cases of suspected masquerade syndromes, particularly, intraocular lymphoma.
NOTE:
1. Some physicians delay steroid injections for
several weeks to observe whether the IOP
increases on topical steroids (steroid response).
If a steroid response is found, depot injections
should be avoided.
2. Topical NSAIDs (e.g., ketorolac q.i.d.) may be
added in patients with CME.
3. Cataracts are a frequent complication of intermediate uveitis. If cataract extraction is performed, the patient should ideally be free of
inflammation for 3 months. Consider starting
the patient on oral prednisone 60 mg daily
5 days prior to surgery and tapering the prednisone over the next month. Consider a combined pars plana vitrectomy at the time of
cataract surgery if significant vitreous opacification is present.

3. Transscleral cryotherapy to the area of
snowbanking should be considered in
patients who fail to respond to either oral
or subtenon corticosteroids.

Follow-Up

4. Pars plana vitrectomy may be useful in cases
refractory to systemic steroids or to treat

2. In the chronic phase, reexamination is performed every 3 to 6 months.

12.3

POSTERIOR UVEITIS

Symptoms
Blurred vision and floaters. Pain, redness, and
photophobia are typically absent unless anterior chamber inflammation is present.
NOTE: Posterior uveitis with significant pain suggests bacterial endophthalmitis or posterior scleritis.

Differential Diagnosis
Panuveitis
Describes a pattern of severe, diffuse inflammation of both anterior and posterior segments. Often bilateral. Possible etiologies are
listed below:
 Sarcoidosis: See 12.6, Sarcoidosis.
 Syphilis: See 12.12, Syphilis.
 VKH syndrome: See 12.11, Vogt–Koyanagi–

Harada Syndrome.

Uveitis

 Behçet disease: See 12.1, Anterior Uveitis

(Iritis/Iridocyclitis), and 12.7, Behçet Disease.
 Lens-induced uveitis: See 9.12, Lens-Induced

(Phacogenic) Glaucoma.
 Sympathetic ophthalmia: See 12.18, Sympa-

thetic Ophthalmia.
 Tuberculosis: Produces varied clinical mani-

festations. The diagnosis is usually made by
ancillary laboratory tests. Miliary tuberculosis may produce multifocal, small, yellow-white choroidal lesions. Most patients
have concomitant anterior granulomatous
or nongranulomatous uveitis.
Postsurgical/Trauma
See 12.13, Postoperative Endophthalmitis; 12.14,
Chronic Postoperative Uveitis; 12.15, Traumatic
Endophthalmitis; and 12.18, Sympathetic Ophthalmia.
Choroiditis

 Punctate

inner choroidopathy: Blurred
vision, paracentral scotoma, and/or photopsias, usually in young myopic women. Multiple, small round yellow–white spots predominantly in posterior pole with minimal
intraocular inflammation. Lesions become
well-demarcated atrophic scars within weeks.
CNV may develop in up to 40% of patients.

 Serpiginous choroidopathy: Typically bilat-

eral, recurrent chorioretinitis characterized
by acute lesions (yellow–white subretinal
patches with indistinct margins) bordering old atrophic scars. The chorioretinal
changes usually extend from the optic disc
outward; however, one-third may begin
peripherally. Patients are typically aged
30 to 60 years. Strongly consider systemic
immunosuppression. CNV may develop.

 Acute posterior multifocal placoid pigment

 Toxocariasis: Typically unilateral. Usually

epitheliopathy (APMPPE): Acute visual loss in
young adults, often after a viral illness. Multiple, creamy yellow–white, plaque-like subretinal lesions in both eyes. Lesions block
early and stain late on IVFA. Usually spontaneously improves. Rarely associated with a
cerebral vasculitis.

occurs in children. The most common presentations are a macular granuloma (elevated
white retinal/subretinal lesion) with poor
vision, unilateral pars planitis with peripheral
granuloma, or endophthalmitis. A peripheral lesion may be associated with a fibrous
band extending to the optic disc, sometimes
resulting in macular vessel dragging. A severe
vitritis and anterior uveitis may be present.
A negative undiluted Toxocara titer in an
immunocompetent host usually rules out
this disease. See 8.1, Leukocoria.

 Birdshot

so patients should return for urgent evaluation if they have decreased vision or metamorphopsia.

retinochoroidopathy:
Usually middle-aged, with bilateral, multiple,
creamy-yellow spots deep to the retina,
approximately 1 mm in diameter, scattered
throughout the fundus. A mild to moderate vitritis is present. Retinal or optic nerve
edema or both may be present. Positive
HLA-A29 in approximately 90% of patients.
Consider systemic immunosuppression.

 Multifocal

choroiditis: Visual loss in
young myopic women, typically bilateral.
Multiple, small, round, pale inflammatory lesions (similar to histoplasmosis) are
located at the level of the pigment epithelium and choriocapillaris. Unlike histoplasmosis, vitritis occurs in 98% of patients. The
lesions are predominantly in the macula
and frequently respond to oral or periocular steroids, but typically recur. Choroidal
neovascularization (CNV) is common, and

LWBK1000-C12_p358-393.indd 366

 Presumed ocular histoplasmosis syndrome:

Punched-out chorioretinal scars, peripapillary atrophy, and often CNV. Vitreous
cells are absent. See 11.24, Ocular Histoplasmosis.
Retinitis
 Multiple evanescent white-dot syndrome:
Photopsias and acute unilateral visual loss,
often after a viral illness, usually in young
women. Uncommonly bilateral or sequential. Multiple, small, creamy white lesions
deep in the retina or at the level of the
retinal pigment epithelium with foveal
granularity and occasionally vitreous cells.
There is often an enlarged blind spot on for-

mal visual field testing. May have a shimmering scotoma. Vision typically returns to
normal within weeks without treatment.
 CMV: Whitish patches of necrotic retina

are mixed with retinal hemorrhage. Seen
in neonates and immunocompromised
patients. See 12.9, Cytomegalovirus Retinitis.
 Acute retinal necrosis (ARN): Unilateral or

bilateral peripheral white patches of thickened necrotic retina with vascular sheathing that progress rapidly. A significant
vitritis is typically present. See 12.8, Acute
Retinal Necrosis.
 Progressive outer retinal necrosis (PORN):

Clinically similar to ARN, but may not have
vitreous cells and involves the posterior
pole early. Often in immunocompromised
patients. See 12.8, Acute Retinal Necrosis.
 Toxoplasmosis: Retinal lesion associated

with a pigmented chorioretinal scar. Focal
dense vitritis. See 12.5, Toxoplasmosis.
 Candida: Early discrete drusen-like choroi-

dal lesions progressing to yellow–white,
fluffy retinal or preretinal lesions. See 12.17,
Candida Retinitis/Uveitis/Endophthalmitis.
Vasculitis
Retinal sheathing around vessels. Branch retinal
vein and branch retinal artery occlusions may
occur.
 Periphlebitis (predominantly veins).

—Sarcoidosis: Yellow “candlewax” exudates around veins.
—Syphilis.

 Both arteries and veins.

—Systemic lupus erythematosus.
—Wegener granulomatosis.
—Behçet disease.
—HLA-B27-associated.
Other Infectious Causes of Posterior Uveitis
 Cat-scratch disease: Stellate macular exudates,
optic nerve swelling, vitreous cells, positive
Bartonella serology. See 5.3, Parinaud Oculoglandular Conjunctivitis.
 Diffuse unilateral subacute neuroretinitis:

Typically unilateral visual loss in children
and young adults, caused by a nematode.
Optic nerve swelling, vitreous cells, and
deep gray–white retinal lesions are present
initially, but may be subtle. Later, optic atrophy, narrowing of retinal vessels, and atrophic pigment epithelial changes develop.
Vision, visual fields, and ERG deteriorate
with time. Treatment is to laser nematode.
 Lyme disease: Produces varied forms of pos-

terior uveitis. See 13.3, Lyme Disease.
 Nocardia, Coccidioides species, Aspergillus

species, Cryptococcus species, meningococcus, ophthalmomyiasis, onchocerciasis, and
cysticercosis (seen more commonly in Africa
and Central and South America).

—Pars planitis: Most prominent in the
inferior periphery, NVE may be present.

Other Causes of Vitreous Cells

—Eales disease: Peripheral neovascularization and/or avascular retina.

—Birdshot retinochoroidopathy.

—Large cell lymphoma (reticulum cell sarcoma): Persistent vitreous cells in patients
>50 years, which usually do not respond
completely to systemic steroids. Yellow–
white subretinal infiltrates, retinal edema
and hemorrhage, anterior chamber inflammation, or neurologic signs may be present.

 Arteritis (predominantly arteries).

—Giant cell arteritis.
—Polyarteritis nodosum.
—Frosted branch angiitis.

Uveitis

—Malignant melanoma: A retinal detachment and associated vitritis may obscure the
underlying tumor. See 11.36, Choroidal Nevus
and Malignant Melanoma of the Choroid.
—Retinitis pigmentosa: Vitreous cells and
macular edema may accompany waxy pallor of the optic disc, “bone-spicule” pigmentary changes, and attenuated retinal
vessels. See 11.28, Retinitis Pigmentosa and
Inherited Chorioretinal Dystrophies.
—Rhegmatogenous retinal detachment
(RRD): A small number of pigmented anterior vitreous and anterior chamber cells
frequently accompany an RRD. See 11.3,
Retinal Detachment.
—Retained intraocular foreign body: Persistent inflammation after a penetrating
ocular injury. May have iris heterochromia.
Diagnosed by indirect ophthalmoscopy,
gonioscopy, B-scan ultrasonography (US),
US biomicroscopy, or computed tomography (CT) scan of the globe. See 3.15, Intraocular Foreign Body.
—Retinoblastoma: Almost always occurs
in young children. May also present with
a pseudohypopyon and vitreous cells. One
or more elevated white retinal lesions are
usually, but not always, present. See 8.1,
Leukocoria.
—Leukemia: Unilateral retinitis and vitritis
may occur in patients already known to
have leukemia.

12

—Amyloidosis: Retrolenticular footplatelike deposits, vitreous globules, or membranes without any signs of anterior
segment inflammation. Serum protein electrophoresis and diagnostic vitrectomy confirm the diagnosis. Rare.
—Asteroid hyalosis: Small, white, refractile
particles (calcium soaps) adherent to collagen fibers and floating in the vitreous. Usually asymptomatic and of no clinical significance.

Work-Up

intravenous (i.v.) drug abuse, indwelling
catheter, risk factors for AIDS? Recent eye
trauma or surgery? Travel to the Ohio–
Mississippi River Valley, Southwestern
United States, New England, or Middle
Atlantic area? Tick bite?
2. Complete ocular examination, including
IOP measurement and careful ophthalmoscopic examination. Indirect ophthalmoscopy with scleral depression of the ora
serrata.
3. Consider IVFA to help in diagnosis or plan
for therapy.
4. Blood tests (any of the following are
obtained, depending on the suspected
diagnosis): Toxoplasma titer, ACE level,
serum lysozyme, FTA-ABS, RPR, ESR, ANA,
HLA-B51 (Behçet disease), HLA-A29 (birdshot retinochoroidopathy), Toxocara titer,
Lyme immunofluorescent assay or ELISA.
In neonates or immunocompromised
patients, consider checking titers for CMV,
herpes simplex, varicella zoster, and rubella
virus. Cultures of blood and i.v. sites may
be helpful when infectious etiologies are
suspected. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
techniques are available for varicella zoster, herpes simplex, Toxoplasma, and other
pathogens.
5. PPD with anergy panel.
6. Chest radiograph.
7. Urine for CMV in immunocompromised
patients.
8. CT/MRI scan of the brain and lumbar
puncture when reticulum cell sarcoma is
suspected and when human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated opportunistic infections indicate a potential for
central nervous system (CNS) involvement.
9. Diagnostic vitrectomy when appropriate
(see individual sections).
See the individual sections for more specific
guidelines for work-up and treatment.

ESR, positive HLA-B27, may have recurrent episodes. Arthritis tends to involve the
lower extremities.
 Psoriatic arthritis: Characteristic skin find-

Signs
Critical. Recurrent, unilateral (or bilateral)
nongranulomatous anterior uveitis.
Other. Severe anterior chamber reaction with
cell, flare, and fibrin. May have hypopyon. Tendency to form posterior synechiae early. Ciliary
flush. More common in men than women.

ings with arthritis typically involving the
upper extremities.

Work-Up
1. HLA-B27 to confirm diagnosis.
2. Ankylosing spondylitis: Sacroiliac spine
radiographs show sclerosis and narrowing
of the joint spaces, ESR.
3. Inflammatory bowel disease: Medicine or
Gastroenterology consult.
4. Reactive arthritis: Conjunctival and urethral swabs for Chlamydia if indicated; a
Medicine or Rheumatology consult.
5. Psoriatic arthritis: A Rheumatology or Dermatology consult.

Treatment

 Ankylosing spondylitis: Young adult men,

often with low back pain or stiffness, abnormalities on sacroiliac spine radiographs,
increased ESR, positive HLA-B27.
 Inflammatory bowel disease: Crohn disease

and ulcerative colitis. Chronic diarrhea.

See 12.1, Anterior Uveitis (Iritis/Iridocyclitis).
Patients with HLA-B27 uveitis often suffer
multiple recurrences. For particularly relapsing cases, consider longer-term steroid sparing
immunomodulatory therapy, often in conjunction with Rheumatology.

Uveitis

1. History: Does the patient eat raw meat or has
the patient been exposed to cats (sources of
acquired infection)? Inquire about risk factors
for HIV in atypical cases (e.g., several active
lesions without old chorioretinal scars).
2. Complete ocular examination, including a
dilated fundus evaluation.

FIGURE 12.5.1. Toxoplasmosis.

 Posterior: Vitreous debris, optic disc swell-

ing often with edema extending into the
retina, neuroretinitis with/without macular
star, optic neuritis with significant vitritis,
retinal vasculitis, rarely retinal artery or
vein occlusion in the area of the inflammation. Kyrieleis arterialitis is periarterial exudate accumulation which may occur near
the retinitis or elsewhere in the retina. Chorioretinal scars are occasionally found in the
uninvolved eye. CME may be present.
NOTE: Toxoplasmosis is the most common cause
of posterior uveitis and accounts for approximately 90% of focal necrotizing retinitis.
Toxoplasmosis can also develop in the deep
retina (punctate outer retinal toxoplasmosis) with
few to no vitreous cells present. More common in
HIV-infected patients. See below.

Differential Diagnosis

12

See 12.3, Posterior Uveitis, for a complete list.
The following rarely may closely simulate
toxoplasmosis.
 Syphilis (See 12.12, Syphilis) and tuberculo-

sis.
 Toxocariasis: Usually affects children. Cho-

rioretinal scars are not typically seen. See
12.3, Posterior Uveitis, and 8.1, Leukocoria.
 Acute retinal necrosis. See 12.8, Acute Reti-

nal Necrosis (see Table 12.8.1).

Work-Up
See 12.3, Posterior Uveitis, for a nonspecific
work-up when the diagnosis is in doubt.

LWBK1000-C12_p358-393.indd 370

3. Serum anti-toxoplasma antibody titer to
indicate previous or current infection (usually not necessary). The high population
seropositivity reduces the positive predictive value of a positive titer, but a negative
titer should give strong consideration to
an alternate diagnosis. Immunoglobulin M
(IgM) is found approximately 2 weeks to 6
months after initial infection, after which
only IgG remains.
NOTE: Request a 1:1 dilution because any titer
of serum antibodies is significant in the setting of
classic fundus findings.

4. Toxoplasmosis antibody titers and PCR
may be performed on anterior chamber
taps or through diagnostic vitrectomy in
equivocal cases.
5. FTA-ABS, PPD, chest radiograph, and a Toxocara ELISA when the diagnosis is uncertain.
6. Consider HIV testing in atypical cases or
high-risk patients. See below.

Treatment
1. Mild peripheral retinochoroiditis.
a. Self-limited in immunocompetent patients. Consider observation only for
extramacular lesions.
b. Treat elevated IOP with antiglaucoma
medications and if anterior chamber
involved use topical cycloplegic (e.g.,
cyclopentolate 1% to 2% t.i.d.) with or
without topical steroid (e.g., prednisolone acetate 1% q.i.d.).
2. Consider treatment for lesions in the macula,
within 2 to 3 mm of the disc, threatening a
large retinal vessel, vitritis severe enough to
cause a two-line decrease in vision, or disease in an immunocompromised patient.
Extended treatment may be required for
patients who are immunocompromised.

22/12/11 12:35 AM

a. Classic first-line therapy (for 4 to 6 weeks):

—Sulfadiazine 2 g p.o. load and then
1 g p.o. q.i.d.
—Prednisone may be added 20 to 60
mg p.o. q.d. beginning at least 24 hours
after initiating antimicrobial therapy and
tapered 10 days before stopping antibiotics. Periocular steroids should not be given.
NOTE: Due to potential bone marrow suppression, a complete blood count (CBC) must
be obtained once per week while a patient
is taking pyrimethamine. If the platelet count
decreases below 100,000, then reduce the
dosage of pyrimethamine and increase the
folinic acid. Patients taking pyrimethamine
should not take vitamins that contain folic
acid. The medication should be given with
meals to reduce anorexia.
Systemic steroids should only rarely be used
in immunocompromised patients. Before systemic steroid use, evaluation of fasting blood
sugar and studies to rule out tuberculosis are
prudent.

Toxoplasmosis

371

—Atovaquone 750 mg p.o. q.i.d., used as
alternative similar to clindamycin.

—Pyrimethamine, 200 mg p.o. load (or
two 100-mg doses p.o. 12 hours apart),
and then 25 to 50 mg p.o. daily. Do not
give pyrimethamine to pregnant or breastfeeding women. (Spiramycin 1 g p.o. t.i.d.
for women who seroconvert in pregnancy.)
—Folinic acid 10 mg p.o. every other
day (to minimize bone marrow toxicity
of pyrimethamine).

•

—Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (160
mg/800 mg) one tablet p.o. b.i.d., with
or without clindamycin and prednisone.
—Azithromycin loading dose 1 g (day 1)
then 250 to 500 mg daily. May be used
alone or in combination with pyrimethamine (50 mg q.d.)
c. Anterior segment inflammation is treated as above.
3. Vitrectomy has been used for nonclearing
dense vitritis or other complications.
4. Maintenance therapy (if patient is immunosuppressed)
—Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole 160 mg/
800 mg one tablet p.o. b.i.d. Recurrences
may be avoided with dosing as infrequently as one tablet every 3 days.
or
—Pyrimethamine 25 to 50 mg p.o. q.d. Sulfadiazine 500 to 1,000 mg p.o. q.i.d. Folinic
acid 10 mg p.o. q.i.d.
—If sulfa-allergic, may use clindamycin
300 mg p.o. q.i.d.
5. Prophylaxis: Prior to cataract or refractive
surgery in a patient with a history of toxoplasmosis consider using trimethoprim/
sulfamethoxazole b.i.d. during the perioperative period.

Follow-Up
b. Alternate regimens:
—Clindamycin 150 to 450 mg p.o. t.i.d.
to q.i.d. (maximum 1.8 g/d) may be used
alone, with pyrimethamine as alternative
therapy (if the patient is sulfa allergic),
or as an adjunct (quadruple therapy) to
previously discussed therapy. Patients on
clindamycin should be warned about pseudomembranous colitis, and the medication
should be stopped if diarrhea develops.
Intravitreal injection of clindamycin (0.1
mg/0.1 mL) can be effective for macular
threatening cases, or when the patient is
intolerant to systemic medication. May
be combined with intravitreal steroid injection (i.e., dexamethasone 400 micrograms).

In 3 to 7 days for blood tests and/or ocular assessment, and then every 1 to 2 weeks on therapy.

SPECIAL CONSIDERATION IN
IMMUNOCOMPROMISED PATIENTS
Vitritis is much less prominent. Adjacent retinochoroidal scars are usually not observed. The
lesions may be single or multifocal, discrete or
diffuse, and unilateral or bilateral. CNS imaging is essential because of high association with
CNS disease (e.g., toxoplasmosis encephalitis
in HIV patients). Diagnostic vitrectomy may be
necessary because of the multiple simulating
entities and the variability of laboratory diagnostic tests. Systemic steroids for ocular toxoplasmosis are contraindicated in AIDS.

SARCOIDOSIS

Symptoms
Bilateral ocular pain, photophobia, and
decreased vision. May have insidious onset,
especially in older patients with chronic disease. Systemic findings may include shortness
of breath, parotid enlargement, fever, arthralgias, and rarely neurologic symptoms. Most
common in 20- to 50-year age group. Most common in African Americans and Scandinavians.

Signs
Critical. Iris nodules, large mutton-fat KP
(especially in a triangular distribution on the
inferior corneal endothelium), sheathing along
peripheral retinal veins (candle-wax drippings),
peripheral retinal neovascularization.
Other. Conjunctival nodules, enlargement of
lacrimal gland, dry eyes, posterior synechiae,
glaucoma, cataract, intermediate uveitis, CME,
vitritis, Dalen–Fuchs nodules (pale choroidal
lesions that may simulate multifocal choroiditis or birdshot retinochoroidopathy), peripheral
retinal neovascularization (see Figure 12.6.1).
Systemic. Tachypnea, facial nerve palsy,
enlargement of salivary or lacrimal glands,
bilateral symmetric hilar adenopathy on
chest radiograph or CT, erythema nodosum
(erythematous, tender nodules beneath the
skin, often found on the shins), lupus pernio

(a dusky purple rash on nose and cheeks),
arthritis, lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly.
NOTE: Uveitis, secondary glaucoma, cataracts, and
macular edema are the most common vision-threatening complications of ocular sarcoidosis.

Differential Diagnosis
 Other causes of mutton-fat KP and iris nod-

ules include syphilis, tuberculosis, sympathetic ophthalmia, and lens-induced uveitis.
See 12.1, Anterior Uveitis (Iritis/Iridocyclitis).
 Intermediate uveitis may be idiopathic or

secondary to sarcoid, multiple sclerosis,
Lyme disease, and others. See 12.2, Intermediate Uveitis.
 Posterior uveitis with multiple chorioretinal

lesions may be from birdshot retinochoroidopathy, intraocular lymphoma, syphilis, sympathetic ophthalmia, multifocal
choroiditis, VKH syndrome, and others. See
12.3, Posterior Uveitis.

Work-Up
The following are the tests that are obtained
when sarcoidosis is suspected clinically. See
12.1, Anterior Uveitis (Iritis/Iridocyclitis), and 12.3,
Posterior Uveitis, for nonspecific uveitis work-up.
Initial work-up:
1. Chest radiography is the single most useful test. Typically shows bilateral and symmetric hilar adenopathy and/or infiltrates
indicative of pulmonary fibrosis. In cases of
unilateral or atypical lung disease, consider
malignancy. Consider chest CT scan if chest
x-ray normal but clinical suspicion high.

12

FIGURE 12.6.1. Sarcoid choroidal granuloma.

LWBK1000-C12_p358-393.indd 372

2. Serum ACE is elevated in 60% to 90% of
patients with active sarcoidosis. Normal
level does not rule out sarcoidosis and elevation is not specific. Leprosy, histoplasmosis, and tuberculosis may also present with
elevated ACE. Patients on oral steroids and
ACE inhibitors (e.g., captopril for hypertension) may have falsely low ACE levels. ACE

22/12/11 12:35 AM

12.6

levels in children are variable and less helpful in diagnosis.
3. PPD with anergy panel: Useful for differentiating tuberculosis from sarcoidosis. Up to
50% of sarcoidosis patients are anergic and
have no response to PPD or controls.
4. Obtain biopsy of accessible affected lesions
to confirm noncaseating granulomatous
inflammation. Sample at the edges of skin
plaques or nodules. Sarcoid granulomas are
not present in erythema nodosum and these
lesions should not be sampled. An acid-fast
stain and a methenamine–silver stain may
be performed to rule out tuberculosis and
fungal infection. A nondirected conjunctival biopsy in the absence of visible lesions
has a low yield and is not recommended.
5. Some authors recommend serum and urine
calcium levels, liver function tests, and a
serum lysozyme. A positive result on one
of these tests in the absence of chest radiographic or other findings is usually not
helpful in diagnosis. A serum lysozyme
may be useful in children, where ACE levels
are unreliable.
If laboratory and chest radiographic studies suggest sarcoidosis or in the setting of a
negative work-up but a high clinical suspicion
of sarcoidosis, the following tests should be
considered:
1. Chest CT scan may be more sensitive than
plain films because of better visualization.
2. Whole-body gallium scan is sensitive for sarcoidosis. A “panda sign” indicates involvement of lacrimal, parotid, and submandibular glands. A “lambda sign” indicates
involvement of perihilar and paratracheal
lymph nodes. A positive gallium scan and
an elevated ACE level is 73% sensitive and
100% specific for sarcoidosis.
3. Referral to pulmonologist for pulmonary
function tests and transbronchial lung biopsy.

Treatment
Consider referring patients to an internist or
pulmonologist for systemic evaluation and
medical management. Consider early referral
to a uveitis specialist in complicated cases. A

poor visual outcome has been reported with
posterior uveitis, glaucoma, delay in definitive
treatment, or presence of macula-threatening
conditions such as CME.
1. Anterior uveitis:
• Cycloplegic (e.g., scopolamine 0.25% t.i.d.).
• Topical steroid (e.g., prednisolone acetate
1% q1–6h).
2. Posterior uveitis:
• Systemic steroids (e.g., prednisone 20 to
100 mg p.o. q.d.) and a histamine type
2 receptor (H2) blocker (e.g., ranitidine
150 mg p.o. b.i.d.) are often required in
the presence of posterior uveitis (including optic neuritis) or bilateral severe
anterior disease.
• Periocular steroids (e.g., triamcinolone
40 mg/mL in 0.5 mL subtenon injection
every 3 to 4 weeks) may be considered
instead of systemic steroids, especially in
unilateral or asymmetric cases. See Appendix 10, Technique for Retrobulbar/Subtenon/
Subconjunctival Injections.
3. Immunosuppressives (e.g., methotrexate, azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, cyclosporine, cyclophosphamide, hydroxychloroquine, infliximab) have been used effectively as steroid-sparing agents.
NOTE: Topical steroids alone are inadequate for
treatment of significant posterior uveitis.

4. Cystoid macular edema: See 11.14, Cystoid
Macular Edema.
5. Glaucoma: See 9.7, Inflammatory Open-Angle
Glaucoma; 9.9, Steroid-Response Glaucoma; 9.4,
Acute Angle-Closure Glaucoma; or 9.14, Neovascular Glaucoma, depending on the etiology of the glaucoma.

Uveitis

Follow-Up
1. Patients are reexamined in 1 to 7 days,
depending on the severity of inflammation. The steroid dosages are adjusted
in accordance with the treatment response.
Slowly taper the steroids and cycloplegic
agent as the inflammation subsides. Monitor
IOP and reevaluate the fundus at each visit.

12.7

2. Patients with quiescent disease are seen
every 3 to 6 months.
3. Patients being treated with steroids are
monitored every 3 to 6 weeks.
4. Poor response to steroid treatment should
prompt a work-up for other causes of uveitis or referral to a subspecialist.

1. Systemic corticosteroids should be started
(prednisone 1 to 2 mg/kg p.o. q.d. with
ranitidine 150 mg p.o. b.i.d.). Steroids have
been shown to delay the onset of blindness
but not to alter the long-term outcome. Prior
to starting steroids it is important to obtain a

ACUTE RETINAL NECROSIS

Symptoms
Blurred vision, floaters, ocular pain, photophobia. Most patients are immunocompetent.

Signs
(See Figure 12.8.1.)
Critical. Focal, well-demarcated areas of retinal whitening (full-thickness necrosis) in the
peripheral retina; rapid, circumferential progression of necrosis which may approach the
posterior pole; occlusive vasculitis and prominent inflammatory reaction in the vitreous and
anterior chamber. The macula is typically spared
early in the disease course.
Other. Anterior chamber reaction; conjunctival injection; scleritis; increased IOP; sheathed
retinal arterioles and sometimes venules, especially in the periphery; retinal hemorrhages
(minor finding); optic disc edema; delayed
RRD occurs in approximately 70% of patients

secondary to large irregular posterior breaks.
Usually begins unilaterally but may involve
second eye in one-third of cases within weeks
to months. An optic neuropathy with disc
edema or pallor sometimes develops.

Etiology
ARN is a clinical syndrome caused by the herpesvirus family: varicella-zoster virus (older
patients), herpes simplex virus (younger
patients), or, rarely, CMV or EBV.

Differential Diagnosis
See 12.3, Posterior Uveitis.
 CMV retinitis (Table 12.8.1).
 PORN: Rapidly progressive retinitis char-

acterized by clear vitreous and sheet-like
opacification deep to normal-looking retinal vessels, and occasional spontaneous vitreous hemorrhage. PORN is usually found
in immunocompromised individuals and
frequently leads to rapid bilateral blindness
due either to the infection itself or to secondary retinal detachment, making prompt
diagnosis and treatment essential. Unlike
ARN, pain and vitritis are minimal and
macular involvement is early in PORN.

2. Complete ocular examination: Evaluate
the anterior chamber and vitreous for cells,
measure the IOP, and perform a dilated
retinal examination using indirect ophthalmoscopy and scleral depression.
3. Consider a CBC with differential, FTAABS and RPR, ESR, toxoplasmosis titers,
PPD, and chest radiograph to rule out
other etiologies.

12

4. Consider HIV testing.
5. Consider anterior chamber paracentesis for

for an enlarged optic nerve in cases of suspected optic nerve dysfunction.
8. CT scan or MRI of the brain and lumbar
puncture if large cell lymphoma, tertiary
syphilis, or encephalitis is suspected.

LWBK1000-C12_p358-393.indd 376

Treatment
NOTE: All patients with ARN should be referred to
a specialist.

1. Prompt inpatient or outpatient treatment.
The goal is to decrease the incidence of the
disease in the fellow eye. Treatment does
not reduce the rate of retinal detachment
in the first eye.
2. Acyclovir, 1,500 mg/m2 of body surface
area/day i.v., in three divided doses for 5 to
14 days (requires dose adjustment for renal
insufficiency) with supplemental intravitreal
injections with foscarnet (1200 micrograms/
0.1 mL) or ganciclovir (2 mg/0.1 mL) given
1–2 times per week. This is then followed
with oral valacyclovir 1 g t.i.d. or acyclovir
(400 to 800 mg five times per day), for up
to 14 weeks from the onset of infection.
Involvement of the second eye typically
starts within 6 weeks of initial infection.
Recent reports suggest that primary treatment with oral antivirals (valacyclovir 1–2
grams t.i.d. to q.i.d., famciclovir 500 mg
t.i.d., or acyclovir 800 mg five times per day)
in conjunction with the above intravitreal
injections, has similar efficacy as intravenous therapy. Stabilization and early regression of retinitis is usually seen within 4 days.
The lesions may progress during the first 48
hours of treatment.

22/12/11 12:35 AM

12.9

3. Topical cycloplegic (e.g., atropine 1% t.i.d.)
and topical steroid (e.g., prednisolone acetate 1% q2–6h) in the presence of anterior
segment inflammation.
4. Consider antiplatelet therapy (e.g., aspirin
81 to 650 mg daily).
5. Systemic steroids may be considered, particularly when the optic nerve is thought
to be involved. Steroids are usually delayed
at least 24 hours after the initiation of antiviral therapy. A typical oral corticosteroid regimen is prednisone 60 to 80 mg/day for 1 to 2
weeks followed by a taper over 2 to 6 weeks.
Subtenon injection of triamcinolone (40 mg/
1 mL) can be considered after adequate loading of antiviral therapy.
6. See 9.7, Inflammatory Open-Angle Glaucoma,
for increased IOP.
7. Consider prophylactic barrier laser photocoagulation posterior to active retinitis to

wall off or prevent subsequent RRD (controversial).
8. Pars plana vitrectomy, with long-acting gas
or silicone oil, is the best way to repair the
associated complex RRD. Proliferative vitreoretinopathy is common.

Follow-Up
1. Patients are seen daily and are examined
every few weeks to months for the following year.
2. A careful fundus evaluation with scleral
depression is performed at each visit to rule
out retinal holes that may lead to a detachment. If the retinitis crosses the margin of
laser demarcation, consider applying additional laser therapy.
3. Pupillary evaluation should be performed,
and optic neuropathy should be considered if the retinopathy does not explain the
amount of visual loss.

CYTOMEGALOVIRUS RETINITIS

CMV is the most frequent ocular opportunistic infection in patients with AIDS, but
is becoming less common. CMV is almost
never seen unless the CD4+ count is <50
cells/mm3. Because active retinitis may be
asymptomatic, patients with CD4+ counts
<0 cells/mm3 should be seen at least every
3 months. May also be seen in other immunocompromised states (e.g., leukemia and
post-transplant).

Progressive retinal atrophy may also indicate active CMV (see Figure 12.9.1).
Other. Minimal inflammation with few to
no aqueous or vitreous cells. Retinal pigment
epithelial (RPE) atrophy and pigment clumping result once the active process resolves.

12

Symptoms
Scotoma or decreased vision in one or both
eyes and floaters. Pain and photophobia are
uncommon. Often asymptomatic.

Signs
Critical.
 Indolent form: Peripheral granular opacities with occasional hemorrhage.
 Fulminant form: Confluent areas of necro-

sis with prominent hemorrhage, starting
along the major retinal vascular arcades.

nation. The goal of treatment is quiescent
retinitis: nonprogressive areas of RPE atrophy with a stable opacified border. Patients
who respond may be switched to oral therapy (e.g., ganciclovir 1,000 mg p.o. t.i.d.
or valganciclovir 900 mg p.o. b.i.d. for 21
days then 900 mg p.o. q.d.). Oral therapy
with valganciclovir [900 mg p.o. b.i.d. for
induction (21 days), followed by 900 mg
p.o. daily for maintenance] is an acceptable alternative to i.v. therapy. Patients
with progression of retinitis despite induction or who have disease that threatens
the macula may benefit from intravitreal
antiviral injections. Patients who cannot
tolerate systemic medications (e.g., myelosuppression) may benefit from insertion
of a ganciclovir vitreal implant. Systemic
therapy may still be necessary to prevent
involvement of the fellow eye.
2. Under the direction of an internist or infectious disease specialist, highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) should be initiated or optimized
3. Macula-sparing RRDs may be treated with
laser demarcation. Pars plana vitrectomy
with silicone oil is indicated for detachments involving the macula.
4. The role of oral ganciclovir prophylaxis
against CMV is controversial.

Follow-Up
1. Ganciclovir resistance (reflected by positive
blood or urine CMV cultures) may occur at
any point during treatment.
2. Almost all patients eventually relapse.
Serial fundus photographs are quite useful. Relapse is defined as recurrent or new
retinitis, movement of opacified border, or
expansion of the atrophic zone.

LWBK1000-C12_p358-393.indd 379

•

Cytomegalovirus Retinitis

379

3. Relapse does not necessarily indicate drug
resistance. Reinduction with the same
medication is the first line of treatment.
Subtherapeutic intraocular drug levels may
occur in patients on maintenance and allow
for relapse.
4. Clinical resistance is defined as persistent or
progressive retinitis despite induction-level
medication for 6 weeks. Laboratory confirmation is possible for ganciclovir resistance
(screen for UL97 mutation).
5. If resistance is recognized, a change in therapy is indicated. Cross-resistance may be a
problem since the three common drugs are
all DNA polymerase inhibitors. Cross-resistance between ganciclovir and cidofovir is
especially common. Ganciclovir–foscarnet
cross-resistance is uncommon.
6. Discontinuation of anti-CMV maintenance
therapy may be considered in selected
patients receiving HAART who have CD4+
counts >100 cells/mm3 for greater than
6 months and completely quiescent CMV
retinitis. In these patients, whose immune
system can control CMV, stopping maintenance therapy may prevent drug toxicity
and drug-resistant organisms.
7. Immune recovery uveitis (IRU): Occurs in
previously immunocompromised patients
(HIV/transplant) with CMV after the CD4+
count or immune system reconstitutes. In
the presence of a functioning immune system, the CMV antigens elicit an inflammatory response that is predominantly posterior (i.e., vitritis, papillitis, cystoid macular
edema). Treatment may require topical,
periocular, or intraocular steroids. Antivirals
should be continued to avoid reactivation of
CMV in cases of borderline CD4+ counts.

Treatment

1. Topical steroids (e.g., prednisolone acetate

2. Systemic steroids (e.g., prednisone 60 to
80 mg p.o. q.d.) and a histamine blocker
(e.g., ranitidine 150 mg p.o. b.i.d.).
3. Topical cycloplegic (e.g., scopolamine 0.25%
t.i.d.).

1. Initial management may require hospitalization.
2. Weekly, then monthly reexamination is
performed, watching for recurrent inflammation and increased IOP.
3. Steroids are tapered very slowly and most
patients should be transitioned to steroidsparing immunosuppressants for long-term
management. Inflammation may recur up
to 9 months after the steroids have been
discontinued. If this occurs, steroids should
be reinstituted.

1. Complete ophthalmic examination, including pupillary and dilated fundus examination.
2. VDRL and RPR reflect the activity of the disease and are important in monitoring the
patient's response to treatment. Used for
screening, but many false-negative results
can occur in early primary, latent, or late
syphilis. Not as specific.
3. FTA-ABS and treponema pallidum microhemagglutination assay (MHA-TP) are very
sensitive and specific in all stages of syphilis. They are the tests of choice in suspected
ocular syphilis. Once reactive, these tests
do not normalize and cannot be used to
assess the patient’s response to treatment.
4. HIV testing is indicated in any patient with
syphilis because of the relatively aggressive
course in HIV-infected individuals as well
as the frequency of co-infection.
5. Patients should be evaluated for concomitant sexually transmitted diseases, with
notification sent to the local health department when indicated.
6. Lumbar puncture is controversial. We consider lumbar puncture in the following
clinical situations:
—Positive FTA-ABS and neurological or
neuro-ophthalmological signs, papillitis,
active chorioretinitis, or anterior or posterior uveitis.
—HIV and FTA-ABS positive patients.
—Treatment failure.
—Treatment with a nonpenicillin regimen
(as a baseline).

—If a previous VDRL titer greater than or
equal to four times the current titer can
be documented, no treatment is indicated
(unless 5 years have passed and the titer
is still >1:4).
—If a previous VDRL titer was at least 1:8
and did not decrease fourfold, treatment
is indicated.
—If the previous VDRL titer was <1:8,
treatment is not indicated, unless the
current titer has increased fourfold.
—If a previous VDRL is unavailable, treatment is not required unless treatment was
>5 years earlier and the VDRL is still >1:4.
NOTE:
1. If active syphilitic signs (e.g., active chorioretinitis, papillitis) are present despite
appropriate past treatment (regardless
of the VDRL titer), lumbar puncture and
treatment may be needed.
2. Patients with concurrent HIV and active
syphilis may have negative serologies (FTAABS, RPR) because of their immunocompromised state. These patients manifest
aggressive, recalcitrant syphilis and should
be treated with neurosyphilis dosages over
longer treatment periods. Consultation
with infectious disease is recommended.

CSF VDRL on lumbar puncture): Aqueous
crystalline penicillin G 2 to 4 million U i.v.
q4h for 10 to 14 days, followed by benzathine penicillin 2.4 million U intramuscularly (i.m.) weekly for 3 weeks (1.2 million
U in each buttock).
2. Syphilis with abnormal ocular but normal
CSF findings: Benzathine penicillin 2.4 million U i.m. weekly for 3 weeks. Some experts
believe that any retinal or optic nerve
involvement be considered as neurosyphilis
and treated accordingly.
3. If anterior segment inflammation is present, treatment with a cycloplegic (e.g.,
cyclopentolate 2% t.i.d.) and topical steroid
(e.g., prednisolone acetate 1% q.i.d.) may
be beneficial.
NOTE:
1. Treatment for chlamydial infection with a single dose of azithromycin 1 g p.o. is typically
indicated.
2. Therapy for penicillin-allergic patients is not
well established and should be managed in
consultation with an infectious disease specialist. Ceftriaxone 2 g i.v./i.m. for 10 to 14
days is usually the first-choice alternative, but
is contraindicated with severe allergy. Tetracycline 500 mg p.o. q.i.d. for 30 days is used by
some for both late syphilis and neurosyphilis.
Some believe that using penicillin is critical in
neurosyphilis and merits ICU admission and
desensitization in penicillin-allergic patients.

12

12.13

Follow-Up
1. Neurosyphilis: Repeat lumbar puncture
every 6 months for 2 years, less frequently
if the cell count returns to normal sooner.
The cell count should decrease to a normal level within this period, and the CSF
VDRL titer should decrease fourfold within
6 to 12 months. An increased CSF protein
decreases more slowly. If these indices do
not decrease as expected, retreatment may
be indicated.
2. Other forms of syphilis: Repeat the
VDRL titer at 3 and 6 months after treatment. If a VDRL titer of 1:8 or more does
not decline fourfold within 6 months,
if the VDRL titer increases fourfold at
any point, or if clinical symptoms or
signs of syphilis persist or recur, lumbar
puncture and retreatment are indicated.
If a pretreatment VDRL titer is <1:8,
retreatment is indicated only when the
titer increases when signs of syphilis recur.

Congenital Syphilis
Ocular signs include bilateral interstitial keratitis, secondary cataracts, salt-and-pepper chorioretinitis, and iridocyclitis. Hutchinson triad of
congenital syphilis includs peg-shaped widely
spaced incisors, interstitial keratitis, and deafness. Serologic testing is similar to acquired
syphilis above. Standard treatment is with penicillin G, but dosing should be managed by a
pediatrician or infectious disease specialist.

rates of endophthalmitis and may promote
antibiotic resistance.

Gram stain, culture, and sensitivities and
timely intravitreal injections with broadspectrum antibiotics (often vancomycin and

ative infections.

Differential Diagnosis
See 12.14, Chronic Postoperative Uveitis.

Work-Up
1. Complete ocular history and examination. Look for wound/bleb leak, exposed
suture, vitreous to wound, blepharitis,
or other predisposing factors for endophthalmitis.
2. Consider B-scan US if limited view to
posterior segment, which may confirm
marked vitritis and establishes a baseline
against which the success of therapy can
be measured.
3. If vision is light perception or worse, a diagnostic (and therapeutic) vitrectomy is often
indicated. Cultures (blood, chocolate, Sabouraud, thioglycolate) and smears (Gram
and Giemsa stains) are obtained, and intravitreal antibiotics are given. Otherwise, an
anterior chamber paracentesis and vitreous
aspiration of 0.2 mL are usually performed,
although some physicians consider them
nonessential. See Appendix 13, Anterior
Chamber Paracentesis.

Treatment
1. Prevention: Standard practice for prophylaxis of postoperative endophthalmitis

LWBK1000-C12_p358-393.indd 385

5. Atropine 1% t.i.d. to q.i.d.
6. For postcataract endophthalmitis, immediate pars plana vitrectomy is beneficial
if visual acuity on presentation is light
perception. Vitrectomy for other causes of
endophthalmitis (bleb-related, posttraumatic, or endogenous) may be beneficial
in selected cases.

12

7. Systemic antibiotics may be considered.
Intravenous antibiotics are not routinely
used. Consider i.v. fluoroquinolones (e.g.,
moxifloxacin) in special circumstances (e.g.,
bleb-related endophthalmitis or trauma).
Third- and fourth-generation fluoroquinolones may penetrate the vitreous enough
to reach therapeutic levels, especially in
inflamed eyes. Some oral antibiotics (e.g.,
moxifloxacin 400 mg p.o. q.d.) may reach
therapeutic vitreous levels and could be
considered as alternatives to intravenous
antibiotics.

Follow-Up
1. Monitor the clinical course q12h.
2. Relief of pain is a useful early sign of
response to therapy.
3. Consider starting oral steroids (prednisone
60 mg p.o. each morning with ranitidine
150 mg p.o. b.i.d.) in patients who can tolerate steroids.
4. After 48 hours, patients should show
clinical improvement (e.g., relief of pain,
decreased inflammation, decreased hypopyon). Consider reinjecting antibiotics if
no improvement or if Gram stain shows an
unusual organism. Consider vitrectomy if
patient is deteriorating.
5. The antibiotic regimen is refined according
to the treatment response and to the culture and sensitivity results.
6. If the patient is responding well, topical
fortified antibiotics may be slowly tapered
after 48 hours and then switched to regular strength antibiotics (e.g., fluoroquinolone). Close outpatient follow-up is warranted.

SUBACUTE (WEEKS TO MONTHS
AFTER SURGERY)
Symptoms
Variable. Insidious decreased vision, increasing redness and pain.

Signs

Critical. Anterior chamber and vitreous
inflammation, vitreous abscesses, hypopyon;
clumps of exudate in the anterior chamber, on
the iris surface, or along the pupillary border.
Other. Corneal infiltrate and edema; may
have a surgical bleb.

Organisms
 S. epidermidis or other common bacteria

pain. A white plaque or opacities on the
lens capsule may be evident. Only a transient response to steroids.
 Fungi (Aspergillus, Candida, Cephalospo-

rium, Penicillium species; others).

Differential Diagnosis
See 12.14, Chronic Postoperative Uveitis.

Work-Up
1. Complete ocular history and examination.
2. Aspiration of vitreous for smears (Gram,
Giemsa, and methenamine–silver) and cultures (blood, chocolate, Sabouraud, thioglycolate, and a solid medium for anaerobic
culture; P. acnes will be missed unless proper
anaerobic cultures are obtained). See Appendix 11, Intravitreal Tap and Inject. Intravitreal
antibiotics are given as described previously.
See Appendix 12, Intravitreal Antibiotics.
3. Consider CBC with differential, serum electrolytes, liver function tests.

Treatment
1. Initially treat as acute postoperative endophthalmitis, as described previously, but do
not start steroids.
2. Immediate pars plana vitrectomy is beneficial if visual acuity on presentation is light
perception or worse up to 6 weeks after surgery. Benefit beyond 6 weeks is not known.
3. If a fungal infection is suspected or vitreous
smear is consistent with fungus, administer
intravitreal amphotericin B, 5 to 10 mg or
intravitreal voriconazole (50 to 100 mg/0.1
mL) at the time of vitrectomy. If fungus is
identified on Gram stain, Giemsa stain, or
calcofluor white, then consider topical antifungals (e.g., natamycin 5% or voriconazole
1% q1h), and/or systemic antifungal medications until specific organism is known
(consider consulting an infectious disease
specialist for recommendations). Antifungal therapy is modified in accordance with
sensitivity testing, clinical course, and tolerance to antifungal agents.
• A therapeutic vitrectomy should be performed if it was not done with the initial
cultures.

4. Removal of the lens and capsular remnants
may be required for diagnosis and treatment of P. acnes, which may be sensitive to

Follow-Up
1. Dependent on the organism.
2. In general, follow-up is as described previously for acute postoperative endophthalmitis.
3. Repeat CBC, serum electrolytes, and liver
function tests two times per week during
treatment for fungal endophthalmitis.

CHRONIC POSTOPERATIVE UVEITIS

Postoperative inflammation is typically mild,
responds promptly to steroids, and usually
resolves within 6 weeks. Consider the following
etiologies when postoperative inflammation is
atypical.

Etiology
 Severe intraocular inflammation in the

following surgery. Intraocular pressure may
be increased. May be caused by any material placed in the eye during surgery including irrigating or injected solutions (e.g., due
to presence of a preservative or incorrect pH
or concentration of a solution) or improperly cleaned instruments.
 Persistent postoperative inflammation (e.g.,

early postoperative course:

beyond 6 weeks):

—Infectious endophthalmitis: Deteriorating
vision, fibrin in the anterior chamber, vitritis. See 12.13, Postoperative Endophthalmitis.

—Poor compliance with topical steroids.

—Retained lens material: A severe granulomatous inflammation with mutton-fat
keratic precipitates, resulting from an autoimmune reaction to lens protein exposed
during surgery. See 9.12, Lens-Induced
(Phacogenic) Glaucoma.

—Retained lens material.

—Aseptic endophthalmitis: A severe sterile
postoperative uveitis caused by excess tissue
manipulation, especially vitreous manipulation, during surgery. A hypopyon and a mild
vitreous cellular reaction may develop. Usually not characterized by profound or progressive pain or visual loss. Eyelid swelling
and chemosis are atypical. Usually resolves
with topical steroid therapy.
—Toxic anterior segment syndrome: An
acute, sterile inflammation following
uneventful surgery that develops rapidly
within 12 to 24 hours. Characterized by
anterior chamber cell and flare, possibly
with fibrin or hypopyon, and severe corneal
edema in excess of what would be expected

LWBK1000-C12_p358-393.indd 387

387

—Steroid drops tapered too rapidly.

—Iris or vitreous incarceration in the
wound.
—UGH syndrome: Irritation of the iris
or ciliary body by an intraocular lens.
Increased IOP and red blood cells in the
anterior chamber accompany the anterior
segment inflammation. See 9.16, Postoperative Glaucoma.
—Retinal detachment: Often produces a
low-grade anterior chamber reaction. See
11.3, Retinal Detachment.

12

—Low-grade endophthalmitis (e.g., P.
acnes and other indolent bacteria, fungal,
or partially treated bacterial endophthalmitis).
—Epithelial downgrowth: Corneal or conjunctival epithelium grows into the eye
through a corneal wound and may be
seen on the posterior corneal surface. The
iris may appear flattened because of the

Uveitis

spread of the membrane over the anterior
chamber angle onto the iris. Large cells
may be seen in the anterior chamber, and
glaucoma may be present. The diagnosis of
epithelial downgrowth can be confirmed
by observing the immediate appearance of
white spots after medium-power argon laser
treatment to the areas of iris covered by the
membrane.
—Preexisting uveitis: See 12.1, Anterior
Uveitis (Irtitis/Iridocyclitis).
—Sympathetic ophthalmia: Diffuse granulomatous inflammation in both eyes, after
trauma or surgery to one eye. See 12.18,
Sympathetic Ophthalmia.

Work-Up
1. History: Is the patient taking the steroid
drops properly? Did the patient stop the
steroid drops abruptly? Was there a postoperative wound leak allowing epithelial
downgrowth or fibrous ingrowth? Previous
history of uveitis?

12

2. Complete ocular examination of both eyes,
including a slit-lamp assessment of the
anterior chamber reaction, a determination
of whether vitreous or residual lens material is present in the anterior chamber, and
an inspection of the lens capsule looking
for capsular opacities (e.g., P. acnes capsular
plaque). Perform gonioscopy (to evaluate
for iris or vitreous to the wound or small
retained lens fragments), an IOP measurement, a dilated indirect ophthalmoscopic
examination (to rule out retained lens
material in the inferior pars plana, retinal
detachment, or signs of chorioretinitis),
and a posterior vitreous evaluation with a

12.15

3. Obtain B-scan US when the fundus view
is obscured. Consider ultrasound biomicroscopy if available to assess IOL position,
irido-IOL contact for possible UGH syndrome, and to evaluate for retained lens
material.
4. For postoperative endophthalmitis. Anaerobic cultures, using both solid media and
broth, should be obtained to isolate P. acnes
(routine cultures also are obtained; see 12.13,
Postoperative Endophthalmitis). The anaerobic
cultures should be incubated in an anaerobic environment as rapidly as possible and
allowed to grow for at least 2 weeks.
5. Consider an anterior chamber paracentesis for diagnostic smears and cultures. See
Appendix 13, Anterior Chamber Paracentesis.
6. Consider diagnostic medium-power argon
laser treatment to the areas of iris thought
to be covered by epithelial downgrowth.
If this work-up is negative and steroid trial
reduces the inflammation only transiently,
surgery may be required. Consider a limited surgical capsulectomy, vitrectomy, and
injection of intravitreal antibiotics in an
effort to isolate and treat P. acnes. Inflammation, however, often recurs due to persistent
organisms in which case removal of the capsular bag and intraocular lens with reinjection of antibiotics may be required.
See 12.1, Anterior Uveitis (Iritis/Iridocyclitis);
12.3, Posterior Uveitis; 12.13, Postoperative
Endophthalmitis; and 12.18, Sympathetic Ophthalmia for more specific information on
diagnosis and treatment.

p.o. q.d.; and cefazolin 1 g i.v. q8h). Consider an infectious disease consult for guidance in specific cases. May need to adjust
dose for renal insufficiency and for children.
5. Intravitreal antibiotics (e.g., amikacin 0.4 mg

6. The benefit of pars plana vitrectomy is
unknown for traumatic endophthalmitis
without IOFB. However, pars plana vitrectomy reduces infectious and inflammatory
load and provides sufficient material for diagnostic culture and pathologic investigation.

Same as for 12.13, Postoperative Endophthalmitis. Orbital CT scan (axial and coronal views)
with 1-mm cuts and/or B-scan US to evaluate
for IOFB is essential.

Differential Diagnosis
 Endogenous fungal endophthalmitis: May

see fluffy, white vitreous opacities. Organisms
include Aspergillus and Candida. See 12.17,
Candida Retinitis/Uveitis/Endophthalmitis.
 Retinochoroidal infection (e.g., toxoplas-

mosis and toxocariasis): Yellow or white
retinochoroidal lesion present.
 Noninfectious posterior or intermediate uve-

itis (e.g., sarcoidosis, pars planitis). Unlikely
to get the first episode coincidentally during
sepsis.
 Neoplastic conditions (e.g., large cell lym-

phoma and retinoblastoma).

Work-Up
1. History: Duration of symptoms? Underlying disease or infections? Intravenous drug
abuse? Immunocompromised?
2. Complete ocular examination, including a
dilated fundus evaluation.
3. B-scan US if there is no view to the fundus.
4. Complete medical work-up by an Infectious Disease specialist.

12

5. Chest x-ray, cultures of blood, urine, all
indwelling catheters, and i.v. lines, as well as
Gram stain of any discharge. Consider transesophageal or transthoracic echocardiogram
to rule out endocarditis. A lumbar puncture is
indicated when meningeal signs are present.

Treatment
All treatment should be coordinated with a
medical internist.
1. Hospitalize the patient.
2. Broad-spectrum (i.v. and/or oral) antibiotics
are started after appropriate smears and cultures are obtained. Antibiotic choices vary
according to the suspected source of septic
infection (e.g., gastrointestinal tract, genitourinary tract, cardiac) and are determined in
consultation with an infectious disease spe-

LWBK1000-C12_p358-393.indd 390

cialist. Dosages recommended for meningitis
and severe infections are used. If oral antibiotics are used, confirm that the regimen includes
antibiotics with good vitreous penetration.
NOTE: Intravenous drug abusers are given an
aminoglycoside and clindamycin to eradicate
Bacillus cereus.

3. Topical cycloplegic (e.g., atropine 1% t.i.d.).
4. Topical steroid (e.g., prednisolone acetate
1% q1–6h depending on the degree of anterior segment inflammation).
5. Consider intravitreal antibiotics (e.g., amikacin 0.4 mg in 0.1 mL and vancomycin 1 mg
in 0.1 mL; clindamycin 1 mg in 0.1 mL may
be used in place of vancomycin). The timing
of this procedure is controversial. Some vitreoretinal surgeons perform it as soon as possible. Others initially perform aqueous and
vitreous aspirations when the systemic cultures are negative and the organism remains
unknown. Intravitreal antibiotics offer higher
intraocular concentrations. Consider intravitreal antifungal agents, if clinically warranted.
See Appendix 11, Intravitreal Tap and Inject,
and Appendix 12, Intravitreal Antibiotics.
6. Consider pars plana vitrectomy. Vitrectomy
offers the benefit of reducing infective and
inflammatory load and providing sufficient
material for diagnostic culture and pathologic
study. Additionally, intravitreal antibiotics
may be administered at the time of surgery.
7. Periocular antibiotics (e.g., subconjunctival or subtenon injections) are sometimes
used. See Appendix 10, Technique for Retrobulbar/Subtenon/Subconjunctival Injections.

Follow-Up
1. Daily in the hospital.
2. Peak and trough levels for many antibiotic
agents are obtained every few days. Blood
urea nitrogen and creatinine levels are monitored during aminoglycoside therapy. The
antibiotic regimen is guided by the culture
and sensitivity results, as well as the patient's
clinical response to treatment. Intravenous
antibiotics are maintained for at least 2
weeks and until the condition has resolved.

Work-Up

The following should be considered in immunocompromised patients.

1. History: History of bacteremia or fungemia? Underlying medical conditions? Medications? Intravenous drug abuse? Other
risk factors for immunocompromisation?

Herpes viruses; Mycobacterium
avium-intracellulare; Nocardia, Aspergillus,
and Cryptococcus species; coccidioidomycosis, and others.

2. Skin examination for signs of intravenous
drug injection.
3. Complete ocular examination, including
a dilated retinal evaluation. It is recommended that all patients with candidemia
have a baseline fundoscopic examination
(ideally within 72 hours), as ocular involvement may be asymptomatic. A repeat fundoscopic examination is recommended

as above (amphotericin B or voriconazole)
if there is vitreous involvement.
5. Topical cycloplegic agent (e.g., atropine 1%
t.i.d.).
6. See 9.7, Inflammatory Open-Angle Glaucoma,
for IOP control. However, steroids are usually contraindicated in candidiasis.

Follow-Up

2. An infectious disease specialist should be
consulted. Systemic work-up for other sites
of involvement as needed.

1. Patients are seen daily. Visual acuity, IOP,
and the degree of anterior chamber and vitreous inflammation are assessed.

3. Typically, chorioretinitis can be successfully
treated with systemic therapy alone with one
of the following regimens: Fluconazole 400
to 600 mg i.v. or p.o. loading dose followed
by 200 to 400 mg i.v. or p.o. daily. Voriconazole 200 mg i.v. or p.o. twice daily may also

2. Patients receiving -azole antifungals require
liver function tests at least once every other
week and as clinically indicated. Patients
receiving amphotericin require monitoring of electrolytes, creatinine, and CBC as
directed by an infectious disease specialist.

be considered. Caspofungin 70 mg i.v. loading dose followed by 50 mg i.v. daily may also
be considered. Other agents that may be used
include liposomal amphotericin, itraconazole, and micafungin.

Bilateral eye pain, photophobia, decreased
vision (near vision is often affected before
distance vision), red eye. A history of penetrating trauma or intraocular surgery (most
commonly vitreoretinal surgery) to one eye
(usually 4 to 8 weeks before, but the range is
from 5 days to 66 years, with 90% occurring
within 1 year) may be elicited.

Signs
Critical. Suspect any inflammation in the
uninvolved eye after unilateral ocular trauma.
Bilateral severe anterior chamber reaction
with large mutton-fat KP; may have asymmetric involvement with typically more reaction in sympathetic eye. Posterior segment
findings include small depigmented nodules
at the level of the retinal pigment epithelium

LWBK1000-C12_p358-393.indd 392

(Dalen–Fuchs nodules), and thickening of
the uveal tract. Signs of previous injury or
surgery in one eye are usually present.
Other. Nodular infiltration of the iris, peripheral anterior synechiae, neovascularization of
the iris, occlusion and seclusion of the pupil,
cataract, exudative retinal detachment, papillitis. The earliest sign may be loss of accommodation or a mild anterior or posterior uveitis in the uninjured eye.

tuberculosis or sarcoidosis.
5. IVFA or B-scan US, or both, to help confirm
the diagnosis.

Treatment
1. Prevention: Enucleation of a blind, traumatized eye before a sympathetic reaction can
develop (usually considered within 14 days
of the trauma). If sympathetic ophthalmia
develops, the role of enucleation is unclear.
2. Topical steroids (e.g., prednisolone acetate
1% q1–2h). Topical steroids are tapered
slowly as condition improves.

7. Long-term systemic immunosuppression
with corticosteroid sparing agents may be
needed for chronic or relapsing cases.

Follow-Up
1. Every 1 to 7 days initially, to monitor the
effectiveness of therapy and IOP.
2. As the condition improves, the follow-up
interval may be extended to every 3 to
4 weeks.
3. Steroids should be maintained for 3 to
6 months after all signs of inflammation
have resolved and should be tapered slowly.
Because of the possibility of recurrence,
periodic checkups are important.

Problems
ACQUIRED CATARACT

Symptoms

Etiology

Slowly progressive visual loss or blurring, usually over months to years, affecting one or both
eyes. Glare, particularly from oncoming headlights while driving at night, and reduced color
perception may occur, but not to the same
degree as in optic neuropathies. The characteristics of the cataract determine the particular
symptoms.

 Age-related: Most common. Mature, hyper-

Signs
(See Figure 13.1.1.)
Critical. Opacification of the normally clear
crystalline lens.
Other. Blurred view of the retina with dimming of red reflex on retinoscopy. Myopic
shift or the so-called “second sight.” A cataract
alone does not cause a relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD).

mature, and morgagnian.
 Presenile: Diabetes, myotonic dystrophy,

and atopic dermatitis.
 Trauma: Penetrating, concussion (vossius

ring), and electric shock.
 Toxic: Steroids, miotics, antipsychotics (e.g.,

phenothiazines), and others.
 Secondary.

—Chronic anterior uveitis. See 12.1, Anterior Uveitis (Iritis/Iridocyclitis).
—Ionizing radiation.
—Tumor (ciliary body).
—Acute angle-closure glaucoma: Glaucomflecken. See 9.4, Acute Angle-Closure Glaucoma.
—Degenerative ocular disease: Retinitis
pigmentosa, Leber congenital amaurosis,
Gyrate atrophy, Wagner and Stickler syndromes associated with posterior subcapsular cataracts, and others.
 Endocrine/Metabolic.

—Diabetes: Juvenile form characterized by
rapidly progressing white “snowflake” opacities in the anterior and posterior subcapsular
locations. Age-related cataracts form earlier
than in nondiabetics.

FIGURE 13.1.1. Cataract.

—Hypocalcemia: Small, white, iridescent
cortical changes, usually seen in the presence of tetany.

394

LWBK1000-C13_p394-415.indd 394

23/12/11 6:12 AM

13.1

—Wilson disease: Red–brown pigment
deposition in the cortex beneath the anterior capsule (a “sunflower” cataract). See
13.9, Wilson Disease.
—Myotonic dystrophy: Multicolored opacities, “Christmas-tree cataract,” behind the
anterior capsule.
—Others: Down syndrome, Neurofibromatosis Type 2 (posterior subcapsular cataract), etc.

Types
1. Nuclear: Yellow or brown discoloration of
the central lens. Typically blurs distance
vision more than near (myopic shift).
2. Posterior subcapsular: Plaque-like opacity near the posterior aspect of the lens.
Best seen in retroillumination against the
red reflex. Glare and difficulty reading are
common complaints. Associated with ocular inflammation, steroid use, diabetes,
trauma, or radiation. Classically occurs in
patients <50 years of age.
3. Cortical: Radial or spoke-like opacities in the
periphery that expand to involve the anterior
and posterior lens and can cause glare. Often
asymptomatic until central changes develop.
NOTE: A mature cataract is defined as lenticular
changes sufficiently dense to totally obscure the
view of the posterior lens and posterior segment
of the eye. No iris shadow is seen on oblique
illumination at the pupillary margin. Rarely, the
cortex may liquefy and the nucleus becomes
free-floating within the capsule, this is known
as a hypermature or Morgagnian cataract. If the
liquefied cortex leaks through the intact capsule,
wrinkling of the lens capsule may be seen and
phacolytic glaucoma may develop. See 9.12.1,
Phacolytic Glaucoma.

Work-Up
Determine the etiology, whether the cataract
is responsible for the decreased vision, and
whether surgical removal would improve vision.
1. History: Medications? [e.g., tamsulosin or
any medications used for urinary retention (alpha-1 blockers) strongly associated
with intraoperative floppy iris syndrome]

LWBK1000-C13_p394-415.indd 395

•

Acquired Cataract

395

Systemic diseases? Trauma? Ocular disease
or poor vision before the cataract?
2. Complete ocular examination, including
distance and near vision, pupillary examination, and refraction. A dilated slit-lamp
examination using both direct and retroillumination techniques is required to view
the cataract properly. Fundus examination,
concentrating on the macula, is essential in
ruling out other causes of decreased vision.
3. For preoperative planning, note the degree
of pupil dilation, density of the cataract,
and presence or absence of pseudoexfoliation syndrome, phacodonesis (quivering
of the lens indicating zonular damage or
weakness), or cornea guttata.
4. B-scan ultrasonography (US) if the fundus
is obscured to rule out detectable posterior
segment disease.
5. The potential acuity meter (PAM) or laser
interferometry can be used to estimate the
visual potential when cataract extraction
is considered in an eye with posterior segment disease.
NOTE: Laser interferometry and PAM often overestimate the eye’s visual potential in the presence
of macular holes or macular pigment epithelial
detachments. Interferometry also overestimates
results in cases of amblyopia. Near vision is often
the most accurate manner of evaluating macular
function if the cataract is not too dense. Nonetheless, both laser interferometry and PAM are
useful clinical tools.

6. Keratometry readings and an A-scan US
measurement of axial length are required
for determining the power of the desired
intraocular lens (IOL). Corneal pachymetry
or endothelial cell count is occasionally
helpful if cornea guttata are present.

13

Treatment
1. Cataract surgery may be performed for the
following reasons:
—To improve visual function in patients
with symptomatic visual disability.
—As surgical therapy for ocular disease
(e.g., lens-related glaucoma or uveitis).

General Ophthalmic Problems

—To facilitate management of ocular disease
(e.g., to allow a view of the fundus to monitor
or treat diabetic retinopathy or glaucoma).
2. Correct any refractive error if the patient
declines cataract surgery.
3. A trial of mydriasis (e.g., scopolamine
0.25% q.d.) may be used successfully in
some patients who desire nonsurgical treatment. The benefits of this therapy are only

13.2

Follow-Up
Unless there is a secondary complication
from the cataract (e.g., glaucoma), a cataract
itself does not require urgent action. Patients
who decline surgical removal are reexamined
annually, sooner if symptoms worsen.
If congenital, see 8.8, Congenital Cataract.

PREGNANCY

ANTERIOR SEGMENT CHANGES
Transient loss of accommodation and
increased corneal thickness/edema and curvature. Refractive change likely results from a
shift in fluid or hormonal status and will likely
normalize after delivery. Defer prescribing
new glasses until several weeks postpartum.

PREECLAMPSIA/ECLAMPSIA

detachments in 1% of preeclamptic and 10%
of eclamptic patients, acute nonarteritic ischemic optic neuropathy, and bilateral occipital
lobe infarcts (preeclampsia–eclampsia hypertensive posterior encephalopathy syndrome,
or PEHPES). Differential diagnosis of PEHPES
includes posterior circulation stroke, infectious
cerebritis, coagulation disorder causing intracranial venous thrombosis, intracranial hemorrhage, occult tumor with secondary bleed,
migraines, atypical seizure, or demyelination.

A worldwide leading cause of maternal/fetal/
neonatal morbidity and mortality. Occurs in 2%
to 5% of pregnancies but may approach 10% in
developing countries. Occurs after 20 weeks of
gestation; most commonly in primigravids.

Natural History

Symptoms

2. Serous retinal detachments; often bilateral
and bullous; resolve postpartum with residual pigment epithelial changes (see Figure
13.2.1).

Headaches, blurred vision, photopsias, diplopia, and scotomas.

temporary. Most useful for posterior subcapsular cataracts.

1. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) abnormalities resolve 1 to 2 weeks after blood
pressure control, at which time complete
neurologic recovery can be expected.

Systemic
 Preeclampsia or pregnancy-induced hypertension: Hypertension and proteinuria in
previously normotensive women. Other
signs include peripheral edema, liver failure, renal failure, and HELLP syndrome
(hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and
low platelet counts).
 Eclampsia: Preeclampsia with seizures.

Ocular. Focal retinal arteriolar spasm and
narrowing, peripapillary or focal areas of retinal
edema, retinal hemorrhages, exudates, nerve
fiber layer infarcts, vitreous hemorrhage secondary to neovascularization, serous retinal

3. Retinal vascular changes also normalize
postpartum.

Work-Up
1. Complete neuro-ophthalmologic and fundus examinations. Poor vision with brisk
pupils without an RAPD suggests occipital
lesions.
2. MRI findings in PEHPES include bilateral
occipital lobe lesions involving subcortical
white matter with possible extension into
the gray–white junction, cortical surface,
external capsule, and basal ganglia. MRI
abnormalities are identical in obstetric and
nonobstetric hypertensive encephalopathy.
3. With typical presentation, further invasive
studies are discouraged.
4. Systemic work-up, including blood pressure
monitoring and urinalysis, in conjunction
with an OB/GYN specialist.

1. Control blood pressure and electrolyte
imbalances.
2. Prompt delivery ideal.

OCCLUSIVE VASCULAR DISORDERS
Pregnancy represents a hypercoagulable state
possibly resulting in the development of retinal artery and vein occlusions, disseminated

397

intravascular coagulopathy (DIC), and thrombotic thrombocytopenia purpura. Ocular DIC
is characterized by widespread small-vessel
thrombosis, particularly in the choroid, associated with hemorrhage, tissue necrosis, and
serous retinal detachments.

MENINGIOMA OF PREGNANCY
Meningiomas may have a very aggressive growth
pattern during pregnancy that is difficult to
manage. They may regress postpartum but may
reoccur during subsequent pregnancies.
NOTE: All pregnant women complaining of a headache should have their blood pressure, visual fields,
and fundus checked (particularly looking for papilledema). MRI/MRV or lumbar puncture is often
required if a hemorrhage or cortical venous thrombosis is suspected.

Multiple conditions can be impacted by pregnancy. See 3.19, Purtscher Retinopathy; 10.10,
Cavernous Sinus and Associated Syndromes (Multiple Ocular Motor Nerve Palsies); 10.16, Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension/Pseudotumor
Cerebri; 10.27, Migraine; 11.12, Diabetic Retinopathy; and 11.15, Central Serous Chorioretinopathy. Medications deserve special attention
during pregnancy.

LYME DISEASE

Symptoms
Decreased vision, double vision, pain, photophobia, facial weakness. Also may have headache, malaise, fatigue, fever, chills, palpitations,
or muscle or joint pains. A history of a tick bite
within the previous few months may be elicited.

Signs
Ocular. Optic neuritis; vitritis; iritis; stromal
keratitis; choroiditis; exudative retinal detachment; third, fourth, or sixth cranial nerve
palsy; bilateral optic nerve swelling; conjunctivitis; episcleritis; exposure keratopathy;
other rare abnormalities, including idiopathic

Symptoms
Eye discomfort or blurred vision from reading
or near work. Most common in young adults,
but may be seen in older people.

Signs

13

1. Doxycycline 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. for 10 to
21 days.

Critical. An exophoria at near in the presence of poor near-fusional convergence amplitudes, a low accommodative convergence/
accommodation (AC/A) ratio, and a remote
near point of convergence.

AI, but improves clarity in CI. Rarely, adolescents may develop transient paresis of
accommodation, requiring reading glasses or

in several years. Patients with AI may benefit
from reading glasses with base-in prism.
 Convergence paralysis: Acute onset of exotro-

pia and diplopia on near fixation only; normal adduction and accommodation. Usually
results from a lesion in the corpora quadrigemina or the third cranial nerve nucleus, and
may be associated with Parinaud syndrome.

 Glasses inducing a base-out prism effect.
 Post-exanthematous encephalitis.

NOTE: These tests are performed with the patient’s
spectacle correction in place (if glasses are worn for
near work).

 Traumatic injury.

Treatment

 Idiopathic.

1. Correct any refractive error. Slightly undercorrect hyperopia, and fully correct myopia.

Work-Up
1. Manifest (without cycloplegia) refraction.
2. Determine the near point of convergence:
Ask patient to focus on an accommodative target (e.g., a pencil eraser) and to state
when double vision develops as you bring
the target toward them; a normal near
point of convergence is <8 cm.
3. Check for exodeviations or esodeviations at
distance and near using the cover tests (see
Appendix 3, Cover/Uncover and Alternate
Cover Tests) or the Maddox rod test.
4. Measure the patient’s fusional ability at near.
Have patient focus on an accommodative
target at their reading distance. With a prism
bar, slowly increase the amount of baseout prism in front of one eye until patient
notes double vision (the break point), and
then slowly reduce the amount of base-out
prism until a single image is again noted
(the recovery point). A low break point (10
to 15 prism diopters), a low recovery point,
or both, are consistent with CI.
5. Place a 4-diopter base-in prism in front of
one eye while patient is reading. Determine
whether the print becomes clearer or more
blurred to rule out AI.

13.5

2. Near-point exercises (e.g., pencil push-ups):
The patient focuses on a pencil eraser while
slowly moving it from arm’s length toward
the face. Concentrate on maintaining one
image of the eraser, repeating the maneuver when diplopia manifests. Try to bring
the pencil in closer each time while maintaining single vision. Repeat the exercise 15
times, 5 times per day.
3. Near-point exercises with base-out prisms
(for patients whose near point of convergence is satisfactory or for those who
have mastered pencil push-ups without a
prism): The patient performs pencil pushups as described previously, while holding a
6-diopter base-out prism in front of one eye.
4. Encourage good lighting and relaxation
time between periods of close work.
5. For older patients, or those whose condition shows no improvement despite nearpoint exercises, reading glasses with base-in
prism can be useful.

Follow-Up
Nonurgent. Patients are reexamined in 1
month.

ACCOMMODATIVE SPASM

Symptoms

Signs

Bilateral blurred distance vision, fluctuating
vision, blurred vision when shifting gaze from
near to far, headache, and eye strain while
reading. Often seen in teenagers under stress.
Symptoms may occur after prolonged and
intense periods of near work.

Critical. Cycloplegic refraction reveals substantially less myopia (or more hyperopia) than
was originally found when the refraction was
performed without cycloplegia (manifest refraction). Manifest myopia may be as high as 10
diopters. Spasm of the near reflex is associated

1. Complete ophthalmic examination. The
manifest refraction may be highly variable, but it is important to determine the
least amount of minus power or the most
amount of plus power that provides clear
distance vision.
2. Cycloplegic refraction.

Treatment
1. True refractive errors should be corrected. If
a significant amount of esophoria at near is
present, additional plus power (e.g., +2.50
diopters) in reading glasses or bifocal form
may be helpful.
2. Counseling patient and parents to provide a more relaxed atmosphere and avoid
stressful situations.

General Ophthalmic Problems

13.7

VITAMIN A DEFICIENCY

See Table 13.7.1.

Symptoms
Night blindness (earliest and most common
manifestation), dry eyes, ocular pain, and
severe vision loss.

Signs
Ocular: Bitôt spots (triangular, perilimbal,
gray, foamy plaques of keratinized conjunctival
debris); decreased tear breakup time; bilateral
conjunctival and corneal dryness; corneal epithelial defects, sterile or infectious ulceration
(often peripheral with a punched-out appearance), perforation, scarring; keratomalacia
(often preceded by a gastrointestinal, respiratory, or measles infection); fundus abnormalities [yellow or white peripheral retinal dots
representing focal retinal pigment epithelium
(RPE) defects].
Systemic: Growth retardation in children;
dry, hyperkeratotic skin; increased susceptibility to infections.

Differential Diagnosis
See 4.3, Dry-Eye Syndrome, and 11.28, Retinitis
Pigmentosa and Inherited Chorioretinal Dystrophies.

Etiology
 Primary: Dietary deficiency or chronic alco-

holism (relatively uncommon in developed

countries). Beyond 6 months postpartum,
breast milk in vitamin A-deficient mothers
is unlikely to sufficiently maintain vitamin
A stores in nursing infants.
 Secondary: Lipid malabsorption [e.g., cystic

fibrosis, chronic pancreatitis, inflammatory bowel disease, celiac sprue, postgastrectomy or postintestinal bypass surgery,
chronic liver disease, abetalipoproteinemia
(Bassen–Kornzweig syndrome)].

Work-Up
1. History: Malnutrition? Poor or extreme
diet? Gastrointestinal or liver disease? Previous surgery? Measles?
2. Complete ophthalmic examination, including careful inspection of eyelid margins
and inferior fornices.
3. A positive response to treatment is a simple,
cost-effective way to confirm the diagnosis.
4. Consider serum vitamin A level before
treatment is initiated.
5. Consider impression cytology of the conjunctiva, looking for decreased goblet cell
density.
6. Consider dark-adaptation studies and electroretinogram (may be more sensitive than
the serum vitamin A level).

Treatment

4. Consider supplementing the patient’s diet
with zinc and vitamin A.

1. Immediate vitamin A replacement therapy
orally (preferred) or intramuscularly in the
following WHO recommended dosages for
clinical xerophthalmia:
—Children <12 months: 100,000 IU q.d. for
2 days, repeat in 2 weeks.

5. Consider a penetrating keratoplasty or keratoprosthesis for corneal scars in eyes with
potentially good vision.
6. Prophylaxis in endemic regions:
—Infants: consider 50,000 IU.

—Adults and children >12 months: 200,000
IU q.d. for 2 days, repeat in 2 weeks.

—6 to 12 months: 100,000 IU q 4 to 6 months.

—Women of childbearing age (reduce dose
due to possible teratogenic effects): night
blindness or Bitôt spots only, 10,000 IU q.d.
for 2 weeks or 25,000 IU weekly for 4 weeks;
any corneal lesions, give full adult dose as
above.

—Retinyl palmitate has been used to fortify
sugars in developing countries.

2. Intensive ocular lubrication with preservative-free artificial tears every 15 to 60
minutes and preservative-free artificial tear
ointment q.h.s.

A deficiency associated with measles may be
especially severe.

ALBINISM

Signs
Best corrected visual acuity of 20/40 to 20/200;
may have high refractive error; strabismus;
reduced stereopsis; nystagmus starting at age
2 to 3 months; amblyopia secondary to strabismus or anisometropia; iris transillumination defects; retinal hypopigmentation with
highly visible choroidal vasculature; failure
of the retinal vessels to wreathe the fovea; in
true albinism the fovea is hypoplastic, with
no foveal pit or reflex (the only ocular finding
consistently present).
NOTE: Patients with albinism show a wide range
of visual acuities, refractive errors, nystagmus, and
amblyopia.

somal recessive defect in platelet function
leading to easy bruisability and bleeding.
More common in patients of Puerto Rican
descent. Most common gene involved is
HPS-1 on chromosome 10q23.1.
 Chediak–Higashi syndrome: An autosomal

recessive disorder affecting white blood cell
function, resulting in an increased susceptibility to infections and a predisposition for
a lymphoma-like condition. LYST gene on
chromosome 1q42.1-q42.2.

13

Types
1. Oculocutaneous albinism: Autosomal recessive, hypopigmentation of hair, skin, and eye.
• Tyrosinase positive (OCA2): Varying degree
of pigmentation.

General Ophthalmic Problems

• Tyrosinase intermediate (OC1B): No pigmentation at birth. Varying degree of
pigmentation with age.

6. Flash visual evoked potential testing to
demonstrate excessive decussation of retinal ganglion cell axons at the chiasm.

• Tyrosinase negative (OCA1A): No pigmentation.

Treatment

2. Ocular albinism: Only ocular hypopigmentation is clinically apparent. Usually inherited as X-linked recessive (Nettleship–Falls).
Female carriers may have partial iris transillumination and mottled areas of hypopigmentation in peripheral retina. In the autosomal recessive form, females and males are
affected with equal severity.

Work-Up
1. History: Easy bruisability? Frequent nosebleeds? Prolonged bleeding after dental
work? Frequent infections? Family history?
Puerto Rican heritage?
2. External (including hair and skin color)
examination.
3. Complete ocular examination.
4. Before surgery, obtain bleeding time. Platelet aggregation studies and platelet electron
microscopy are also indicated if Hermansky–
Pudlak syndrome is suspected.
5. If Chediak–Higashi syndrome is suspected,
check polymorphonuclear leukocyte function.

13.9

Ocular complaints are rare. Patients experience symptoms of cirrhosis, neurologic disorders, psychiatric problems, or renal disease.
Onset typically between 5 and 40 years of age.

Signs
Critical. Kayser–Fleischer ring: a 1- to 3-mm,
brown, green, or red band that represents copper deposition in the peripheral Descemet
membrane (see Figure 13.9.1). Present in
50% to 60% of patients with isolated hepatic
involvement and more than 90% of patients
with neurologic manifestations. First appears
superiorly (may only be visible on gonioscopy)

LWBK1000-C13_p394-415.indd 404

1. Treating amblyopia may reduce nystagmus,
if present. See 8.7, Amblyopia.
2. Appropriate refraction and early use of bifocals may be necessary as amplitude of accommodation diminishes.
3. Eye muscle surgery may be considered for
patients with significant strabismus or an
abnormal head position due to nystagmus.
However, patients with albinism and strabismus rarely achieve binocularity after
surgical correction.
4. Genetic counseling.
5. Dermatologic consultation. Advise ultraviolet sun protection.
6. Hematology evaluation if either Chediak–Higashi syndrome or Hermansky–
Pudlak syndrome is suspected. Patients
with Hermansky–Pudlak syndrome may
require platelet transfusions before surgery.

There is currently no effective treatment
for albinism, but the following may be helpful:

and eventually forms a ring involving the entire
corneal periphery extending to the limbus. This
autosomal recessive inborn error of metabolism
results in low serum copper and ceruloplasmin
levels with elevated urine copper.
Other. “Sunflower” cataract due to anterior
and posterior subcapsular copper deposition.

Differential Diagnosis
 Kayser–Fleischer-like ring: Seen in primary

biliary cirrhosis, chronic active hepatitis,
progressive intrahepatic cholestasis, and
multiple myeloma. These patients have a
normal serum ceruloplasmin level and no
neurologic symptoms.

4. Referral to an internist or neurologist.

Treatment

FIGURE 13.9.1. Kayser–Fleischer ring in Wilson disease.

1. Lifelong systemic therapy (e.g., zinc, D-penicillamine, trientine) is instituted by an

tion, initially appears inferiorly and superiorly before extending. A clear zone of
cornea separates the edge of the arcus from
the limbus. Check a fasting lipid profile in
patients <40 years.
 Chalcosis: Copper deposition in basement

membranes, including Descemet membrane, secondary to copper-containing
intraocular foreign body. Alloys containing
more than 85% copper may induce severe
inflammation, those with lower amounts
may cause retinal toxicity.

Work-Up
1. Slit-lamp examination: Deposition at Descemet membrane is apparent with a narrow
slit beam.

13.10

Follow-Up
1. Systemic therapy and monitoring with an
internist or neurologist.
2. Successful treatment should lead to resorption of the corneal copper deposition
and clearing of the Kayser–Fleischer ring,
although residual corneal changes may
remain. This change can be used to monitor treatment response. Reappearance of
ring may suggest noncompliance with
treatment.
3. Consider referral of family members for genetic testing for early detection and prevention, specifically defects of the ATP7B gene
on chromosome 13q14.3-q21.1.

 Others: Acquired syphilis, congenital ectopia

lentis, simple ectopia lentis, aniridia, Ehlers–
Danlos syndrome, Crouzon syndrome,
hyperlysinemia, sulfite oxidase deficiency,
high myopia, chronic inflammations, hypermature cataract, etc.

Work-Up
1. History: Family history of the disorders
listed? Trauma? Systemic illness (e.g.,
syphilis)? Neurologic symptoms (e.g., seizures)?
FIGURE 13.10.1. Ectopia lentis.

Etiology
 Trauma: Most common. Results in sub-

luxation if >25% of the zonular fibers are
ruptured. Need to rule out a predisposing
condition (see other etiologies).
 Pseudoexfoliation: Flaky material seen as

scrolls in a “target pattern” on anterior lens
capsule; associated with glaucoma; poor
pupillary dilation; patients at higher risk of
complications during cataract surgery due
to weak zonular fibers (see 9.11, Pseudoexfoliation Syndrome/Exfoliative Glaucoma).
 Marfan syndrome: Bilateral lens sublux-

ation, classically superiorly and temporally,
with increased risk for retinal detachment.
Autosomal dominant with cardiomyopathy, aortic aneurysm, tall stature with long
extremities, and kyphoscoliosis.
 Homocystinuria: Bilateral lens subluxation,

13

classically inferiorly and nasally. Increased
risk of retinal detachment. Autosomal
recessive with frequent mental retardation, skeletal deformities, high incidence of
thromboembolic events (particularly with
general anesthesia). Lens subluxation may
be first manifestation in patients with mild
disease.
 Weill–Marchesani syndrome: Small lens can

dislocate into the anterior chamber, causing reverse pupillary block. Often autosomal recessive with short fingers and stature,
seizures, microspherophakia (small, round
lens), myopia, no mental retardation.

LWBK1000-C13_p394-415.indd 406

2. Complete ocular examination: Determine
whether the condition is unilateral or
bilateral and direction of displacement.
Check for pseudoexfoliation. Evaluation
for subtle phacodonesis by observing the
lens during back and forth eye movement. Evaluate for signs of ocular trauma
including hyphema, angle recession, iridodialysis, cyclodialysis, retinal tears, and
detachments.
3. Systemic examination: Evaluate stature,
extremities, hands, and fingers; often in conjunction with an internist, including sodium
nitroprusside test or urine chromatography
to rule out homocystinuria and echocardiography to rule out aortic aneurysms in
patients with possible Marfan syndrome.
Consider genetic testing when appropriate
and available.
4. RPR and FTA-ABS.

Treatment
1. Lens dislocated into the anterior chamber.
—Dilate the pupil, place the patient on
his or her back, and replace the lens into
the posterior chamber by head manipulation. It may be necessary to indent
the cornea after topical anesthesia with
a Zeiss gonioprism or cotton swab to
reposition the lens. After the lens is repositioned in the posterior chamber, constrict the pupil with pilocarpine 0.5% to
1% q.i.d. and perform a peripheral laser
iridotomy.
or
—Surgically remove the lens (usually performed if a significant cataract is present,

23/12/11 6:12 AM

treatment described previously fails, recurrent
dislocations occur, or there are compliance
issues with pilocarpine) and consider placing an IOL.
2. Lens dislocated into the vitreous.
—Lens capsule intact, patient asymptomatic, no signs of inflammation: Observation
versus pars plana lensectomy and consider
IOL placement.
—Lens capsule broken with intraocular
inflammation: Pars plana lensectomy with
possible IOL placement.

Hypotony Syndrome

4. Pupillary block: Treatment is identical to
that for aphakic pupillary block. See 9.16,
Postoperative Glaucoma.
5. If Marfan syndrome suspected: Refer the
patient to a cardiologist for an annual echocardiogram and management of any cardiacrelated abnormalities. Prophylactic systemic
antibiotics are required if the patient undergoes surgery (or a dental procedure) to prevent endocarditis.
6. If homocystinuria is suspected: Refer to an
internist. The usual therapy consists of:
—Pyridoxine (Vitamin B6) 50 to 1,000 mg
p.o. q.d.

3. Subluxation.
—Asymptomatic: Observe.
—Uncorrectable astigmatism or monocular
diplopia: Surgical removal of the lens and
possible IOL placement.
—Symptomatic cataract: Options include
surgical removal of the lens, mydriasis
(e.g., scopolamine 0.25% q.d.) and aphakic correction, pupillary constriction (e.g.,
pilocarpine 4% gel q.h.s.) and phakic correction, or a large optical iridectomy (away
from the lens).

13.11

•

—Methionine restricted, cysteine-supplemented diet.
—Avoid surgery if possible because of the
risk of thromboembolic complications. If
surgical intervention is necessary, anticoagulant therapy is indicated in conjunction
with internist.

Follow-Up
Depends on the etiology, degree of subluxation or dislocation, and symptoms.

symptoms related to low IOP.

hypotony maculopathy, chorioretinal folds,
serous choroidal detachment, suprachoroidal hemorrhage, the appearance of optic disc
swelling, and retinal vascular tortuosity.

Symptoms
May have mild to severe pain. Vision may be
reduced. Excessive tearing in patients after
glaucoma filtering procedures. May be asymptomatic.

Signs
Critical. Low IOP, usually <6 mm Hg, but
may occur with an IOP as high as 10 mm Hg.
Other. Corneal edema and folds, corneal
decompensation, aqueous cell and flare, shallow or flat anterior chamber, retinal edema,

LWBK1000-C13_p394-415.indd 407

Etiology
 Postsurgical: Wound leak, overfiltering bleb

(more common with use of antimetabolites during surgery) or glaucoma drainage device, cyclodialysis cleft (disinsertion
of the ciliary body from the sclera at the
scleral spur), scleral perforation (e.g., from a
superior rectus bridle suture or retrobulbar
injection), iridocyclitis, retinal or choroidal
detachment, and others.

General Ophthalmic Problems

 Pharmacologic: Usually from a carbonic

anhydrase inhibitor in combination with
a topical beta-blocker. Also associated with
cidofovir.
 Systemic (bilateral hypotony): Conditions

that cause blood hypertonicity (e.g., dehydration, uremia, hyperglycemia), myotonic
dystrophy, and others.
 Vascular occlusive disease (e.g., ocular isch-

emic syndrome, giant cell arteritis, central
retinal vein or artery occlusion): Usually
mild hypotony.
 Uveitis: Secondary to ciliary body shut-

down.

Work-Up
1. History: Recent ocular surgery or trauma?
Other systemic symptoms (nausea, vomiting, twitching, drowsiness, polyuria)? History of renal disease, diabetes, or myotonic
dystrophy? Medications?
2. Complete ocular examination, including
a slit-lamp evaluation of surgical or traumatic ocular wounds, IOP check, gonioscopy of the anterior chamber angle to rule
out a cyclodialysis cleft, and indirect ophthalmoscopy to rule out a retinal or choroidal detachment.
3. Seidel test (with or without gentle pressure)
to rule out a wound leak. See Appendix 5,
Seidel Test to Detect a Wound Leak.
NOTE: A wound leak may drain under the conjunctiva, producing a filtering bleb. Seidel test
will then be negative.

13

4. B-scan US when the fundus cannot be seen
clinically. Consider US biomicroscopy for
evaluation of the anterior chamber angle
and to evaluate for cyclodialysis cleft.
5. Blood tests in bilateral cases: Glucose, blood
urea nitrogen, and creatinine.

Treatment
Repair of the underlying disorder may be
needed if symptoms are significant or progressive. Low IOP, even as low as 2 mm Hg, may
not cause problems or symptoms and may be
observed.

LWBK1000-C13_p394-415.indd 408

Wound Leak
1. Large wound leaks: Suture the wound
closed.
2. Small wound leaks: Can be sutured closed
or can be patched with a pressure dressing
and an antibiotic ointment (e.g., erythromycin) for 1 night to allow the wound to
close spontaneously. A carbonic anhydrase
inhibitor and a nonselective topical betablocker (e.g., acetazolamide 500 mg sequel
p.o. and a drop of timolol 0.5%) are usually given if patching is to be used to reduce
aqueous flow through the wound.
NOTE: Occasionally, cyanoacrylate glue is applied
to small wound leaks and covered with a bandage contact lens.

3. Wound leaks under a conjunctival flap: Repair required only if vision affected or for
secondary ocular complication such as a
flat anterior chamber. Consider cryotherapy or argon laser therapy after painting the
conjunctiva with methylene blue or rose
bengal, or autologous blood injection.
Cyclodialysis Cleft
Reattach the ciliary body to the sclera by
chronic atropine therapy, diathermy, suturing,
cryotherapy, laser photocoagulation, external
plombage. See 3.7, Iridodialysis/Cyclodialysis.
Scleral Perforation
The site may be closed by suturing or cryotherapy.
Iridocyclitis
Topical steroid (e.g., prednisolone acetate 1%
q1–6h) and a topical cycloplegic (e.g., scopolamine 0.25% t.i.d.). See 12.1, Anterior Uveitis
(Iritis/Iridocyclitis).
Retinal Detachment
Surgical repair. See 11.3, Retinal Detachment.
Choroidal Detachment
See 11.27, Choroidal Effusion/Detachment. Surgical drainage of the choroidal effusion along
with reformation of the eye and anterior
chamber is indicated for any of the following:

3. A flat or persistently shallow anterior chamber accompanied by a failing filtering bleb
or an inflamed eye.

Pharmacologic
Reduce or discontinue the IOP-reducing medications.
Systemic Disorder
Refer to an internist.

409

NOTE: In myotonic dystrophy, the hypotony is
rarely severe enough to produce deleterious effects,
and treatment of hypotony, from an ocular standpoint, is unnecessary.

If vision is good, the anterior chamber is well
formed, and there is no wound leak, retinal
detachment, or kissing choroidal detachments, then the low IOP poses no immediate
problem, and treatment and follow-up are not
urgent. Fixed retinal folds in the macula may
develop from long-standing hypotony.

BLIND, PAINFUL EYE

A patient with a non-seeing eye and unsalvageable vision can experience mild to severe
ocular pain for a variety of reasons.

Causes of Pain
 Corneal

decompensation: Fluoresceinstaining defect on slit-lamp examination.
Improvement of pain with topical anesthetic.

 Uveitis: Anterior chamber or vitreous white

blood cells. If the cornea is opaque, the cells
might not be seen.
 Glaucoma with elevated IOP.
 Hypotony: Ciliary body shutdown, retinal

detachment, choroidal detachment, ciliary
body detachment. See 13.11, Hypotony Syndrome.

Work-Up
1. History: Determine the etiology and duration of the blindness.
2. Ocular examination: Stain the cornea with
fluorescein to detect an epithelial defect
and measure the IOP. Tono-Pen measurements may be required if the corneal
surface is irregular. If the cornea is clear,
look for neovascularization of the iris and
angle by gonioscopy, and inspect the anterior chamber for cells and flare. Attempt a

dilated retinal examination to rule out an
intraocular tumor or retinal detachment.
3. B-scan US of the posterior segment is required to rule out an intraocular tumor,
retinal detachment, or choroidal or ciliary
body detachment, when the fundus cannot
be adequately visualized.

Treatment
1. Sterile corneal decompensation (if it appears
infected, see 4.11, Bacterial Keratitis).
—Antibiotic ointment (e.g., erythromycin),
cycloplegia (e.g., atropine 1%), and a pressure patch for 24 to 48 hours.
—Antibiotic or lubricating ointment q.d. to
q.i.d. (after the patch is removed) for weeks
to months (or even permanently).
—Consider nightly patching.
—Consider a tarsorrhaphy, amniotic membrane graft, or Gunderson conjunctival flap
in refractory cases.

13

2. Uveitis.
—Cycloplegia (e.g., atropine 1% t.i.d.).
—Topical steroid (e.g., prednisolone acetate
1% q1–6h).
—Treat uveitis if it is present. See 12.1, Anterior Uveitis (Iritis/Iridocyclitis).

General Ophthalmic Problems

—Endophthalmitis should be ruled out if
severe uveitis or a hypopyon is present.
3. Markedly increased IOP.
—Topical beta-blocker (e.g., timolol 0.5%
b.i.d.) with or without an adrenergic agonist (e.g., brimonidine 0.2% b.i.d. to t.i.d.).
Topical carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (e.g.,
dorzolamide 2% t.i.d.) are effective, but
potential systemic side effects may not warrant their use for pain relief; miotics may
increase ocular irritation.
—If the IOP remains markedly increased and
is thought to be responsible for the pain, a
cyclodestructive procedure [e.g., yttriumaluminum garnet (YAG) or diode laser cyclophotocoagulation or cyclocryotherapy] may
be attempted. The potential for sympathetic
ophthalmia must be considered.
—If pain persists despite the previously
described treatment, a retrobulbar alcohol
block may be given. This is typically effective for approximately 3 to 6 months. Technique: 2 to 3 mL of lidocaine is administered in the retrobulbar region. The needle
is then held in place while the syringe of
lidocaine is replaced with a 1-mL syringe
containing 95% to 100% alcohol (some
physicians use 50% alcohol). The contents
of the alcohol syringe are then injected into
the retrobulbar space through the needle.
The syringes are again switched, so a small
amount of lidocaine can rinse out the
remaining alcohol. The retrobulbar needle
is then withdrawn. Patients are warned that
transient eyelid droop or swelling, limitation of eye movement, or anesthesia may
result. Retrobulbar chlorpromazine (25 to

50 mg, using 25 mg/mL) or phenol can also
be used. See Appendix 10, Technique for Retrobulbar/Subtenon/Subconjunctival Injections.
4. Hypotony.
a. Resolve causes of hypotony (e.g., repair
wound leak, treat uveitis or ciliochoroidal detachment). If retinal detachment
is found, repair could resolve hypotony.
5. Cause of pain unknown.
a. Cycloplegic (e.g., atropine 1% t.i.d.).
b. Topical steroid (e.g., prednisolone acetate 1% q1–6h).
c. Retrobulbar injections of neurolytic
agents can be considered. See Appendix
10, Technique for Retrobulbar/Subtenon/
Subconjunctival Injections.
6. Enucleation or evisceration: Patients with
ocular pain refractory to topical or retrobulbar injections should be considered
for enucleation or evisceration of the eye.
Evisceration should not be performed if intraocular malignancy is suspected. Enucleation does not relieve facial paresthesias.
7. All patients should wear protective eye
wear (e.g., polycarbonate lenses) at all times
to prevent injury to the contralateral eye.

Follow-Up
Depends on the degree of pain and the clinical
abnormalities present. Once the pain resolves,
patients are reexamined every 6 to 12 months.
B-scan US should be performed periodically
(typically every 5 years) to rule out an intraocular tumor when the posterior pole cannot
be visualized.

Inheritance
Nonheritable.

Work-Up

Treatment
1. Treat glaucoma if present. First-line drugs
are aqueous suppressants. Latanoprost,
pilocarpine, and epinephrine compounds
are less effective because of high episcleral
venous pressure. Surgery (goniotomy or trabeculectomy, or both) is often required. See
9.1, Primary Open-Angle Glaucoma.
2. Consider treating serous retinal detachments that threaten or involve the macula.
Laser photocoagulation success rate is low.
Low-dose radiotherapy often resolves the
subretinal fluid. Photodynamic therapy is
also successful for circumscribed tumors.

Follow-Up
Every 6 months or sooner for glaucoma
screening and retinal examination.

Imaging
Modalities in
Ophthalmology
PLAIN FILMS

Description
Images of radiopaque tissues obtained by
exposure of special photographic plates to
ionizing radiation.

Uses in Ophthalmology
May be used to identify or exclude radiopaque intraorbital or intraocular foreign
bodies. However, computed tomography

14.2

(CT) is the study of choice to evaluate for
foreign bodies, as CT has greater contrast
sensitivity over radiography. Plain films
remain a valid screening modality before
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) if an
occult metallic foreign body is suspected.
Plain films should not be used for the diagnosis of orbital fractures.

COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY

Description
CT uses ionizing radiation and computerassisted formatting to produce multiple crosssectional planar images. Possible image planes
include axial, direct coronal, reformatted
coronal, and reformatted parasagittal images.
Bone and soft-tissue windows should always
be reviewed in both axial and coronal orientations (see Figures 14.2.1–14.2.3). Orbital studies use 3-mm or thinner slices. Radiopaque
iodinated contrast allows more extensive evaluation of vascular structures and areas where
there is a breakdown of the normal capillary
endothelial barrier (as in inflammation).

2. Locating suspected intraorbital or intraocular metallic foreign bodies. Glass, wood,
and plastic are less radiopaque and therefore more difficult to isolate on CT.
3. Soft-tissue windows are good for determining
some pathologic features, including orbital

Uses in Ophthalmology
1. Excellent for defining bone abnormalities such as fractures (orbital wall or optic
canal), calcification, or bony involvement
of a soft-tissue mass.

adequate detail of the orbital anatomy, and
vice versa.

Guidelines for Ordering an Orbital Study
1. Always order a dedicated orbital study if
ocular or orbital pathology is suspected.
Always include views of paranasal sinuses
and cavernous sinuses.
2. Order both axial and coronal views.

FIGURE 14.2.2. Coronal soft-tissue window shows a
large blowout fracture of the orbital floor. This finding
could have been missed on axial study, demonstrating
the importance of reviewing both axial and coronal
images.

examination is inconclusive, but B-scan ultrasonography may be more sensitive.
4. Excellent for imaging paranasal sinus anatomy and disease.
5. Head CT helpful for locating parenchymal,
subarachnoid, subdural, epidural, and retrobulbar hemorrhage in either acute or subacute setting.
6. Imaging modality of choice for thyroidrelated orbitopathy. See 7.2.1, Thyroid Eye
Disease.
7. Any loss of consciousness requires CT of
the brain. CT of the brain does not provide

3. When evaluating traumatic optic neuropathy, request 1-mm cuts of the orbital apex
and optic canal to rule out bony impingement of the optic nerve.
4. When attempting to localize ocular or
orbital foreign bodies, order 1-mm cuts.
5. Contrast may be necessary for suspected
infections or inflammatory conditions.
Contrast is helpful in distinguishing orbital
cellulitis from abscess. However, contrast is
not mandatory to rule out orbital inflammation or postseptal involvement. Relative contraindications for contrast include
renal failure, diabetes, congestive heart failure, myeloma, sickle cell disease, multiple
severe allergies, and asthma. Check renal
function in patients in whom renal insufficiency is suspected.

NOTE: The radiologist may recommend premedication with corticosteroids if contrast is
required and a prior allergy is suspected. Follow
the protocol recommended by your radiology
department.

6. Obtain pregnancy test before obtaining CT
scans in females of childbearing age if possible.

FIGURE 14.2.3. Coronal bone window shows the
fracture again. In bone windows, the soft-tissue detail
fades, but bone detail is enhanced, allowing for better
examination of bony anatomy.

7. CT angiography (CTA) is helpful in diagnosing intracranial vascular pathology,
including aneurysms. It is available on
all multidetector CT scanners and in general is more sensitive than magnetic resonance angiography (MRA). However, it
requires the use of intravenous iodinated
contrast.

protocols for CT scans that limit the amount of
radiation exposure. If available, these should be

T1 prior to gadolinium injection. The notable exceptions are listed in Table 14.3.2.

Uses in Ophthalmology

4. For suspected neurogenic tumors (meningioma, glioma), gadolinium is essential in
defining lesion extent.
5. All patients with clinical signs or symptomatic optic neuritis from suspected demyelinating disease should undergo brain MRI
[fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR)
images are especially useful]. See Figure 14.3.4

7. Diffusion-weighted imaging can help differentiate the various phases of cerebral infarction (e.g., hyperacute, acute, subacute, and
chronic).

Guidelines for Ordering the Study
1. For the vast majority of orbital studies, a
head coil is indicated to provide bilateral
orbital views extending to the optic chiasm.
2. Intravenous gadolinium is useful for
augmenting ocular, orbital, and perineural masses. In patients who have kidney
failure, nephrogenic systemic fibrosis is
a rare complication of gadolinium that

14.4
14

occurs weeks to months after administration. It is characterized by a thickening
and hardening of the skin, especially over
extremities and trunk. There is no known
proven therapy. Evaluate renal function
in patients in whom renal insufficiency is
suspected.
3. Contraindications to MRI: Severe claustrophobia, marked obesity, cardiac pacemakers, some cardiac valves, suspected magnetic
intraocular/intraorbital foreign bodies, spinal stimulators, vagal nerve stimulators, stapes implants, and specific breast and penile
implants. Titanium plates and newer aneurysm clips are MRI safe as are gold weights
placed in the eyelids. When in doubt, ask
the radiologist to look up the specific device in an MRI safety catalog. Any patient
with a poorly documented implanted device
should NOT be scanned with MRI.

MAGNETIC RESONANCE ANGIOGRAPHY

Description

Uses in Ophthalmology

Special application of MRI technology in
which signal from flowing blood is augmented while signal from stationary tissues is
suppressed. MRA allows for three-dimensional
rotational reconstruction.

nerve palsy), arteriovenous malformations,
and acquired arteriovenous communications.
3. Suspected orbital or intracranial vascular
mass. Note that MRA is best for imaging
high-flow and large-caliber lesions. Lowerflow lesions (e.g., varix) are not well seen.
MRA also has limited potential in visualizing cavernous sinus fistulas; color Doppler
studies and conventional arteriography are
more sensitive in making this diagnosis.

carries significant morbidity and mortality in
certain populations. Currently, the limit of
MRA is an aneurysm larger than 2 mm. However, the sensitivity is highly dependent on
several factors: hardware, software, and the
experience of the neuroradiologist. Despite
these potential limitations, MRA remains a
safe and sensitive screening test, especially
when coupled with MRI for concomitant softtissue imaging. CTA in many situations can
provide a suitable replacement for conventional angiography.

Cerebral arteriography remains the gold standard for diagnosis of vascular lesions but

CEREBRAL ARTERIOGRAPHY

Description
This interventional examination entails intraarterial injection of radiopaque contrast followed by rapid-sequence x-ray imaging of the
region of interest to evaluate the transit of blood
through the regional vasculature. Unlike MRA
or CTA, catheter arteriography allows the option
of simultaneous treatment of lesions by intravascular techniques. Arteriography is the gold
standard for diagnosing intracranial aneurysms
but is being replaced in many centers by CTA.

2. Evaluation of ocular ischemic syndrome or
amaurosis fugax due to suspected atherosclerotic carotid, aortic arch, or ophthalmic

NUCLEAR MEDICINE

Description
Nuclear medicine imaging uses radioactive
contrast (radionuclide) that emits gamma
radiation, which is then gathered by a gamma
ray detector. The classic types of radionuclide
scanning known to ophthalmologists include
bone scanning, liver–spleen scanning, and
gallium scanning. Positron emission tomography (PET) is useful in determining metabolic
activity within a lesion and may be coupled
with CT for anatomic detail.

Uses in Ophthalmology
1. Scintigraphy (e.g., with technetium-99):
Useful for assessing lacrimal drainage physiology in patients with contradictory or
inconsistent irrigation testing.
2. Systemic gallium scan: Useful for detecting
extraocular sarcoidosis and Sjogren syndrome.

14.8

3. Technetium 99m-tagged red blood cell
study: Occasionally used to distinguish
cavernous hemangioma/hemangiopericytoma from other solid masses in the orbit.
4. PET: The use of PET for the diagnosis and
management of orbital disease is still an
evolving technique. Limitations in this
area include the high background metabolic activity of the adjacent brain which
may mask orbital abnormalities, the size of
the orbital pathology (current PET scanners
have a resolution of about 7 mm), and the
relatively indolent nature of most orbital
lymphomas (decreasing the intensity of the
signal on PET). PET is extremely useful in
the diagnosis and surveillance of systemic
pathologies, including lymphoma and metastases, and at present, this remains the
primary role of PET in the management of
orbital disease.

OPHTHALMIC ULTRASONOGRAPHY

A-SCAN
Description
(See Figure 14.8.1.)
A-scan, or amplitude-modulated ultrasound
(US), uses ultrasonic waves (8 to 12 MHz) to generate linear distance versus amplitude of reflectivity curves of the evaluated ocular and orbital
tissues. A-scans are one dimensional and used for
measuring and characterizing the composition
of tissues on the basis of the reflectivity curves.
Not all A-scan instruments are standardized.

14

Uses in Ophthalmology
1. Primary use in ophthalmology is measurement of axial length of the globe. This
information is critical for intraocular lens
(IOL) power calculations for cataract surgery. Axial length information can also be
used to identify certain congenital disorders
such as microphthalmia, nanophthalmos,
intraocular tumor size, intrinsic tumor vascularity, and congenital glaucoma.
2. Diagnostic identification of the echogenicity
characteristics of masses in the globe or orbit
with standardized A-scan probe.
3. Specialized A-mode ultrasonography can be
used for corneal pachymetry (measurement
of corneal thickness).

posterior aspect of the globe. Both contact and
water-bath techniques may be used, but the
contact method does not visualize the anterior chamber well.

Uses in Ophthalmology
1. Define ocular anatomy in the presence
of media opacities (e.g., mature cataract,
hyphema, corneal opacity, vitreous hemorrhage, trauma) to evaluate retinal and/or
choroidal pathology.
2. Diagnosis of scleral rupture posterior to the
muscle insertions or when media opacities
prevent direct visualization.
3. Identify intraocular foreign bodies especially
if made of metal or glass (spherical objects
have a specific echo shadow); wood or
vegetable matter has variable echogenicity;
can also give a more precise location if the
foreign body is next to the scleral wall.
4. Evaluation of intraocular tumor/mass consistency, retinal detachment, choroidal

detachment (serous vs. hemorrhagic), and
optic disc abnormalities (e.g., optic disc
drusen, coloboma).

Guidelines for Ordering the Study
1. If used in the setting of trauma to determine unknown scleral rupture, the probe
is used over closed eyelids with immersion
in copious amounts of sterile methylcellulose, such that no pressure is placed on the
globe. The gain must be set higher to overcome the sound attenuation of the eyelids.
Known ruptured globe is a relative contraindication to B-scan US.
2. When scleral integrity is not in question,
B-scan US should be performed dynamically to help differentiate pathologic conditions, such as retinal detachment versus
posterior vitreous detachment.
3. Dense intraocular calcifications (such as
those occurring in many eyes with phthisis
bulbi) result in poor-quality images.
4. Silicone oil and intraocular gas in the vitreous cause distortion of the scanned image,
and therefore the study should be performed in an upright patient.

ULTRASONOGRAPHIC BIOMICROSCOPY
Description
(See Figure 14.8.3.)
Uses ultra–high-frequency (50 MHz) B-mode
US of the anterior one-fifth of the globe to
give cross sections at near-microscopic resolution. Uses a water-bath eyelid speculum with
viscous liquid in the bowl of the speculum.

Uses in Ophthalmology
1. Excellent for defining corneoscleral or limbal pathologic conditions, anterior chamber
angle, ciliary body, pathologic iris conditions (e.g., ciliary body masses/cysts, plateau
iris, location of IOL), and small anterior foreign bodies.
2. Unexplained unilateral angle narrowing or

PHOTOGRAPHIC STUDIES

Description
Various methods of imaging the eyes or
selected regions of the eye, using white light
or various spectral wavelengths of light.

Types of Ophthalmic Photographic
Imaging Studies
1. Documentary photography: Color pictures
of face, external eye, anterior segment, and
fundus (white light or red-free lighting) (see
Figure 14.9.1).
2. Fundus autofluorescence (FAF): Imaging
modality that takes advantage of the naturally and pathologically occurring fluorophores in the fundus. Provides sensitive

information regarding the health of the
retinal pigment epithelium and allows
early detection and monitoring of a variety
of conditions such as AMD, macular dystrophies, and medication toxicity. Addtionally, FAF is useful in the evaluation of
certain ocular tumors, specifically, choroidal nevi and melanomas (see Figure 14.9.2).
3. Specular microscopy: Contact and noncontact photographic techniques used to image
the corneal endothelium. The images can
then be used to evaluate the quality and
quantity of the endothelial cells.

Intravenous Fluorescein Angiography

425

INTRAVENOUS FLUORESCEIN ANGIOGRAPHY

Description
(See Figure 14.10.1.)
Intravenous fluorescein angiography is a type
of angiographic photography that does not
rely on ionizing radiation or iodine-based
contrast. After intravenous injection of fluorescein solution (usually in a hand or arm
vein), rapid-sequence photography is performed by using a camera with spectral excitation and barrier filters. Fluorescein sodium
absorbs blue light, with peak absorption and
excitation occurring at wavelengths of 465
to 490 nm. Fluorescence then occurs at the
yellow-green wavelengths of 520 to 530 nm.
The fluorescein molecule is 80% proteinbound and does not pass through the tight
junctions of a healthy blood–retinal barrier
(pigment epithelium and retinal capillaries
are impermeable, whereas Bruch membrane
and choriocapillaris lack tight junctions and
are freely permeable).

Phases of the Intravenous
Fluorescein Angiography
1. Choroidal filling (background fluorescence): 8 to 15 seconds after injection. Choroid is normally completely filled within
5 seconds after dye appearance within it.

2. Arterial phase: Starts 1 to 2 seconds after
choroidal filling.
3. Arteriovenous phase (laminar flow).
4. Venous phase: Arteriovenous transit time is
the time from the first appearance of dye
within the retinal arteries of the temporal
arcade until the corresponding veins are
completely filled; normal, <11 seconds.
5. Recirculation phase: 45 to 60 seconds after
arterial phase.
6. Late phase: 10 to 30 minutes post-injection.
Foveal dark spot can result from xanthophyll pigment in the outer plexiform layer or tall retinal
pigment epithelium (RPE) cells with increased
melanin or lipofuscin. The foveal avascular zone
is the central area which has no retinal capillaries
(300 to 500 microns in diameter).

Describing an Abnormal Study
Hyperfluorescence
1. Leakage: Fluorescein penetrates the blood–
retinal barrier and accumulates sub-, intra-,
or preretinally. Hyperfluorescence increases
in size and brightness as study progresses
[e.g., choroidal or retinal neovascularization,
central serous chorioretinopathy (CSCR),
cystoid macular edema (CME)].
2. Staining: Fluorescence gradually increases
in brightness but its borders remain fixed
(e.g., scar or scleral show).
3. Pooling: Accumulation of fluorescein in
fluid-filled space in retina or choroid. The
margins of the space trapping fluorescein
are distinct [e.g., pigment epithelial detachment (PED), CSCR].
4. Window or transmission defect: Focal area
of hyperfluorescence without leakage usually due to RPE atrophy (e.g., geographic
atrophy, RPE rip, laser scar).

angiography.

5. Autofluorescence: Structures that naturally
fluoresce can be captured on film prior to
intravenous fluorescein injection (e.g., optic nerve drusen and lipofuscin).

Hypofluorescence
1. Blockage: Due to optical density such as
blood, pigment, or fibrous tissue interposed
between the camera and the choriocapillaris.
2. Vascular occlusion: Nonfilling vessel(s) causing relative or absolute hypofluorescence
(e.g., central retinal artery occlusion). Applies
to both capillaries and larger vessels.

Uses in Ophthalmology
1. Used to image retinal, choroidal, optic disc,
iris vasculature, or a combination of these.
It is used for diagnosis and therapeutic
planning (e.g., retinal lasers).
2. Transit times between injection and appearance of dye in the choroid, retinal arteries,
and veins also can be used to evaluate vascular flow. Arm to retina time is less accurate than intraretinal circulation.

14.11

4. Suspected choroidal neovascularization
(CNV) from various diseases (e.g., age-related
macular degeneration).

Guidelines for Ordering the Study
1. Side effects of intravenous fluorescein are
nausea (10%), vomiting (2%), hives, pruritus, and vasovagal response. True anaphylaxis is rare. Death may occur in 1
out of 220,000 injections. Extravasation
into extracellular space at the injection
site can produce local necrosis. Treat with
cool compresses. Excreted in urine in 24 to
36 hours. Urine will be bright yellow.
2. Because it is a photographic method, moderately clear media is required for visualization.

INDOCYANINE GREEN ANGIOGRAPHY

Description
Photographic method of ocular angiography
similar to intravenous fluorescein angiography
utilizing tricarbocyanine dye, an iodine-based
dye. Indocyanine green (ICG) angiography
differs in that fluorescence occurs in the infrared spectrum (835 nm), allowing for penetration through pigment, fluid, and blood. ICG
provides better evaluation of the choroidal
vasculature. ICG excitation occurs at 805 nm,
with fluorescence at 835 nm. The ICG molecule is approximately 95% protein-bound.

3. Suspected retinal ischemia (capillary nonperfusion) and neovascularization from
various conditions (e.g., diabetes).

4. Suspected polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy. See 11.18, Idiopathic Polypoidal Choroidal Vasculopathy (Posterior Uveal Bleeding
Syndrome).
5. Other accepted uses: Identifying feeder
vessels in retinal angiomatous proliferation lesions in age-related macular degeneration, chronic CSCR, certain inflammatory conditions, and occasionally helpful
in diagnosing certain posterior-segment
tumors).

Optical Coherence Tomography

427

OPTICAL COHERENCE TOMOGRAPHY

Description
(See Figure 14.12.1.)
Optical coherence tomography (OCT) provides noninvasive, noncontact two- or threedimensional images by measuring optical
reflections of light. In this manner, OCT is
similar to US except that OCT is based on
the reflection of light, not sound. The OCT
scanner sends low-coherence light (820-nm
wavelength) emitted by a superluminescent
diode to the tissue to be examined and to
a reference beam. The time delays of the
light reflections from retinal structures are
recorded by an interferometer. Using a reference mirror, these light reflections are then
translated into an imaged object with a high
resolution of up to 3 microns. The most
highly reflective structures are the nerve
fiber layer and the RPE. Highly reflective
lesions include dense pigmentation, scar tissue, neovascularization, and hard exudates.
Low-reflectivity in pathologic conditions
include areas of edema.

Enhanced depth imaging OCT is a technique used to improve the detail of the choroid.

Uses in Ophthalmology
1. Retinal diseases including macular edema,
macular atrophy, CSCR, age-related macular degeneration, CNV, CME, retinal detachment, PED, retinal tumors, drusen, and
hard exudates.
2. Vitreoretinal interface abnormalities including macular holes, cysts, epiretinal membranes, and vitreoretinal strands or traction.
3. Suspected glaucoma, including quantification of the nerve fiber layer thickness and
optic nerve cup characteristics.
4. Suspected optic neuritis, other optic neuropathies, and multiple sclerosis.
5. Anterior-segment pathology.

Guidelines for Ordering the Study
Requires patient’s ability to fixate and relatively clear media.

CONFOCAL SCANNING LASER
OPHTHALMOSCOPY

14.13
Description

Uses in Ophthalmology

Confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscopy is
a noninvasive imaging technique to obtain
high-resolution optical images and evaluate the topography of ocular structures.
This confocal optical system provides a
contour map of the desired structure in a
process known as “optical sectioning.” The
system aims to detect reflected light from
a very thin optical plane, the focal plane.
A series of “focal planes” or images may be
recorded and combined to create a threedimensional image (e.g., Heidelberg retinal
tomography).

1. Suspected optic nerve disease, including
glaucoma and papilledema.

14.14

2. Suspected fundus elevations, including
macular edema and choroidal nevi.

Guidelines for Ordering the Study
1. Requires patient's ability to fixate and relatively clear media.
2. Because the hallmark of the test is to provide comparative data, subsequent tests in
the same patient need accurate alignment
in the same focal plane to provide useful
information.

CORNEAL TOPOGRAPHY AND TOMOGRAPHY

Description
Standard keratometry measures the radius
of corneal curvature and then converts the
radius into dioptric corneal power. Computerized corneal topography is performed
using various methods, including Placido disc
analysis, scanning slit beam, and rasterste-

reography. These techniques project an image
onto the cornea, most commonly a series of
concentric rings, and analyze the reflection
to determine corneal shape. They can provide information on anterior (and in some
cases posterior) corneal curvature and regularity. Simulated keratometry readings can be

Corneal tomography, the computerized
reconstruction of multiple images of cornea,
may help give detailed information about the
anterior, posterior, and central cornea. These
techniques include anterior-segment OCT,
scanning slit, and rotating Scheimpflug photography–based systems. Scanning slit and rotating Scheimpflug imaging are particularly helpful in imaging posterior corneal elevation and
anterior-segment anatomy. All tomographic
systems also measure corneal thickness.

corneal surgery, corneal trauma, contact lens
warpage, inherited corneal dystrophies, and
corneal scars from inflammatory or infectious
etiologies. It may be helpful in identifying the
cause of decreased vision in patients with no

system anatomy when the cause of obstruction is maldevelopment, tumor, or even
lacrimal stones with visualization of bony
landmarks.
3. May be helpful in determining lacrimal
pump function.

COVER/UNCOVER AND ALTERNATE
COVER TESTS

COVER/UNCOVER TEST
The primary purpose is to detect a tropia (a
deviation when both eyes are open) and/or
a phoria (a latent deviation that manifests
when binocular fusion is disrupted).

Requirements
Full range of ocular motility, vision adequate
to see the target of fixation, foveal fixation
in each eye, and patient cooperation. This
test should be performed before the alternate
cover test (see below).

Method
1. Ask the patient to fixate on a non-accommodative target at distance (e.g., a letter on
the vision chart).
2. Cover one of the patient’s eyes while observing the uncovered eye. A refixation move-

LWBK1000-CAppI_p430-445.indd 431

ment of the uncovered eye indicates the
presence of a manifest deviation (tropia).
Prisms may be used to quantify this. In the
absence of a tropia, deviation of the covered
eye that refixates when the cover is removed
indicates a latent deviation (phoria).
3. Repeat the procedure, covering the opposite eye.
4. If there is no movement of either eye, the eyes
are aligned with both eyes open (no tropia).
5. Ask the patient to fixate on an accommodative target at near. Both eyes are tested at
near in the manner described previously.
NOTE: An esodeviation is detected by a refixation
movement temporally (the eye being observed
turns away from the nose). An exodeviation is detected by a refixation movement nasally (the eye being observed turns toward the nose). A hyperdeviation is detected by a refixation movement inferiorly.

Method

ALTERNATE COVER TEST
When it has been determined by the cover/
uncover test if there is a tropia or phoria, the
alternate cover test may be use to dissociate
the two eyes and further quantify the total
deviation. The alternate cover test does not
distinguish manifest from latent deviations.

Requirements
Same as for the cover/uncover test above.

Method
1. Ask the patient to fixate on a non-accommodative target at distance. To make certain that he or she is fixing on the target,
ask that the letters be read or the picture
described.
2. Repeatedly cover one eye and then quickly
move the cover to the other eye. The eye
being uncovered may be noted to swing
into position to refixate on the target, indicating the presence of a deviation. Then
repeat the test at near.

ALTERNATE COVER TEST WITH PRISM
Measures the size of the total deviation,
regardless of whether a phoria or tropia is
present.

APPENDIX

1. Have the patient wear his or her glasses and
occlude the left eye while an Amsler grid
is held approximately 12 inches in front of
the right eye (Figure A.4.1).
2. The patient is asked what is in the center of
the page. Failure to see the central dot may
indicate a central scotoma.
3. Have the patient fixate on the central dot
(or the center of the page if he or she cannot see the dot). Ask if all four corners of
the diagram are visible and if any of the
boxes are missing.

LWBK1000-CAppI_p430-445.indd 432

2. Measurements may be done for any direction of gaze by turning the patient’s head
away from the target while asking him or
her to maintain fixation on it (e.g., right
gaze is measured by turning the patient’s
head toward his or her left shoulder and
asking the patient to look at the target).
3. In general, measurements are taken in the
straight-ahead position (both at distance
and near), in right gaze, left gaze, downgaze
(the head is tilted up while the patient focuses on the target), upgaze (the head is tilted down while the patient focuses on the
target), and with the patient’s head tilted
toward either shoulder. Measurements are
taken both with and without glasses in the
straight-ahead position.

AMSLER GRID

Used to test macular function or to detect a
central or paracentral scotoma.

APP

1. To measure a deviation, prisms are placed
in front of one eye with the prism base
placed in the direction of eye movement.
While continuing to alternately cover,
as described above, increase the prism
strength until eye movement ceases. The
strength of the weakest prism that eliminates eye movement during the alternate
cover is the amount of the deviation.

4. Again, while staring at the central dot, ask the
patient if all of the lines are straight and continuous or if some are distorted and broken.
5. The patient is asked to outline any missing
or distorted areas on the grid with a pencil.
6. Repeat the procedure, covering the right
eye and testing the left.
NOTE:
1. It is very important to monitor the patient’s
eye for movement away from the central dot.
2. A red Amsler grid may define more subtle
defects.

test can only be used in a cooperative, alert
patient.

TECHNIQUE FOR DIAGNOSTIC PROBING
AND IRRIGATION OF THE LACRIMAL SYSTEM

1. Anesthetize the eye with a drop of topical
anesthetic (e.g., proparacaine) and hold a
cotton-tipped applicator soaked in the topical anesthetic on the involved punctum for
several minutes.
2. Dilate the punctum with a punctum dilator
(Figure A.7.1).
3. Gently insert a #00 Bowman probe into the
punctum 2 mm vertically, and then 8 mm
horizontally, toward the nose. Avoid using
smaller probes, as they can create a false
passage. Pull the involved eyelid laterally
while slowly moving the probe horizontally to facilitate the procedure and to avoid
creating a false passageway.
4. In the presence of an eyelid laceration, a
torn canaliculus may be diagnosed by the
appearance of the probe in the site of the
eyelid laceration. See 3.8, Eyelid Laceration.
5. Irrigation of the lacrimal system is performed
after removing the probe and inserting an

Two to 3 mL of saline is gently pushed into

also diagnoses a severed canaliculus. Resistance to injection of the saline, ballooning
of the lacrimal sac, or leakage of the saline
out of either punctum may be the result of
a lacrimal system obstruction. If soft-tissue
edema occurs during irrigation, stop immediately—a false passage may have been
created. A patent lacrimal system usually

2. At the slit lamp, scrape the ulcer base
(unless significant corneal thinning has
occurred) and the leading edge of the infiltrate firmly with the spatula, blade, or
swab. Place the specimens on the slides
first, then the culture media. Sterilize the
spatula over the flame of the alcohol lamp
between each separate culture or slide. Be
certain that the spatula tip temperature has
returned to normal before touching the
cornea again.

Media
Routine:
1. Blood agar (most bacteria).
2. Sabouraud dextrose agar without cycloheximide; place at room temperature
(fungi).
3. Thioglycolate broth (aerobic and anaerobic
bacteria).
4. Chocolate agar; place into a CO2 jar (Haemophilus species, Neisseria gonorrhoeae).

2. Nonnutrient agar with Escherichia coli overlay if available (Acanthamoeba).

Slides
Routine:
1. Gram stain (bacteria, fungi).
2. Calcofluor white; a fluorescent microscope
is needed (Acanthamoeba, fungi).
Optional:
1. Giemsa stain (bacteria, fungi, Acanthamoeba).
2. Acid-fast stain (mycobacteria, Nocardia species).
3. Gomori methenamine silver stain, periodic
acid–Schiff (PAS) stain (Acanthamoeba,
fungi).
4. KOH wet mount (fungi, Nocardia species,
Acanthamoeba).
5. Extra slide to send to pathology at a local
institution.
NOTE: When a fungal infection is suspected, deep
scrapings into the base of the ulcer are essential.
Sometimes a corneal biopsy is necessary to obtain
diagnostic information for fungal, atypical mycobacterial, and Acanthamoeba infections.

TECHNIQUE FOR RETROBULBAR/
SUBTENON/SUBCONJUNCTIVAL
INJECTIONS

Retrobulbar Injection
1. Clean the skin of the lower lid and upper
cheek around the area of the inferior orbital
rim with an alcohol swab.
2. With the patient in primary gaze, use a
1.25-inch 25- or 27-gauge needle (preferably a short-beveled blunt retrobulbar
needle) to penetrate the skin just superior
to the inferior orbital rim in line with the
lateral limbus.
3. Advance the needle parallel to the orbital
floor. After passing parallel to the equator
of the globe, redirect the needle superonasally into the muscle cone.
4. Lateral motions of the needle are made to
ensure that the needle has not penetrated
the sclera (at which point, lateral motion
would be inhibited).

APP

5. Pull back on the syringe to ensure no vascular structures have been penetrated. If
no aspiration occurs, slowly inject the contents of syringe. In a successful injection,
the globe may move anteriorly due to the
retrobulbar pressure.

LWBK1000-CAppI_p430-445.indd 438

6. Withdraw the needle along the same contour as insertion. Perform orbital compression for at least 2 minutes.

Subtenon Injection
1. Apply topical anesthesia to the area to be injected (e.g., topical proparacaine or a cottontipped applicator soaked in proparacaine, or
both, held on the area for 1 to 2 minutes).
Place a drop of topical 5% povidone-iodine
on the surface of the eye. If subtenon steroids are to be injected, 0.1 mL of lidocaine
may be injected in the same manner as described next, several minutes before the steroids. The inferotemporal quadrant is usually the easiest location for injection.
2. With the aperture of a 25-gauge, 5/8-inch
needle facing the sclera, the bulbar conjunctiva is penetrated 2 to 3 mm from the
fornix, avoiding conjunctival blood vessels.
3. As the needle is inserted, lateral motions of
the needle are made to ensure that the needle has not penetrated the sclera (at which
point, lateral motion would be inhibited).
4. The curvature of the eyeball is followed, attempting to place the aperture of the needle near the posterior sclera.

22/12/11 12:38 AM

A P P ENDIX

5. When the needle has been pushed in to the
hilt, the stopper of the syringe is withdrawn
to ensure the needle is not intravascular.
6. The contents of the syringe are injected,
and the needle is removed.

Subconjunctival Injection
1. Apply topical anesthesia and antiseptic as
above.
2. Forceps are used to tent the conjunctiva, allowing the tip of a 25-gauge, 5/8-inch needle
to penetrate the subconjunctival space. The
needle is placed several millimeters below
the limbus at the 4- or 8-o’clock position,

APPENDIX

11

2. Consider further ocular anesthesia with viscous lidocaine, a cocaine-soaked cotton-tip
applicator directly on the anticipated site
of needle insertion, subconjunctival, subtenon or retrobulbar lidocaine.
3. The site of needle insertion should be in the
inferotemporal quadrant, 3.5 mm from the

with the aperture facing the sclera and the
needle pointed inferiorly toward the fornix.
3. When the entire tip of the needle is beneath the conjunctiva, the stopper of the
syringe is withdrawn to ensure the needle
is not intravascular.
4. The contents of the syringe are injected,
and the needle is removed.
NOTE: An eyelid speculum may be helpful in
keeping the eyelids open during subtenon and
subconjunctival injections.

INTRAVITREAL TAP AND INJECT

1. Anesthetize the eye with a topical anesthetic (e.g., proparacaine) and place an
eyelid speculum.Place a drop of topical 5%
povidone-iodine on the surface of the eye.

4. Penetrate the eye with a 27-gauge needle
on a 3 mL syringe. Aspirate about 0.2 mL of
vitreous.
NOTE: Always aim the needle toward the optic
nerve (Figure A.11.2).

5. Through the same insertion site, inject
0.2 mL of intravitreal antibiotics. See

2. Retract the eyelid with an eyelid speculum.
3. Place a drop of topical 5% povidoneiodine on the surface of the eye.
4. Use an operating microscope or slit lamp

6. In eyes with intraocular pressure <8 mm
Hg, fixation forceps may be necessary.
Anesthetize the base of the lateral rectus
muscle by holding a cotton-tipped applicator dipped in the topical anesthetic

LWBK1000-CAppI_p430-445.indd 440

NOTE: To best provide countertraction and
minimize globe rotation, the eye is fixated at
the same side of needle insertion.

7. Use a 30-gauge short needle on a syringe
and remove the plunger.
8. Enter the eye at an area with a sufficiently
formed anterior chamber. Keep the bevel
of the needle pointing anteriorly (toward
the epithelium) and away from the lens.
Keep the tip of the needle over the iris

ANGLE CLASSIFICATION

Proper evaluation of the configuration of the
anterior chamber requires the use of at least
three descriptors: the point at which the
peripheral iris is adherent to the cornea or

of complication and is to be avoided if possible.

uvea, the depth of the anterior chamber, and
the curvature of the peripheral iris. The Spaeth
grading system of the anterior chamber angle
takes into account all three of these attributes.

Spaeth Grading System (Figure A.14.1)
Iris Insertion
A = Anterior to Schwalbe line (SL)
B = Between SL and scleral spur
C = Scleral spur visible (common in blacks and
Asians)
D = Deep: ciliary body visible (common in
whites)
E = Extremely deep: >1 mm of ciliary body is
visible
Indentation gonioscopy may be necessary
to differentiate false opposition of the iris
against structures in the iridocorneal angle
from the true iris insertion. First, make note
of the most posterior portion of the inner wall
of the eye that can be seen without indenta-

tion. The iris is then displaced posteriorly by
indenting the cornea. This allows determination of the true iris insertion. When the true
iris insertion is different from the preindentation appearance, the preindentation appearance is placed in parentheses. For example, a
(B)D means that without indentation it is not
possible to see any of the scleral spur or ciliary
body, but with indentation the ciliary body
can be seen.
Angle of Anterior Chamber

angle between a line parallel to the corneal
endothelium at Schwalbe line and a line parallel to the anterior surface of the iris.

YAG LASER PERIPHERAL IRIDOTOMY

Also see 9.4, Acute Angle-Closure Glaucoma.
1. Perform pre-laser peripheral iridotomy
(LPI) gonioscopy to assess baseline angle.
2. Inform the patient that they may experience
ghost imaging after LPI due to the newly
created iris defect. In effort to minimize this
risk, note the position of the upper eyelid
with respect to the superior iris. If the upper
eyelid covers the superior iris, create the LPI
through the superior iris. If the upper eyelid
only partially covers the superior iris, there
is increased risk of post-LPI ghost image due
to the tear film meniscus. In such cases, consider creating the LPI at either 3- or 9-o’clock
where there is no tear film meniscus.
3. Pretreat the eye with one drop each of
apraclonidine 1% and pilocarpine (1%
for lightly pigmented irides, 2% for darkly
pigmented). As an alternative to pilocarpine, some ophthalmologists prefer to
shine a bright light into the fellow eye
immediately before engaging the laser.
This light allows for physiologic constriction of the operative pupil.

5. Anesthetize the eye (e.g., proparacaine).
6. Place an Abraham YAG iridotomy contact
lens cushioned with 2.5% hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose, positioning the magnification button above the anticipated site of iris
penetration.

NOTE: Keep the lens perpendicular to the YAG
beam to ensure good focus and laser concentration.

7. Focus the YAG beam on the predetermined
iris location (see #2, above). Focus within
an iris crypt if possible (Figure A.15.1).
8. Engage the laser. There will be a gush
of posterior iris pigment when the iris

4. Laser settings:
—Power: 4 to 7 mJ
—Spot Size: 10 to 70 um
—Shots/pulse: 3

NOTE: Darker irides usually require more total
power.

10. Check post-LPI intraocular pressure and
gonioscopy.
11. Treat inflammation with prednisolone 1%
q.i.d. for 4 to 7 days. If the LPI required
a significant amount of power (e.g., more
than six triple shots), taper the steroids
before discontinuation.

YAG CAPSULOTOMY

Typically performed for symptomatic posterior capsule opacity in pseudophakic patients
(Figure A.16.1).

7. Upon completion, treat the eye with one
drop each of prednisolone 1% and apraclonidine 1%.

1. Assess the pupillary aperture prior to dilation.

8. Optional: treat postcapsulotomy inflammation with prednisolone 1% q.i.d. for 4 to
7 days. Inflammation after capsulotomy is
usually minimal.

2. Dilate the pupil.
3. Laser settings:
—Power: 1 to 3 mJ
—Shots/pulse: 1
—Mode: fm
—Focus: 0 to 1

9. Check the intraocular pressure in 20 to
40 minutes, and in 1 week.
NOTE: Lens pitting and a rise in intraocular pressure (usually temporary) are the most common
complications.

NOTE: In an effort to minimize total energy, start
with a lower power and titrate up as needed.
To prevent pitting the intraocular lens, displace or focus the laser beam posteriorly.

4. Anesthetize the eye (e.g., proparacaine).
5. Consider placing a YAG capsulotomy contact lens cushioned with 2.5% hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose. Some prefer to not use
a contact lens.
6. Focus on the posterior lens capsule and
engage the laser. A common technique is a
cruciate capsulotomy.
NOTE: The capsulotomy only needs to be as big
as the undilated pupil.

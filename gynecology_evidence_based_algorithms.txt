PREFACE
Evidence-based medicine is the conscientious, explicit, and judicious use of current best evidence in making
decisions about the care of individual patients. With the evolution of evidence-based medicine, and the explosion
of medical literature, there has been a continuous stream of guidelines published in obstetrics and gynaecology.
These guidelines, designed to provide systematically developed recommendations, assist clinicians and patients
in making decisions about appropriate treatment for specific conditions. They also provide crucial information
for candidates preparing for the Member of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (MRCOG)
examination. Our attempt is to bring together the essential information contained in these guidelines in these
comprehensive books. Where guidelines do not exist, we have relied on available evidence and accepted norms
of practice. The information is presented in flowcharts, representing a step-by-step method of solving a clinical
problem.
As our books are a revision guide for MRCOG candidates, we have focused primarily on RCOG and other
UK national guidelines. However, many chapters contain a ‘Guideline Comparator’ box carrying information
from other important international guidelines, thus providing an international perspective. Several chapters also
contain a ‘what not to do’ box, which should act as a source of rich debate! Our desire is that these books act as
an essential tool for clinicians and examination candidates. However, they should not replace a close study of the
guidelines themselves.

SECTION 1

Early pregnancy care

CHAPTER 1 Early pregnancy bleeding and miscarriage
Spontaneous loss of a pregnancy before 24 weeks’ gestation.

Background and prevalence

Risks or complications

• Miscarriage in early pregnancies occurs in 10–20% of pregnancies.
• Biochemical miscarriage – by measuring β-hCG at a stage when the woman is unaware that she is
pregnant, up to 30% of pregnancies are found to miscarry.
• Approximately 50% of women with bleeding in early pregnancy have a miscarriage.
• Miscarriage risk is reduced in women with continuing pregnancy-associated vomiting.
• Most non-recurrent miscarriages are caused by abnormalities in the embryo; e.g., chromosomal
abnormalities, genetic abnormalities, defects in the development of the placenta or embryo.
• The risk of miscarriage increases with increasing maternal age:
* 10% in women aged < 30 years.
* 15–20% in women aged 35–39 years.
* > 50% in women aged > 45 years.
• Risk of miscarriage reduces with increasing gestational age, with up to 75% of miscarriages occurring
before 12 weeks’ gestation.

• Psychological complications – grief, anxiety, or depression. Risk of more intense
or longer-lasting distress if the woman has:
* Strongly desired the pregnancy.
* Waited a long time to conceive.
* History of miscarriage or other pregnancy.
* Miscarriage later in the pregnancy.
* Limited social support.
* History of difficulty coping with distressing situations.
Be aware of the psychological sequelae associated with pregnancy loss and provide
support, follow-up, and access to formal counselling when necessary.

Differential diagnosis – bleeding in early pregnancy
Uterine causes

Clinical features
• Period of amenorrhoea/positive pregnancy test.
• Pain and/or bleeding.
• Threatened miscarriage – scanty vaginal bleeding, varying from a brownish discharge to bright red
bleeding. Lower abdominal cramping pain or lower backache usually develops after the onset of
bleeding. Tenderness of the abdomen or pelvis may be present. Cervical os is closed.
• Inevitable miscarriage – same symptoms as threatened miscarriage but more severe. Internal cervical os
is open or pregnancy tissue may be found to be coming through the os.
• Complete miscarriage – resolving symptoms and signs of a miscarriage.
• Delayed miscarriage – may present with resolving symptoms of pregnancy in women with no pain
or bleeding. Fetal heartbeat is undetectable and the uterus may be small for dates. May be found
incidentally during a routine ultrasound assessment of pregnancy.

• Ectopic pregnancy:
* Cardiovascular shock.
* Fainting.
* Shoulder-tip pain.
* Abdominal pain.
* Abdominal tenderness on examination.
* Cervical tenderness.
• Molar pregnancy:
* Absent fetal heart sounds.
* Heavy and prolonged bleeding.
* Symptoms of pregnancy are exaggerated.
* Uterus is large for dates.
* Vesicles may be passed vaginally.
• Intrauterine pregnancy.

Extrauterine causes

•
•
•
•

Urethral bleeding.
Cervical ectropion.
Cervical polyps.
Gynaecological cancers.

Clinical

Ultrasound-based

Gestational age

Inevitable – when bleeding is associated with an open cervix. However, pregnancy may continue
successfully in women diagnosed to have an open cervix; therefore, aim for expectant management.
Threatened – vaginal bleeding and/or pain with viable pregnancy and closed cervix.
Incomplete – when all the pregnancy tissue has not been expelled from the uterus and bleeding may
or may not be present.
Complete – when all the pregnancy tissue has been expelled and bleeding has stopped.
Delayed/missed miscarriage/anembryonic pregnancy/early fetal demise – when the pregnancy has
failed but there is no bleeding, and pregnancy tissues have not been expelled.

Pregnancy of unknown location – no identifiable pregnancy
on scan, with positive hCG.
Fetal loss – previous CRL measurement with subsequent loss
of fetal heart activity.
Empty sac – gestational sac with absent or minimal structures.
Biochemical pregnancy loss – pregnancy not located on the scan.
Delayed/missed miscarriage/anembryonic pregnancy/early
fetal demise.

Early miscarriage – the spontaneous loss of a pregnancy
before 12 weeks’ gestation.
Late miscarriage – loss of fetal
heart activity after 12 completed
weeks.

http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/CBO9781316156513.002

Investigations

TAS – enlarged uterus or other pelvic pathology; e.g.,
fibroids or ovarian cyst, or if TVS is unacceptable.

TAS/TVS – assess the location and viability of the pregnancy

Pregnancy of unknown location –- no signs of either intra- or extrauterine p
­ regnancy
or retained pregnancy tissue in a woman with a positive pregnancy test. Incidence:
8–10%.

Pregnancy of known location

Intrauterine pregnancy (IUP)

Visible fetal heartbeat – viable IUP

Ectopic pregnancy

No visible fetal heartbeat on TVS – uncertain viability

If the fetal pole is visible, measure the
crown–rump length (CRL).

CRL < 7.0 mm

CRL ≥ 7.0 mm

Perform a second scan a minimum of 7 days
after the first scan.

• Diagnosis of miscarriage using one USS is not 100% accurate;
there is a small chance that the diagnosis may be incorrect,
particularly at very early gestational ages.
• Do not use gestational age from the LMP alone to determine
whether a fetal heartbeat should be visible, as LMP may not
give an accurate representation of gestational age because of
variability in the menstrual cycle.

3

See Chapter 5: Ectopic pregnancy

If the fetal pole is not visible, measure the mean
gestational sac diameter (MSD).

MSD < 25.0 mm

MSD ≥ 25.0 mm

• Seek a second opinion.
• Delayed miscarriage.

When diagnosing complete miscarriage on USS,
in the absence of a previous scan confirming
an IUP, be aware of the possibility of ectopic
pregnancy.

• Viable IUP.
• Complete miscarriage.
• Incomplete/missed miscarriage.

SECTION 1

Early pregnancy care

Management

Outpatient – refer women with a threatened or suspected incomplete/delayed miscarriage to an early pregnancy assessment unit (EPAU) for confirmation of the diagnosis.
Inpatient – refer women with severe pain or bleeding, or who are shocked for immediate admission to hospital.

General measures

Service provision

• Threatened miscarriage (vaginal bleeding and a confirmed viable IUP):
* If her bleeding gets worse, or persists beyond 14 days, return for further assessment.
* If the bleeding stops, start or continue routine ANC.
• Medical/expectant management – can be offered only in units where women can access
24-hour telephone advice and emergency admission, if required. Protocols with selection
criteria, therapeutic regimens, and arrangements for follow-up should be in place.
• Encourage patient choice – associated with positive quality-of-life outcomes.
• Screen for infections – including Chlamydia trachomatis, in women undergoing SMM.
• Histology of the tissue obtained at the time of miscarriage to confirm pregnancy and to
exclude ectopic pregnancy or unsuspected GTD.
• NICE – anti-D rhesus prophylaxis at a dose of 250 IU (50 µg) to all rhesus-negative
women who have a surgical procedure to manage an ectopic pregnancy or a miscarriage.
• NICE – do not offer anti-D rhesus prophylaxis to women who:
* Receive solely medical management for an ectopic pregnancy or miscarriage.
* Have a threatened miscarriage.
* Have a complete miscarriage.
* Have a pregnancy of unknown location.

Early pregnancy loss accounts for over 50,000 admissions in the UK annually.
Outpatient EPAU service – hospital admission can be avoided in 40% of women, with a
further 20% requiring a shorter hospital stay.
NICE – EPAU services should be:
• Available – 7 days a week.
• Accessibility – direct access for GPs and selected patient groups. EPAU should accept
self-referrals from women who have had a recurrent miscarriage or a previous ectopic or
molar pregnancy. All other women with pain and/or bleeding should be assessed by an
HCP (GP, A&E doctor, midwife, or nurse) before referral.
• Appropriate setting – ideally sited in a dedicated area.
• Appropriate staff – HCPs competent to diagnose and care for women with pain and/or
bleeding in early pregnancy, trained in sensitive communication and breaking bad news.
• Diagnostic and therapeutic algorithms.
• USS equipment and staff appropriately trained.
• Laboratory facilities – rhesus antibody testing, serial β-hCG with results available within
24 hours, progesterone estimation (NICE – only β-hCG).
• Standardized information leaflets, referral, and discharge letters, with clear plans for
follow-up.
• Access to formal counselling.
• Ensure that a system is in place to enable women referred to their local EPAU to attend
within 24 hours if the clinical situation warrants this.

http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/CBO9781316156513.002

Management options
Largely based on the woman’s preference, unless there are clinical indications for surgical intervention.

First-line option – expectant management (NICE)
A management approach in which treatment is not administered, with the aim of seeing
whether the condition will resolve naturally.
NICE – use expectant management for 7–14 days as the first-line management strategy for
women with a confirmed diagnosis of miscarriage.
• Advantages:
* Avoids hospitalization and risks of surgery.
* Reduction in clinical pelvic infection rates.
• Risks – Symptoms may take several weeks to resolve and, sometimes, surgical intervention is
required for failed cases.
• Most women will need no further treatment.
• Provide oral and written information about what to expect throughout the process, advice
on pain relief, where and when to get help in an emergency, and further treatment options.

• Resolution of bleeding and pain during 7–14
days suggests complete miscarriage. Advise a
urine pregnancy test after 3 weeks.
* Negative – complete miscarriage.
* Positive – return for individualized care.

• If after the period of 7–14 days the bleeding and pain:
* Have not started (miscarriage has not begun).
* Are persisting and/or increasing (incomplete
miscarriage).
• Repeat scan.
• Further treatment options – continued expectant, medical,
or surgical management.

• If the woman opts for continued expectant
management, review at a minimum of 14 days
after the first follow-up appointment.
Explore management options other than expectant management if:

• Woman is at increased risk of haemorrhage (late first trimester).
• History of adverse and/or traumatic experience associated with pregnancy (stillbirth,
miscarriage, or antepartum haemorrhage).
• Increased risk from the effects of haemorrhage (coagulopathies or is unable to have a blood
transfusion).
• There is evidence of infection.

5

• Factors that affect the success rates:
* Type of miscarriage (delayed or incomplete).
* Duration of follow-up.
* Serum progesterone levels.
• Highly effective in incomplete miscarriage.
• Success rates for delayed miscarriage for expectant vs surgical management are
28% and 81% and for incomplete miscarriage, the rates are 94% and 99%.
• Retained pregnancy tissue – genuine retained pregnancy tissue is less likely
to be confirmed histologically when USS shows heterogenous shadows with
a maximum AP diameter of ≤ 15 mm. These could include some cases of
incomplete miscarriage but are best managed conservatively as there is a trend
towards a lower complication rate compared with surgical management.

SECTION 1

Early pregnancy care

Medical management
• Offer medical management to women with a confirmed diagnosis of miscarriage if
expectant management is not acceptable. NICE
• Do not offer mifepristone as a treatment for missed or incomplete miscarriage.
• Offer vaginal/oral misoprostol for missed or incomplete miscarriage.
• Missed miscarriage – single dose of 800 µg of misoprostol.
• Incomplete miscarriage – single dose of 600 µg of misoprostol. (800 µg can be used as
an alternative to allow alignment of treatment protocols for both missed and incomplete
miscarriage).
• Offer all women pain relief and antiemetics as needed.
• Inform what to expect, including the length and extent of bleeding and the potential side
effects of treatment, including pain, diarrhoea, and vomiting.

• Bleeding commences and resolution of pain and bleeding – perform urine pregnancy.

Pregnancy test negative –
complete miscarriage.

• Advantages:
* Avoids the risks of operation and GA. * Feeling of being ‘more in control’.
* Outpatient basis. * Cost saving. * Reduction in clinical pelvic infection (7% vs 13%).
• Risks of increased pain and bleeding, persistent symptoms, and treatment failure requiring
surgical evacuation.
• Bleeding may continue for up to 3 weeks.
• Success rate – 84% of cases.
• Higher success rates with: * Incomplete miscarriage. * High-dose
misoprostol. * Prostaglandins administered vaginally. * Clinical follow-up without
routine USS.
• Delayed miscarriage – success rates are decreased.

• If bleeding has not started 24 hours after treatment, worsening symptoms – incomplete
miscarriage.

Medical review

Pregnancy test positive –
exclude molar or ectopic pregnancy.

Repeat USS and individualized care.

Surgical management

• Suction curettage – under local anaesthesia or sedation. Associated with statistically
significantly decreased blood loss, less pain, and shorter duration of procedure compared
to use of metal curette.
• Routine use of a metal curette after suction curettage is not required.
• Oxytocin use is associated with significantly less blood loss.
• Complications – perforation, cervical tears, intrauterine adhesions, intra-abdominal
trauma, and haemorrhage.
• Prostaglandin prior to surgical abortion – significant reductions in dilatation force,
haemorrhage, and uterine/cervical trauma. Oral/vaginal preparation.
• Manual vacuum aspiration technique under systemic analgesia is an option.
• Offer a choice of:
* Manual vacuum aspiration under local anaesthetic in an outpatient setting.
* Surgical management in a theatre, under GA.

• Advantage – symptoms resolve rapidly but has the disadvantage of risks associated with an
operation.
• Indications:
* Women’s preference.
* Where other treatments have failed.
* A medical indication (< 10% of women who miscarry).
* Excessive bleeding. * Haemodynamic instability.
* Infected retained tissue.
* Suspected GTD.
* Retained pregnancy tissue despite medical/expectant treatment.
• Non-surgical methods are associated with longer and/or heavier bleeding and a 15–50%
possibility of eventually needing surgical evacuation for clinical need or the woman’s
preference. However, non-surgical methods are also associated with a lower risk of infection
compared with surgery.

http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/CBO9781316156513.002

Follow-up
• Assess woman’s psychological wellbeing and offer counselling, if appropriate. Grief, anxiety, and depression are common following
miscarriage. Grief following miscarriage is comparable in nature, intensity, and duration to grief reactions in people suffering other
types of major loss. Distress is commonly at its worst 4–6 weeks after a miscarriage and may last 6–12 months.
• Menstruation can be expected to resume within 4–8 weeks of the miscarriage, but may take several cycles to re-establish a regular
pattern.
• For women who wish to become pregnant – they can do so as soon as they feel psychologically and physically ready.
• Offer pre-conception advice.
• For women who do not wish to become pregnant – advise on contraception immediately after the miscarriage.

Consent – surgical evacuation of the uterus for early pregnancy loss
(Surgical management of miscarriage)

Discuss

• Explain – removal of early pregnancy tissue from the uterus,
usually with suction. Cervix may need to be dilated to allow
emptying of the uterine contents.
• Intended benefit – to treat an incomplete or delayed
miscarriage, or retained placental tissue.
• Discuss alternative treatment options: medical and expectant
management, particularly for women without an intact sac.
• If tissue is sent for histology, the reasons (to exclude ectopic
or molar pregnancy) should be explained.
• Form of anaesthesia.

• Serious risks:
* Serious morbidity – 2.1% with a mortality of
0.5/100,000.
* Uterine perforation – up to 5/1000.
* Significant trauma to the cervix (rare).
* No substantiated evidence of any impact on future
fertility.
• Frequent risks:
* Bleeding that lasts for up to 2 weeks is very common but
blood transfusion is uncommon (1.2/1000).
* Need for repeat surgical evacuation – up to 5/100.
* Localized pelvic infection – 3/100 women.

Guideline comparator
• Anti-D immunoglobulin (RCOG) - non-sensitized rhesus (Rh)-negative women
should receive it in cases of:
* Ectopic pregnancy.
* All miscarriages > 12 weeks of gestation (including threatened).
* All miscarriages where the uterus is evacuated (medically or surgically).
* It should only be given for threatened miscarriage under 12 weeks gestation,
when bleeding is heavy or associated with pain.
* It should be given in any case where there is clinical doubt.

SECTION 1

Early pregnancy care

CHAPTER 2 Care of patients requesting termination of pregnancy

Service provision

Prevalence and incidence
• About one third of women have a TOP by the age of 45 years in the UK.
• Most commonly performed gynaecological procedure in the UK, with around 200,000 terminations
performed annually in England and Wales and around 11,500 in Scotland.
• Over 98% of TOPs in the UK are undertaken because of the risk to the mental or physical health of the
woman or her children. Remaining done for fetal abnormality.

History
• Take detailed history to identify those who require more support in decision making (such as psychiatric
history, poor social support, or evidence of coercion).
• Assess risk for STIs and screening for Chlamydia.

Investigations
•
•
•
•

Haemoglobin.
ABO and rhesus blood groups.
Screening for red cell antibodies.
HIV, hepatitis B and C, and haemoglobinopathies – indicated in the light of clinical features, individual risk
factors, or local prevalence.
• Cervical smear.
• USS – not essential prerequisite in all cases. Undertake where gestation is in doubt or extrauterine
pregnancy is suspected.

Prevention of infective complications

• Ideally, test for lower genital tract organisms with treatment of positive cases.
• Minimum – antibiotic prophylaxis.
• Regimens for peri-TOP prophylaxis:
* Metronidazole, 1 g rectally at the time of TOP plus doxycycline, 100 mg orally BD for 7 days,
commencing on the day of abortion.
* Metronidazole, 1 g rectally at the time of TOP plus azithromycin, 1 g orally on the day of TOP.
* Metronidazole, 1 g rectally or 800 mg orally, prior to or at the time of TOP for women tested negative
for Chlamydia.

• The earlier in the pregnancy a TOP is performed, the lower the risk of
complications.
• Service arrangements should be such that:
* Referral to abortion services should be made within 2 days.
* Assessment appointment should be within 5 days of referral.
* Offer abortion procedure within 5 working days of decision to proceed.
* Total time from seeing the abortion provider to the procedure should not
exceed 10 working days.
• Care pathways for additional support – access to social services and access to
services for women with special needs.
• Information and support for those who consider but do not proceed.
• Maintain confidentiality.
• May be managed on a day-case basis.
• Inpatient beds must be available for women who are unsuitable for day case
(up to 5%).
• Should be cared for separately from other gynaecological patients.
• Second-trimester TOP – must be cared for by experienced midwife or nurse.

Information to women

• Adapt national information to reflect local circumstances.
• Possible complications:
* Haemorrhage requiring blood transfusion – 1/1000 in early gestation
increasing to 4/1000 in gestation beyond 20 weeks.
* Uterine perforation 1–4/1000.
* Uterine rupture (mid-trimester medical TOP) < 1/1000.
* Cervical trauma – no greater than 1/100.
* Failed abortion – < 1/100 (surgical = 2.3/1000; medical =1–14/1000).
* Need for further intervention (surgical intervention following medical
termination or repeat evacuation following surgical termination) – < 5%.
* Post-abortion infection – 10%.
• No proven associations between induced abortion and subsequent ectopic
pregnancy, placenta praevia, or infertility.
• May be associated with a small increase in the risk of subsequent PTD, which
increases with number of abortions.
• Termination regimens containing misoprostol are not licensed. Inform women if
a prescribed treatment is unlicensed.

http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/CBO9781316156513.003

Method of TOP

Service standards

• Minimum – offer one of the recommended methods for each gestation band.
• Ideally – offer a choice of recommended methods for each gestation band.

• Consider cervical preparation in all women.
• Misoprostol 400 μg vaginally 3 hours/sublingually 2–3 hours prior to surgery.
• After 14 weeks, osmotic dilators provide superior dilatation to medical
methods; however, misoprostol is an alternative method up to 18 weeks.

Surgical management

Medical management
Mifepristone 200 mg and misoprostol.

9

Early medical abortion ≤ 63 days

9–13 weeks

13–24 weeks

• ≤ 63 days – mifepristone 200 mg orally followed
24–48 hours later by misoprostol 800 μg vaginally/
orally/sublingually.
• ≤ 49 days – mifepristone 200 mg orally followed
24–48 hours later by misoprostol 400 μg orally.
• 50–63 days – if abortion has not occurred 4 hours after
misoprostol, a second dose of misoprostol 400 μg may
be given orally/vaginally.
• It is safe for woman to leave the abortion unit following
misoprostol administration to complete the abortion
at home.

• Mifepristone 200 mg orally followed 36–48 hours
later by misoprostol 800 μg vaginally. A maximum of
4 further doses of misoprostol 400 μg may be given
3 hourly (orally/vaginally).

• Mifepristone 200 mg orally followed 36–48 hours
later by misoprostol 800 μg vaginally. A maximum of
4 further doses of misoprostol 400 μg may be given
3 hourly (orally/vaginally).
• If abortion does not occur, mifepristone can be repeated
3 hours after the last dose of misoprostol and, 12 hours
later, misoprostol may be commenced.
• Avoid routine surgical evacuation of the uterus
following medical TOP. Undertake only if there is
clinical evidence that the termination is incomplete.
• Perform feticide before medical TOP after 21 weeks and
6 days of gestation to ensure that there is no risk of a
live birth.

First trimester

Gestational age > 14 weeks

Vacuum aspiration

Dilatation and evacuation

•
•
•
•
•
•

• Dilatation and evacuation with cervical preparation is safe and effective
when undertaken by specialist practitioners.
• Continuous USS guidance during D&E is recommended.

< 7 weeks – vacuum aspiration but associated with a higher risk of failure.
7–14 weeks – vacuum aspiration.
14–16 weeks – vacuum aspiration may be performed with large-bore cannulae.
Use suction cannula and blunt forceps only. Avoid sharp curettage.
Safer under local anaesthesia than under GA; conscious sedation requires trained practitioners.
Electric or manual aspiration devices – both are effective and acceptable to women and
clinicians. Operating times are shorter with electric aspiration.

• Women having medical TOP, in whom successful abortion has not been confirmed at the time of
the procedure – offer follow-up to exclude continuation of pregnancy.
• Routine follow-up if woman wishes.
• Refer for further counselling if necessary.
• Do not scan routinely to screen women for incomplete abortion. Decide to evacuate the
uterus following incomplete abortion based on clinical signs and symptoms and not on USS
appearance.
• Contraception – discuss, offer, and initiate.
• IUCD can be inserted immediately following a first- or second-trimester TOP.
• Sterilization can be safely performed at the time of TOP. However, combined procedures are
associated with higher rates of failure and of regret on the part of the woman.

Know your drug

Mifepristone

Misoprostol

• Mechanism – anti-progesterone. It works by blocking the effects of progesterone.
• Indications:
* Medical TOP.
* Induction of labour in cases of IUD.
• Dose – 200 mg tablets. Used in combination with prostaglandins such as misoprostol.
• Side effects – diarrhoea, nausea, uterine contractions or cramps, vomiting, vaginal
bleeding, infection, stomach cramps.
• Uncommon: hypersensitivity reactions, lowered blood pressure, skin rash or rashes, fever,
general feeling of being unwell, headaches, rupture of the uterus, skin problems, toxic
epidermal necrolysis, urticaria, vasovagal reaction such as hot flushes, dizziness or chills,
toxic shock syndrome.

• Mechanism – a synthetic prostaglandin E1 analogue that causes cervical softening and
dilatation and uterine contractions.
• Indications:
* Medication TOP.
* Medical management of miscarriage.
* Induction of labour in cases of intrauterine death.
* Cervical ripening before surgical procedures – first-trimester surgical abortion, secondtrimester D&E, hysteroscopy.
* Treatment of postpartum haemorrhage.
* Cervical ripening and induction of labour for a viable fetus.
* To treat or prevent stomach and duodenal ulcers.
• Doses – 200–800 μg oral, vaginal, sublingual, buccal, or rectal.
• Side effects – nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, fever, and chills.
• Termination regimens containing misoprostol are not licensed; women should be
informed if a prescribed treatment is unlicensed.
• Misoprostol’s advantages over other synthetic prostaglandin analogues are its low cost,
long shelf life, lack of need for refrigeration, and worldwide availability.

What not to do

Early pregnancy care

CHAPTER 3 Recurrent first-trimester (≥ 3) and second-trimester (≥ 1) miscarriage

Risk factors

Definition and prevalence

• Cause of recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) remains unknown in the majority of women.
• Maternal and paternal age – risk of miscarriage is highest among couples where the woman
is > 35 years of age and the man > 40 years of age.
* Maternal age – advancing maternal age is associated with a decline in both the number
and quality of the remaining oocytes.
* The age-related risk of miscarriage – see graph.
• Advanced paternal age is also a risk factor for miscarriage.
• BMI – obesity increases the risk of both sporadic and RPL.

• First-trimester recurrent miscarriage (RM) – loss of 3 or more consecutive pregnancies.
• 1–2% of second-trimester pregnancies miscarry before 24 weeks of gestation.
• Approximately 15% of all clinical pregnancies end in pregnancy loss, with 3 or more losses
affecting 1–2% of women of reproductive age and 2 or more losses affecting around 5% of
women.

History
• Obstetric history – risk increases after each successive pregnancy loss, reaching approximately
40% after 3 consecutive pregnancy losses.
• Details of previous loses – gestational age, scan confirmation of fetal pole, painless or painful
loss especially in second trimester loss.
• Past history – diabetes or thyroid disorders, congenital or acquired thrombophilias.
• Heavy alcohol consumption is toxic to the embryo and the fetus. Even moderate consumption
of ≥ 5 units per week may increase the risk of sporadic miscarriage.
• Occupational history – working with or using video display terminals does not increase the risk
of miscarriage. The evidence on the effect of anaesthetic gases for theatre workers is conflicting.
• Maternal smoking and caffeine – associated with an increased risk of spontaneous miscarriage in
a dose-dependent manner. However, current evidence is insufficient to confirm this association.

Investigations and recommendations

Antiphospholipid antibodies (LAC/ACA)

Genetic factors

• Screen women with first-trimester RPL and women with one or more second-trimester miscarriage before
pregnancy.
• Two positive tests at least 6 weeks apart for either LAC or ACA of IgG and/or IgM class in medium or high
titre are necessary for diagnosis.

• Perform cytogenetic analysis of the products of conception on third and
subsequent miscarriage.
• Perform parental peripheral blood karyotyping of both partners in couples with
RPL where testing of products of conception reports an unbalanced structural
chromosomal abnormality.
• Current data suggest that routine karyotyping of couples with RPL cannot
be justified owing to the cost. Selective parental karyotyping may be more
appropriate when an unbalanced chromosome abnormality is identified in the
products of conception.

Uterine anomalies

• Offer pelvic USS for women with first-trimester RPL and women with one or more second-trimester
miscarriages.
• 2D USS and/or HSG can be used as an initial screening test.
• Combined hysteroscopy and laparoscopy and possibly 3D USS should be used for definitive diagnosis.
• Value of MRI scanning remains undetermined.
Cervical weakness

• Women with a history of second-trimester miscarriage and suspected cervical weakness who have not undergone
a history-indicated cerclage may be offered serial cervical sonographic surveillance.

Inherited thrombophilic defects

• Screen women with second-trimester miscarriage for inherited thrombophilias
including factor V Leiden, factor II (prothrombin) gene mutation, and protein S.

http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/CBO9781316156513.004

Risk factors

Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS)

Genetic

Endocrine factors

• APA are present in 15% of women with RPL.
• APS – antiphospholipid antibodies (APA) + adverse
pregnancy outcome or vascular thrombosis.
• APA – lupus anticoagulant (LAC), anticardiolipin
antibodies (ACA), and anti-B2 glycoprotein-I antibodies.
• Adverse pregnancy outcomes:
* ≥ 3 consecutive miscarriages < 10 weeks of gestation.
* ≥ 1 morphologically normal fetal loss > 10 weeks.
* ≥ 1 PTB < 34 weeks owing to placental disease.
• Mechanisms – inhibition of trophoblastic function and
differentiation, activation of complement pathways at the
maternal–fetal interface resulting in a local inflammatory
response and in later pregnancy, thrombosis of the
uteroplacental vasculature.
• LBR with no medical intervention is as low as 10%.

• Parental structural chromosomal anomaly –
2–5% of couples. Most commonly a balanced
reciprocal or Robertsonian translocation.
* Carriers are phenotypically normal, but their
pregnancies are at increased risk of miscarriage
and may result in a live birth with multiple
congenital anomalies.
* Risk of miscarriage is influenced by the
size and genetic content of the rearranged
chromosomal segments.
• Embryonic chromosomal abnormalities – account
for 30–57% of further miscarriages. Risk
increases with advancing maternal age.

• Diabetes and thyroid disorders – women with uncontrolled diabetes in
the first trimester are at risk of miscarriage. Well-controlled diabetes
mellitus and treated thyroid dysfunction are not risk factors for RPL.
• Anti-thyroid antibodies – women with RPL are no more likely than
women without RPL to have circulating thyroid antibodies.
• PCOS – possible increased risk of miscarriage but the exact mechanism
remains unclear. The increased risk is attributed to insulin resistance,
hyperinsulinaemia, and hyperandrogenaemia. The prevalence of insulin
resistance is increased in women with RPL compared with fertile
controls.
* Polycystic ovarian morphology, elevated LH levels, or elevated
serum testosterone levels do not predict an increased risk of future
pregnancy loss.
* Elevated free androgen index appears to be a prognostic factor for a
subsequent miscarriage in women with RPL.

Immune factors

Anatomical factors

Infective agents

• No evidence to support the hypothesis of human
leucocyte antigen (HLA) incompatibility between
couples.
• Natural killer (NK) cells – peripheral blood NK
cells are phenotypically and functionally different
from uterine NK cells. No evidence that altered
peripheral blood NK cells are related to RPL.

• Congenital uterine malformations – risk of RPL
is unclear and the association is debatable.
Prevalence of uterine anomalies in RPL – 2–38%.
Prevalence is higher in women with secondtrimester miscarriages compared with women
who suffer first-trimester miscarriages.
• Cervical weakness – recognized cause of secondtrimester miscarriage. The true incidence
is unknown, as the diagnosis is essentially
clinical, based on a history of second-trimester
miscarriage preceded by spontaneous rupture of
membranes or painless cervical dilatation.

• Any severe infection that leads to bacteraemia or viraemia can cause sporadic
miscarriage.
• TORCH – for an infective agent to be implicated in the aetiology of RPL, it must
be capable of persisting in the genital tract and avoiding detection, or must
cause insufficient symptoms to disturb the woman. Toxoplasmosis, rubella,
cytomegalovirus, herpes, and Listeria infections do not fulfil these criteria.
• Bacterial vaginosis:
* BV in the first trimester has been reported as a risk factor for second-trimester
miscarriage and PTD, but the evidence for an association with first-trimester
miscarriage is inconsistent.
* Treatment of BV with oral clindamycin early in the second trimester
significantly reduces the incidence of second-trimester miscarriage and PTD.
* No published data to assess the role of antibiotic therapy in women with a
previous second-trimester miscarriage.

Inherited thrombophilic defects

• Activated protein C resistance (factor V Leiden mutation), deficiencies of protein C/S and antithrombin III,
hyperhomocysteinaemia, and prothrombin gene mutation.
• Possible cause of RPL and late pregnancy complications owing to thrombosis of the uteroplacental
circulation.
• Association between inherited thrombophilias and fetal loss varies according to type of thrombophilia.
• Association between thrombophilia and late pregnancy loss has been consistently stronger than for early
pregnancy loss.

13

CHAPTER 3

Male factor – increasing evidence suggests that abnormal integrity (intactness)

of sperm DNA may affect embryo development and possibly increase
miscarriage risk. However, these data are still very preliminary, and it is not
known how often sperm defects contribute to RPL. (ASRM)

SECTION 1

Management

Early pregnancy care

• Experienced clinician.
• Recurrent miscarriage clinic.

		
Antiphospholipid syndrome

Genetic

• Consider low-dose aspirin and heparin – significantly
reduces the miscarriage rate by 54%.
• Heparin – maternal complications: bleeding,
hypersensitivity reactions, thrombocytopenia, osteopenia,
and vertebral fractures on long-term use.
• Careful antenatal surveillance, as these pregnancies
remain at high risk of complications during all three
trimesters, including miscarriage, PET, FGR, and PTB.
• Neither corticosteroids nor IV immunoglobulin improve the
LBR of women with RPL associated with APA; their use
may provoke significant maternal and fetal morbidity.

• Refer to geneticist – counsel regarding:
* Prognosis for future pregnancy (5–10% risk of
unbalanced translocation).
* Familial chromosomal studies.
* Appropriate prenatal diagnosis.
• Reproductive options:
* Further natural pregnancy with or without a prenatal
diagnosis test.
* Gamete donation.
* Adoption.
• Preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) – technically
demanding and necessitates IVF; low LBR.
• 50–70% chance of a healthy live birth in future natural
pregnancies than after PGD ( ≈ 30%).

Inherited thrombophilias

Endocrine factors

Infective agents

• Insufficient evidence to evaluate the effect of heparin to
prevent a miscarriage in women with first-trimester RPL
associated with inherited thrombophilia.
• Heparin therapy during pregnancy may improve the LBR
of women with second-trimester miscarriage associated
with inherited thrombophilias.

• Insufficient evidence on the effect of progesterone
supplementation, hCG, and metformin to prevent
miscarriage.
• PCO morphology does not predict an increased risk of
miscarriage among ovulatory women with a history of
RPL who conceive naturally. Pre-pregnancy suppression
of high LH levels among ovulatory women with RPL and
PCO who hypersecrete LH does not improve live birth rate.
• Insufficient evidence to assess the effect of
hyperprolactinaemia as a risk factor.

• Screening for and treatment of bacterial vaginosis in
early pregnancy among high-risk women with a previous
history of second-trimester miscarriage or spontaneous
preterm labour may reduce the risk of recurrent late loss
and preterm birth.

Immune factors

• Immunotherapy, e.g., paternal cell immunization, thirdparty donor leucocytes, trophoblast membranes, and
intravenous immunoglobulin do not improve LBR.
• Immunotherapy is expensive and has potential serious
side effects – transfusion reaction, anaphylactic shock,
and hepatitis.
• Do not offer immune treatments routinely outside formal
research studies.

Anatomical factors

Unexplained recurrent miscarriage

• Congenital uterine malformations – insufficient evidence to assess the effect of uterine septum resection in
women with RPL to prevent further miscarriage.
• Open uterine surgery – complications of postoperative infertility and significant risk of uterine scar
rupture in pregnancy. These are less likely with hysteroscopic surgery.
• Cervical weakness – cervical cerclage – risks related to the surgery and the risk of stimulating uterine
contractions and miscarriage; therefore, consider only in women who are likely to benefit.
* In women with a singleton pregnancy and a history of one second-trimester miscarriage attributable
to cervical factors – offer an ultrasound-indicated cerclage, i.e., if a cervical length of ≤ 25 mm is
detected by TVS before 24 weeks of gestation.
* Transabdominal cerclage – in selected women with previous failed transvaginal cerclage and/or a
very short and scarred cervix. Abdominal cerclage may be associated with a lower risk of perinatal
death or delivery before 24 weeks of gestation, but it may be associated with a higher risk of serious
operative complications.

• Women with unexplained RPL have an excellent prognosis for future pregnancy
outcome without any intervention. Supportive care in the setting of a dedicated
EPAU – 75% achieve a successful future pregnancy.
• Prognosis worsens with increasing maternal age and the number of previous
miscarriages.
• Aspirin alone or in combination with heparin is being prescribed for women
with unexplained RPL; neither of these interventions has been shown to improve
the LBR among women with unexplained RPL. Do not empirically treat women
with unexplained RPL.

Tests not recommended
•
•
•
•
•

•
•

Management not recommended

MRI for uterine anomalies – value of MRI remains undetermined.
Routine karyotyping of couples with RPL cannot be justified owing to the cost.
Human leucocyte antigens – maternal leucocytotoxic antibodies or maternal blocking antibodies.
Cervical weakness – no satisfactory objective test that can identify women with cervical weakness
in the non-pregnant state; the diagnosis is essentially a clinical one.
Blood NK cells – testing for peripheral blood NK cells as a surrogate marker of the events at the
maternal–fetal interface is inappropriate.
Cytokines – routine cytokine tests outside research context.
TORCH screening.
Antithyroid antibodies – routine screening for thyroid antibodies.
Screening for occult diabetes and thyroid (GTT, TFT) in asymptomatic women.

• Corticosteroids and IV immunoglobulins in APA.
• Uterine septum resection, hCG, metformin, and progesterone supplementation.
• Prepregnancy suppression of high LH levels among ovulatory women with RPL and
polycystic ovaries who hypersecrete LH.
• Heparin to prevent a miscarriage associated with inherited thrombophilia.

SECTION 1

Early pregnancy care

CHAPTER 4 Gestational trophoblastic disease and neoplasia

• GTD – group of disorders ranging from complete and partial molar pregnancy to the malignant
conditions of invasive mole, choriocarcinoma, and placental site trophoblastic tumour (PSTT). 1/714
live births. Higher incidence in Asian women. • GTN – any evidence of persistence of GTD, most
commonly defined as a persistent elevation of β-hCG. Persistent GTN may develop after a molar
pregnancy, a non-molar pregnancy, or a live birth.

History
• Majority present with symptoms of early pregnancy failure – irregular vaginal bleeding, hyperemesis.
• Presentation with early severe PET, abdominal distension due to theca lutein cysts and
hyperthyroidism is rare.
• Very rarely – acute respiratory failure or neurological symptoms such as seizures due to metastatic
disease.

• Complete moles:
* Diploid and androgenetic – usually due to duplication of the haploid sperm
following fertilization of an ‘empty’ ovum (75–80%).
* Some due to dispermic fertilization of an ‘empty’ ovum (20–25%).
* No evidence of fetal tissue.
• Partial moles:
* Triploid – two sets of paternal haploid genes and one set of maternal haploid
genes (90%) due to dispermic fertilization of an ovum.
* Tetraploid or mosaic conceptions – 10%.
* Usually evidence of fetal tissue or fetal RBCs.

Examination – excessive uterine enlargement

Investigations
• Urine pregnancy test.
• Serum hCG levels greater than two multiples of the median may help.
• USS is helpful in making a diagnosis but the definitive diagnosis is by histopathology of pregnancy
tissues.

Management – evacuation
•
•
•
•

Suction evacuation is the method of choice.
Experienced surgeon to manage excessive vaginal bleeding.
Preparation of the cervix immediately before evacuation is safe.
Avoid prolonged cervical preparation, particularly with prostaglandins, to reduce the risk of
embolization of trophoblastic cells.
• Use of oxytocic infusion before completion of the evacuation is not recommended.
• Where possible, commence oxytocic infusion only once evacuation is completed.

Persisting symptoms such as vaginal bleeding after initial evacuation

• hCG, USS.
• Consult with the trophoblastic screening centre before repeat surgical intervention.
• Routine repeat evacuation is not warranted.

• Early complete molar pregnancy:
* Commonly associated with the USS diagnosis of delayed miscarriage or
anembryonic pregnancy.
• Partial molar pregnancy:
* USS has limited value in detecting as it is more complex. Finding of multiple
soft markers, including both cystic spaces in the placenta and a ratio of
transverse to AP dimension of the gestation sac of > 1.5 is required for a reliable
diagnosis. (RCOG)

• Complete molar pregnancies:
* Suction curettage is the method of choice of evacuation.
* Avoid medical termination if possible.
* Anti-D is not required in complete molar pregnancies because of poor
vascularization of the chorionic villi and absence of the anti-D antigen.
• Partial molar pregnancies:
* Suction curettage is the method of choice except when the size of the fetal parts
deters the use of suction curettage, when medical evacuation can be used.
* Anti-D to Rh-negative women.
Evidence – data with mifepristone and misoprostol are limited – avoid, as it
increases the sensitivity of the uterus to prostaglandins.

http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/CBO9781316156513.005

Histological examination
• Perform histological examination of all pregnancy tissues obtained after evacuation (medical or surgical).
• There is no need to routinely send pregnancy tissues for histological examination following TOP, provided that
fetal parts have been identified on prior USS.
• Ploidy status and immunohistochemistry staining for P57 may help in distinguishing partial from complete moles.

Monitoring/follow-up
• Register women with trophoblastic screening centre for follow-up.
• If hCG has reverted to normal within 56 days of the pregnancy, follow-up for 6 months from the date of
evacuation.
• If hCG has not reverted to normal within 56 days of the pregnancy, follow-up for 6 months from normalization of
the hCG level.

Risk of recurrence

Contraception

• Risk of a further molar pregnancy is low (1/80).
• > 98% of women who become pregnant following a molar pregnancy will not have a
further mole or be at increased risk of obstetric complications.
• If a further molar pregnancy does occur, in 68–80% of cases it will be of the same
histological type.
• After the conclusion of any further pregnancy, at any gestation and outcome, advise
women to notify the trophoblastic screening centre. Urine or blood hCG levels are
measured 6–8 weeks after the end of the pregnancy to exclude disease recurrence.

• Advise women not to conceive until the hCG level has been normal for 6 months.
• Advise women who undergo chemotherapy not to conceive for one year after
completion of treatment.
• Advise women to use barrier methods of contraception until hCG levels revert to
normal.
• COC pill and HRT are safe to use after hCG levels have reverted to normal.
• There is no evidence on whether single-agent progestogens have any effect on GTN.
• COC pill, if taken while hCG levels are raised – there is a potential increased risk of
developing GTN.
• Do not use IUCD until hCG levels are normal, to reduce the risk of uterine perforation.
• Small potential risk of use of emergency hormonal contraception, in women with raised
hCG levels, outweighs the potential risk of a pregnancy.

Twin pregnancy with one viable fetus and the other a molar pregnancy

• Refer to regional fetal medicine unit and the trophoblastic screening centre.
• Consider prenatal invasive testing for fetal karyotype in cases:
* Where it is unclear if the pregnancy is a complete mole with a coexisting normal
twin or a partial mole.
* Of abnormal placenta, such as suspected mesenchymal hyperplasia of the placenta.

17

• Increased risk of PNM and morbidity – approximately 25% chance of a live birth along
with increased risk of early fetal loss (40%) and premature delivery (36%).
• Incidence of PET is variable: 4–20%.
• Outcome for GTD:
* No increased risk of developing GTN after such a twin pregnancy.
* Pregnancy outcome after chemotherapy is unaffected.

SECTION 1

Early pregnancy care

Persistent GTN
• Persistent vaginal bleeding after a pregnancy event is the most common presenting symptom.
• Symptoms from metastatic disease, such as dyspnoea or abnormal neurology, occur very rarely.

A urine pregnancy test to exclude persistent GTN
Urgent referral to specialist centre

Placental site trophoblastic tumour is recognized as a variant of
GTN. It may be treated with surgery as it is less sensitive to
chemotherapy.

FIGO staging

The need for chemotherapy following:
• A complete mole is 15%.
• A partial mole is 0.5 %.

• Scoring six or less (low risk).
* IM methotrexate (MTX).
* Resistance to MTX – use combined dactinomycin and etoposide.

• Scoring seven or more (high risk).
* Combination chemotherapy – IV etoposide, methotrexate, dactinomycin, vincristine,
and cyclophosphamide (EMA-CO).

• Continue treatment in all cases, until the hCG level has returned to normal and then for a further 6 weeks.
• Prognosis for women with GTN after non-molar pregnancy may be worse (21% mortality after a live birth, 6% after a non-molar miscarriage) and, in part, is due to
delay in diagnosis.
• Women who receive chemotherapy are likely to have an earlier menopause.
• Women who require multi-agent chemotherapy (including etoposide) may be at increased risk of developing secondary cancers.

What not to do
• There is a theoretical concern over the routine use of potent oxytocic agents owing to the
potential to embolize and disseminate trophoblastic tissue. Therefore:
* Avoid prolonged cervical preparation, particularly with prostaglandins.
* Do not use oxytocic infusion prior to completion of the evacuation.
• Avoid medical termination, if possible.
• In complete molar pregnancies, anti-D is not required because of poor vascularization of
the chorionic villi and absence of the anti-D antigen.
• Routine repeat evacuation is not warranted.
• Advise women not to conceive until the hCG level has been normal for 6 months.
• Advise women who undergo chemotherapy, not to conceive for one year after
completion of treatment.
• Avoid COC while hCG levels are raised.
• Do not use intrauterine contraceptive devices until hCG levels are normal.

CHAPTER 5 Ectopic pregnancy
Pregnancy outside the uterine cavity

•
•
•
•

Prevalence and incidence

Risk factors

Incidence (static in recent years) – 1% of pregnancies.
Maternal mortality of 0.2/1000 estimated ectopic pregnancies.
Sites – tubal (98%); others – abdomen, ovary, cervix, caesarean section scar.
Heterotopic pregnancy – combination of both an IUP and an extrauterine pregnancy;
occurs in 1/4000 natural pregnancies and in about 1/100 pregnancies following assisted
reproduction.

• Conditions that damage the fallopian tube, impair its ability to transport gametes or embryos,
and predispose to faulty implantation.
• Risk factors for ectopic pregnancy:
* Prior pelvic or abdominal surgery.
* History of an STI, previous elective TOP, history of infertility, history of PID, previous
ectopic pregnancy, or history of IUCD.
* Prior tubal surgery or endometriosis.
* About a third of women have no known risk factors.

History

Risks or complications

• Amenorrhoea. Women may appear not to have missed a menstrual period, as vaginal
bleeding may occur at the time of the expected period.
• Pain or bleeding between 5 and 14 weeks’ gestation.
• Lower abdominal or pelvic pain – mild to severe; often unilateral.
• Vaginal bleeding – usually intermittent, bright or dark red, rarely exceeds the normal
menstrual flow.
• Beware of uncommon symptoms – fainting or dizziness, breast tenderness,
gastrointestinal symptoms (vomiting or diarrhoea), shoulder-tip pain (referred pain due
to peritoneal irritation), urinary symptoms, passage of tissue, rectal pressure or pain on
defecation.
• Asymptomatic – found incidentally on an early pregnancy scan.

• Tubal rupture (time of rupture depends on the site of implantation and usually occurs after
6 weeks) – intra-abdominal bleeding, shock.
• Death is rare but the leading cause of pregnancy-related death in the first trimester.
• Tubal infertility.
• Psychological – grief, anxiety, or depression. Distress is commonly at its worst 4–6 weeks after
pregnancy loss and may last 6–12 months.

Prognosis if untreated
• Spontaneous tubal miscarriage – occurs in about 50% of ectopic pregnancies and the woman may
have no symptoms. Some spontaneous tubal abortions may bleed, but the bleeding is self-limiting.
• Ruptured ectopic – intra-abdominal bleeding, shock, death.
• Chronic ectopic pregnancy.

Examination
• General examination – cardiovascular shock in cases of ruptured ectopic.
• Abdominal examination – tenderness, rebound tenderness, guarding, rigidity, or
distension.
• Vaginal examination – cervical and/or adnexal tenderness.
• Common signs – pelvic, adnexal, and abdominal tenderness.
• Other signs – cervical motion tenderness, rebound tenderness or peritoneal signs,
pallor, abdominal distension, enlarged uterus, tachycardia (> 100 beats per minute) or
hypotension (< 100/60 mmHg), shock or collapse, orthostatic hypotension.
• Advise not to perform a pelvic examination if a tubal rupture is suspected, as it is usually
difficult and information gained is limited because of generalized haemoperitoneum and
pain. It could cause total rupture of the ectopic pregnancy and it may delay management.

19

Differential diagnosis

SECTION 1

Early pregnancy care

NICE referral pathway – primary care setting
Assessment – history, examination, urine pregnancy test

• Women of reproductive age – offer a pregnancy test even when symptoms are
nonspecific.
• Beware of atypical symptoms.
• Exclude the possibility of ectopic pregnancy, even in absence of risk factors, because
about a third of women will have no known risk factors.

Women who are haemodynamically unstable, or
in whom there is significant concern about the
degree of pain or bleeding.

Positive pregnancy test
Investigations
• Urine pregnancy test – almost always positive. A negative pregnancy test
in a woman with clinical features of ectopic pregnancy does not absolutely
exclude an ectopic pregnancy; but does make the diagnosis highly unlikely.
In such cases, due to the rare possibility of a false-negative pregnancy test
result, repeat urine pregnancy test or perform serum β-hCG.
• Serum hCG – positive in pregnancy, posterior cranial fossa germ cell tumours,
and placental trophoblastic tumours.
• In multiple pregnancies, hCG levels are a little higher, requiring an extra 2 or
3 days for the sacs to become visible.
• hCG levels are a measurement of trophoblastic proliferation only and should
not be used for a confirmatory diagnosis. Final confirmation can be provided
only by either an USS or a negative pregnancy test.
• TVS – see Chapter 1: Early pregnancy bleeding and miscarriage.
• Colour Doppler has not been shown to increase the detection rates of ectopic
pregnancy when compared to 2D USS.
• Discriminatory zone – a serum hCG level (at which it is assumed that all
viable IUPs will be visualized by TVS) of 1000–2400 IU/L. It is dependent
upon the quality of the ultrasound equipment, hCG assay techniques in use,
the experience of the sonographer, prior knowledge of the woman’s risks and
symptoms, and the presence of physical factors such as uterine fibroids and
multiple pregnancies.

Pain and abdominal tenderness or pelvic tenderness, or cervical
motion tenderness.

No

Yes

• Pain.
• Pregnancy of ≥ 6 weeks.
• Pregnancy of uncertain gestation.

Expectant management

• Repeat urine pregnancy test after 7–10 days; reassess if positive.
• To return if their symptoms continue or worsen.

Urgent

Women who return with worsening symptoms and signs that could
suggest an ectopic pregnancy

Refer to EPAU/A&E
Service provision

• EPAU services – see Chapter 1: Early pregnancy bleeding and miscarriage.
• Offer counselling and provide clear information about the importance of
the possible need for further treatment, adverse effects with the treatment,
and compliance with follow-up.
• Offer anti-Dimmunoglobulin to non-sensitized women who are rhesus
negative with a confirmed or suspected ectopic pregnancy.

SECTION 1

Early pregnancy care

Management

Expectant management
Medical management

Pregnancy of unknown location

Ectopic pregnancy

• Patients – clinically stable
asymptomatic women with serum
hCG of 1000–1500 IU/L as the
upper limit, with minimal or no
symptoms, and 48–72 hours of
follow-up.
• 44–69% (2/3) resolve spontaneously
– these are small ectopic pregnancies,
which spontaneously resolve by
tubal abortion or early IUP that
miscarry.
• Active intervention (23–29% of
cases) if:
* Symptoms of ectopic pregnancy
occur.
* hCG levels rise above the
discriminatory level (1000/1500
IU/L).
* hCG levels start to plateau.

• Patients – clinically stable asymptomatic women with a USS diagnosis of
ectopic pregnancy, decreasing hCG levels that are < 1000 IU/L at initial
presentation, < 100 ml fluid in the pouch of Douglas, and adnexal mass of
< 4–5 cm.
• Successful in 67% (2/3) of women.
• Favourable outcome with lower initial hCG and a rapidly decreasing hCG
level, lack of an identifiable extrauterine gestational sac on TVS, and a
reduction in the average diameter of the adnexal mass by day 7.
• Follow-up:
* Twice weekly hCG and weekly TVS to ensure a rapidly decreasing hCG
level (ideally < 50% of its initial level within 7 days) and a reduction in
the size of adnexal mass.
* Thereafter, weekly hCG and TV USS until serum hCG levels are < 20 IU/L.
• Serum hCG of at least 1500 IU/L and < 5000 IU/L – offer the
choice of either surgery or MTX.
• Duration of follow-up, need for further doses of MTX, and
the likelihood of surgical intervention increase with hCG
concentration at presentation.

Laparoscopy • Patient – haemodynamically stable.
• Compared to laparotomy:
* Shorter operation times.
* Less intraoperative blood loss.
* Shorter hospital stay.
* Lower analgesic requirements.
• No difference in overall tubal patency rates, subsequent IUP
rates, and a trend towards lower repeat ectopic pregnancy rates.
Laparotomy • Haemodynamic instability – expedient resuscitation and surgery.
• Experienced operators may be able to manage women safely
laparoscopically, even with a large haemoperitoneum, but use
the surgical procedure that prevents further blood loss most
quickly. In most cases, this will be laparotomy.

Surgical management

• Outpatient treatment with MTX.
• Offer as first-line treatment to women who are able to return
for follow-up and who have all of the following: no significant
pain, an unruptured ectopic pregnancy with an adnexal mass
< 35 mm with no visible heartbeat, hCG level of < 1500 IU/L.
• Women with large adnexal masses are more likely to have
already ruptured, and the presence of cardiac activity in an
ectopic pregnancy is associated with a reduced chance of
success; therefore, do not use MTX.
• Follow-up – hCG levels on days 4 and 7 and give a further
dose if levels have failed to fall by >15%.
• About 14% require > one dose; 7% will experience tubal
rupture; < 10% require surgical intervention.
• Offer surgery as first-line treatment to women who are unable to
return for follow-up or have any of the following:
* Significant pain.
* Fetal heartbeat visible on TVS.
* Adnexal mass of ≥ 35 mm.
* hCG level of ≥ 5000 IU/L.
• Treatment with MTX is not acceptable.

Salpingectomy – offer to women with no risk factors for infertility.
• Urine pregnancy test after 3 weeks. To return for further assessment if the test is positive.
• Salpingotomy compared with salpingectomy – limited evidence. The IUP rates are similar but there is a trend towards higher
subsequent ectopic pregnancy with salpingotomy.
• Cohort studies show that in women with contralateral tubal disease, a trend towards a greater subsequent IUP following
laparoscopic salpingotomy compared with laparoscopic salpingectomy. There may be a higher subsequent IUP rate associated
with salpingotomy but the magnitude of this benefit may be small.
Salpingotomy – offer to women in the presence of contralateral tubal disease and the desire for future fertility. Compared to subsequent need for assisted conception, an IUP rate of 3% would make salpingotomy more cost-effective than salpingectomy. However:
• Higher rates of persistent trophoblast.
• Small risk of tubal bleeding in the immediate postoperative period, need for further treatment for persistent trophoblast, and a
risk of further ectopic pregnancies in the conserved tube.
• Up to 1/5 women may need further treatment: MTX and/or salpingectomy.
• Undertake one serum hCG measurement at 7 days after surgery, then one serum hCG measurement per week until a negative result
is obtained.

http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/CBO9781316156513.006

Follow-up

Persistent trophoblast

• Risk of recurrence – 8–14%. 25% in women with ≥ 2 previous ectopic pregnancies.
• Future fertility – about 60% of women who have had an ectopic pregnancy are able to
have a subsequent spontaneous IUP.
• Assess psychological wellbeing and offer counselling.
• Future pregnancies – patient should inform the GP as soon as she suspects she is pregnant,
for an early USS at 6–7 weeks to establish the location and viability of the pregnancy.
• Contraception – history of ectopic pregnancy is not a contraindication to any form of
hormonal contraception or IUD.
• Advise reliable contraception for 6 months post-treatment with MTX (teratogenic risk).

• Rate – 8.1–8.3% after laparoscopic salpingotomy and 3.9–4.1% after open salpingotomy.
• Increased risk in cases of high preoperative serum hCG levels (> 3000 IU/L), a rapid
preoperative rise in serum hCG, and the presence of active tubal bleeding.
• Can present with delayed haemorrhage.
• Diagnosis – failure of serum hCG levels to fall as expected after initial treatment.
• MTX single dose, if levels fail to fall as expected.
• Prophylactic MTX at the time of laparoscopic salpingotomy – when compared with simple
salpingotomy, there is a significant reduction in the rate of persistent trophoblast (1.9% vs 14%)
has been reported.

What not to do
• Pelvic examination if a tubal rupture is suspected.
• Medical management in women with large adnexal masses and presence
of cardiac activity in an ectopic pregnancy.
• Laparoscopy for haemodynamically unstable patient.
• Serum progesterone as an adjunct to diagnose either viable IUP or
ectopic pregnancy.

Evidence round-up
Surgical management compared with medical management using systemic MTX:
• Meta-analysis:
* No difference in success rate, in future pregnancy rates, and in recurrent ectopic pregnancy rates.
* Resolution time is shorter, need for further intervention is lower, and hospital stay is longer with surgical
management.
Laparoscopy vs laparotomy:
• Meta-analysis – no difference in the incidence of subsequent viable IUP, incidence of recurrent ectopic
pregnancy, need for further surgery; however, the length of hospital stay is longer with laparotomy.
• Incidence of abdominal pain, intraoperative blood loss, and need for a blood transfusion is higher with
laparotomy.
Salpingectomy vs salpingotomy:
• One study found that a subsequent live birth is significantly less likely with salpingectomy compared with
salpingotomy. A further 7 studies did not find a statistically significant difference in a subsequent live birth
between the two groups.
• For the recurrent ectopic pregnancy, there is a general trend that the incidence is lower with salpingectomy.
• For women without any coexistent fertility factors, future reproductive potential is unlikely to be strongly
affected by which mode of surgery is performed. However, for women with factors prognostic of infertility,
the evidence suggest that salpingotomy is associated with a higher chance of a subsequent IUP.

23

Know your drug – methotrexate
• Mechanism – anti-metabolite and anti-folate; acts by inhibiting the metabolism
of folic acid.
• Indications:
* Ectopic pregnancy.
* Gestational trophoblastic disease.
* Cancers.
* Autoimmune disease.
• Dose – a single IM injection (50 mg/m2).
• Side effects – nearly 75% experience abdominal pain. Differentiating so-called
‘separation pain’ owing to a tubal abortion from pain because of tubal rupture
can be difficult, and women may need to be admitted for observation and
assessment.
• Other side effects – conjunctivitis, stomatitis, and gastrointestinal upset.
• Advise – to avoid sexual intercourse during treatment and to use reliable
contraception for 3 months after MTX because of possible teratogenic risk.

SECTION 1

Early pregnancy care

CHAPTER 6 Hyperemesis gravidarum (HG)

Background and prevalence
• Nausea and vomiting of pregnancy affects at least 50% of women in the first trimester of
pregnancy. Symptoms usually begin between 5 and 6 weeks with peak severity around week 11,
and in 90% of women these symptoms resolve by week 16.
• HG – persistent vomiting in pregnancy, which leads to weight loss of > 5% of pre-pregnancy
weight with electrolyte imbalance and ketonuria. HG affects 1% of pregnant woman.
• Pathogenesis of HG is poorly understood and the aetiology is likely to be multifactorial.

Clinical features
• Severe and persistent nausea and vomiting leading to dehydration and weight loss.
• There may be ptyalism (inability to swallow saliva) and spitting.
• Signs of dehydration, tachycardia, and postural hypotension.

Risks or complications
Maternal

• Weight loss and muscle wasting.
• Mallory–Weiss tears and haematemesis.
• Thiamine deficiency – Wernicke’s encephalopathy – diplopia, abnormal ocular movements,
ataxia, and confusion. IV glucose may precipitate it. Thiamine replacement may improve the
symptoms but residual impairment is not uncommon.
• Korsakoff’s psychosis – retrograde amnesia, impaired ability to learn, and confabulation.
The recovery rate is only about 50%.
• Hyponatraemia – lethargy, seizures, respiratory arrest. Both severe hyponatraemia and
its rapid reversal may precipitate central pontine myelinolysis – spastic quadraparesis,
pseudobulbar palsy, and impaired consciousness.
• Other vitamin deficiencies – (cyanocobalamin and pyridoxine) can cause anaemia and
peripheral neuropathy.
• Maternal death.
Fetal – lower birth weight; fetal death in severe Wernicke’s encephalopathy.
Psychological impact

Differential diagnosis
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Urinary tract infection. • Hepatitis.
Appendicitis. • Cholecystitis.
Small bowel obstruction. • Pancreatitis.
Thyrotoxicosis, gestational thyrotoxicosis.
Hyperparathyroidism. • Diabetic ketoacidosis.
Uraemia. • Addison’s disease.
Iron supplementation.

•
•
•
•

Affects work and quality of life.
Depression.
Difficulties between partners.
In some, the condition is so intolerable that they elect to have a termination of pregnancy.

Evidence round-up

• Systematic review – women with HG during pregnancy are more likely to have
a baby with low birthweight and premature birth. There is no association with
Apgar scores, congenital anomalies, or perinatal death.

Management
Service provision – role of day-care units
Dietary and lifestyle changes – no evidence to prove the effectiveness of dietary changes on

relieving symptoms.
Non-pharmacological therapies

• Emotional support with frequent reassurance and encouragement.
• Psychotherapy, hypnotherapy, and behavioural therapy may be helpful.
• Ginger, alternative therapies, such as acupuncture and acupressure, may be beneficial.

• Advantages:
* Women can be discharged within 24 hours of admission.
* A study showed up to 88% patient satisfaction rate.
• Disadvantage:
* Misuse of the services.

http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/CBO9781316156513.007

Management – if no relief with conservative measures
Start pharmacological treatment as soon as possible.

Antihistamines

Pyridoxine

Ranitidine and omeprazole

• H1 receptor antagonists (dimenhydrinate, diphenhydramine, and
hydroxyzine) are considered safe in pregnancy, with no human
teratogenic potential.
• Consider them in the management of acute or breakthrough episodes
of HG.
• Avoid excessive dosing of H1 receptor antagonists by combining
different antihistamines in therapy.

• Effective in reducing nausea; no association with major
malformations.
• Pyridoxine monotherapy supplementation may be considered
as an adjuvant measure.
• Because the concerns about the possible toxicity of pyridoxine
in high doses have not yet been resolved, do not recommend
pyridoxine for the treatment for hyperemesis.

• Used primarily to reduce oesophageal acid
reflux associated with HG.
• No evidence of increased risk of congenital
malformations.

Dopamine antagonist phenothiazines

Metoclopramide

• Phenothiazines (chlorpromazine, perphenazine, prochlorperazine, promethazine,
trifluoperazine) have been proven to be safe for use in pregnancy.
• Phenothiazines are safe and effective for severe HG.

• There is no association between the drug exposure during the first
trimester and congenital malformations.
• Metoclopramide is safe to be used for management of HG, although
evidence for efficacy is limited.

If no improvement

Admission to hospital – any woman unable to maintain adequate hydration.

•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

25

Investigations

Urea and electrolytes (U&E) – hyponatraemia, hypokalaemia.
Raised haematocrit.
Metabolic hypochloraemic alkalosis; severe cases – acidaemia.
LFT – raised aminotransferase and bilirubin (frank jaundice is
rare).
Urinalysis – raised specific gravity and ketonuria.
Urine microscopy and culture (M&C) – exclude UTI.
USS – exclude molar or multiple pregnancy.
TFT – raised free T4, reduced TSH – self-limiting. Routine
TFT is questionable as clinical hyperthyroidism does not occur
and treatment is not required. It may provide an index of severity
of HG, as women with abnormal thyroid function usually require
longer hospitalization to avoid readmission.

Rehydration

Monitoring and others

• IV rehydration with normal saline or Hartmann’s solution.
• Potassium chloride with each bag of saline, particularly if there
is continued vomiting.
• Fluid and electrolyte regimens must be adapted daily and
titrated against daily measurements of serum sodium and
potassium.
• Avoid double strength saline solution even in cases of severe
hyponatraemia, as rapid correction of sodium depletion may
cause central pontine myelinolysis.
• Avoid solutions containing dextrose because they do not contain
enough sodium and may precipitate Wernicke’s encephalopathy.

• Weight, pulse, and BP.
• Discontinue drugs that may cause nausea and
vomiting (e.g., iron supplements) temporarily.
• Routine thiamine supplementation to prevent
Wernicke’s encephalopathy; oral/IV.
• Thromboprophylaxis (e.g., enoxaparin 40 mg
daily) and thromboembolic deterrent stockings.

SECTION 1

Early pregnancy care

If no improvement

Refractory – severe hyperemesis gravidarum

Ondansetron

Corticosteroid therapy

• The selective serotonin (5HT3) receptor antagonist ondansetron is
effective in some women with HG.
• Limited evidence on effectiveness.
• It may be safe to use during the first trimester, but the data are scant.
• Because of its limited effectiveness, do not offer as first-line, until
agents with established safety and effectiveness have been tried and
have failed.

• May produce a dramatic and rapid improvement; may need long-term therapy.
• Screening for the complications of steroid treatment in pregnancy, particularly UTI and GDM, is necessary.
• Recent case–control studies showed a small but significantly increased risk of oral clefting associated with firsttrimester exposure.
• Data on effectiveness are weak. Although a few controlled studies showed some effectiveness, pooled results of those
studies failed to show a reduction in the number of subsequent readmissions to hospital compared with controls.
• Until more data are available, use corticosteroids as the last line of therapy and only when maternal benefits outweigh
fetal risk.
• Avoid corticosteroids during the first trimester because of possible increased risk of oral clefting, and restrict its use to
refractory cases. (SOGC, ACOG)

If no improvement

Total parenteral nutrition

• Produces a rapid therapeutic effect.
• Recommended if optimal rehydration, antiemetic therapy, and a trial of corticosteroids and/or ondansetron have
failed to result in improvement.
• Risks – metabolic and infectious complications – line sepsis, bacterial endocarditis, and pneumonia.
• Strict protocol with careful monitoring is essential.

•
•
•
•

What not to do

Pyridoxine for the treatment for hyperemesis. (NICE)
Double-strength saline solution.
Solutions containing dextrose.
Corticosteroids during the first trimester should be restricted to
refractory cases because of possible increased risk of oral clefting.
(SOGC, ACOG)

Evidence round up
Cochrane review, 2010 – acupressure, acustimulation, acupuncture, ginger, vitamin B6, and several antiemetic drugs:

•
•
•
•
•

P6 acupressure, auricular acupressure, and acustimulation of the P6 point – limited evidence.
Acupuncture – no significant benefit.
Ginger products may be helpful, but the evidence of effectiveness is limited.
Limited evidence to support the use of vitamin B6 and antiemetic drugs to relieve mild or moderate nausea and vomiting.
Little information on maternal and fetal adverse outcomes on psychological, social, or economic outcomes.

SECTION 2

Disorders of menstruation

CHAPTER 7 Dysmenorrhoea

Prevalence and incidence

Risk factors

• The most common gynaecological symptom reported by women. It affects between 50% and
90% of menstruating women.
• It can lead to absence from school or work; 13–51% report having been absent and 5–14%
report being frequently absent.

•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Age – more pronounced in adolescents.
Early menarche, heavy and increased duration of menstrual flow.
Family history.
Nulliparity.
Smoking.
More frequent life changes, fewer social supports, and stressful close relationships.
Lower socioeconomic groups.
Obesity, physical activity, and alcohol – controversial.

History
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

To rule out secondary dysmenorrhoea and other causes of pelvic pain.
Menstrual history – age at menarche, length and regularity of cycles, duration and amount of the bleeding, IMB, PCB.
Length of time elapsed between menarche and beginning of dysmenorrhoea.
Pain – type, location, radiation, associated symptoms, chronology of the onset of pain in relation to menstrual bleeding.
Severity and duration of symptoms, the progression over time, and the degree of the patient’s disability.
Significant gastrointestinal symptoms or the presence of pelvic pain not related to the menstrual cycle.
Rectal pain and bleeding.
Sexual activity, dyspareunia, and contraception.
Gynaecological history – STIs, pelvic infection, infertility.
Pelvic/cervix surgery – cerclage, cryotherapy, or conization (cervical stenosis).
Any family history of endometriosis.
All types of therapy tried in the past.
Establish the impact of dysmenorrhoea on the woman’s life.

Investigations
Examination
•
•
•
•

To rule out the presence of any pelvic pathology.
Abdominal examination – any mass, tenderness.
Inspect – external genitalia to exclude an abnormality of the hymen.
Pelvic examination – when history is suggestive of organic disease or
when the patient does not respond to the conventional therapy.
• In the adolescent with a typical history of mild to moderate primary
dysmenorrhoea, who has never been sexually active – pelvic examination
is not necessary.

• USS:
* No evidence for the routine use of USS in the evaluation of primary dysmenorrhoea. May be helpful if
there is any abnormality on examination, dysmenorrhoea refractory to first-line therapy, adolescents in
whom a pelvic examination is not possible or unsatisfactory.
* USS cannot detect subtle signs of organic diseases such as uterosacral ligament tenderness or nodules
and cervical motion tenderness; therefore, will not replace a thorough bimanual examination.
• MRI – for adenomyosis, but this expensive test has limited clinical usefulness.
• Hysteroscopy and saline sonohysterography – for endometrial polyps and submucosal fibroids.
• Laparoscopy – a definite diagnosis of endometriosis, PID, or pelvic adhesions. Indicated when these
pathologies are strongly suspected or when first-line therapy has failed.

https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9781316156513

Differential diagnosis

• Primary dysmenorrhoea:
* Usually begins in adolescence after the establishment of
ovulatory cycles, therefore starts 6–12 months after the
menarche, once cycles are regular.
* Pain often starts shortly before the onset of menstruation, and
lasts for up to 72 hours, improving as the menses progresses.
* Other gynaecological symptoms are not usually present.
* Non-gynaecological symptoms may be present.
* Pelvic examination is normal.

• Secondary dysmenorrhoea:
* Menstrual pain associated with underlying pelvic pathology.
* Pain appears after several years of painless periods.
* Pain may persist after menstruation finishes, or may be
present throughout the menstrual cycle, but exacerbated by
menstruation.
* Other gynaecological symptoms are often present.
* Pelvic examination may be abnormal; however, the absence of
abnormal findings does not exclude secondary dysmenorrhoea.

• Endometriosis – cyclical or chronic pelvic pain that frequently occurs prior to menstruation and may be
accompanied by HMB and deep dyspareunia.
• Adenomyosis – painful menstruation that may be accompanied by HMB.
• Uterine myomas – lower abdominal pain, accompanied by HMB; a pelvic mass on examination.
• Endometrial polyps – Pedunculated submucosal fibroids and endometrial polyps may cause painful
menstrual cramps, and abnormal vaginal bleeding.
• Cervical stenosis
• Obstructive malformations of the genital tract – adolescents experiencing dysmenorrhoea in the first 6
months from the start of menarche, or in pubertal age in the case of concealed menstruation.

Management –

• Exercise, heat, behavioural interventions – data on the
effectiveness of such interventions are inconclusive and
controversial.
• Exercise – limited data to draw definitive conclusions.
• Behavioural interventions – biofeedback, desensitization,
hypnotherapy, and relaxation training. (Cochrane review,
2007) – some evidence to suggest that behavioural
therapies may be effective.
• Topical heat – low-level topical heat therapy is as
effective as ibuprofen – limited evidence.

29

• Other causes of pain:
* Chronic PID.
* Pelvic adhesions.
* Irritable bowel syndrome.
* Inflammatory bowel disease.
* Interstitial cystitis.
* IUD.
• Sudden dysmenorrhoea:
* Acute PID.

• PID – lower abdominal pain and tenderness that may be accompanied
by dyspareunia, abnormal vaginal bleeding, and abnormal vaginal
discharge. In acute infection, fever may be present.
• Intrauterine device – history of IUD insertion, usually 3–6 months
previously. Pain may be accompanied by longer and heavier periods,
often with bleeding or spotting between periods.

lifestyle, diet, and complementary medicine

• Herbal and dietary supplements – evidence is limited by
poor quality studies and small sample sizes. Consider the
uncertainty about long-term efficacy, safety, and interactions.
• Vitamin B1 may be more effective than placebo – limited
evidence.
• Magnesium, vitamin B6 may provide pain relief – some
evidence.
• Vitamin E may be effective in relieving dysmenorrhoea – some
evidence.
• Studies of fish oils and the Japanese herbal remedy
toki-shakuyaku-san – too small to draw meaningful conclusions.
• Chinese herbal medicine – some evidence; however, results are
limited by poor methodological quality of the included trials
(Cochrane review, 2008).

• Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation
(TENS) – involves use of electrodes to stimulate the skin
at various frequencies and intensities in an attempt to
diminish pain perception. High-frequency TENS provides
more effective pain relief when compared with placebo
and low-frequency TENS (Cochrane review, 2002). Side
effects – muscle tightness, headaches, nausea, redness or
burning of the skin in over 10% of cases.
• Acupuncture – Acupuncture may reduce period pain.
(Cochrane review, 2011) – limited evidence.
• Spinal manipulation – Cochrane review (2006) – no
evidence of benefit.

SECTION 2

Medical management

Non-hormonal

Disorders of menstruation

First-line options

Hormonal treatment

• NSAIDs – first-line treatment unless contraindicated, for the relief of pain and to improve
daily activity. (Cochrane review, 2010). Treatment is initiated with the onset of bleeding and/or
symptoms and need not be necessary for more than 2–3 days.
• Acetaminophen – first-line treatment if NSAIDs are contraindicated or not tolerated, or in
addition to an NSAID if the response is insufficient – limited evidence.
• Codeine may be added to acetaminophen or an NSAID if the response is insufficient.

Consider it as alternative first-line treatment.

Combined oral contraception

Progestin regimens

• Can be a first-line therapy for some women.
* A significant reduction in painful menstrual cramping with COC containing both low
and medium dose of ethinyl oestradiol compared with placebo (Cochrane review, 2009).
* Continuous COC may be used.

• Depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) can also induce endometrial atrophy, with a
resultant reduction in dysmenorrhoea.
• Progestin-only pill (POP) may decrease menstrual flow and menstrual cramping.
• Levonorgestrel IUS – although ovulation is not suppressed, it has a local effect on the
endometrium, which becomes atrophic, and dysmenorrhoea has been shown to improve.
• Observational studies – POP, LNG-IUS may be effective at relieving pain associated with
menstruation.

If no relief with medical treatment:

Surgical management

• Presacral neurectomy (PSN):
* There is limited evidence (Cochrane review, 2005) for use of PSN in the management of
primary dysmenorrhoea. Weigh the risks against the expected benefits.
* PSN involves total transaction of the presacral nerves lying within the boundaries of the
interiliac triangle.
* Complications include constipation as well as urinary urgency, which is unlikely to
respond to medical treatment. Seen in 5% of women treated with PSN.
* Laparoscopic uterosacral nerve ablation (LUNA) – no evidence of benefit.

Laparoscopy – endometriosis is present at laparoscopy
in 12–32% of women, but it may be found in up to 50%
of teenagers.

• Hysterectomy:
* When an underlying disease, amenable to hysterectomy, is demonstrated and the
patient has completed her family.
* Hysterectomy may offer permanent relief for the woman who has pain confined to
her menses.

SECTION 2

Disorders of menstruation

CHAPTER 8 Premenstrual syndrome

Background and definition

Prevalence

• A condition that manifests with distressing physical, behavioural, and psychological symptoms in the absence of
organic or underlying psychiatric disease, which regularly recurs during the luteal phase of each menstrual cycle
and disappears or significantly regresses by the end of menstruation.
• Mild – does not interfere with personal/social and professional life.
• Moderate – interferes with personal/social and professional life but still able to function and interact, although
maybe suboptimally.
• Severe – unable to interact personally/socially/professionally; withdraws from social and professional activities.
• Precise aetiology is unknown but cyclical ovarian activity and the effect of oestradiol and progesterone on the
neurotransmitters serotonin and γ aminobutyric acid (GABA) may be key factors.

• Refer to a psychiatrist – women with marked underlying psychopathology
as well as PMS.
• Refer to a gynaecologist – when simple measures fail and when the severity
of the PMS justifies gynaecological intervention.
• Manage in an MDT – gynaecologist, psychiatrist, dietician, and counsellor.
• SSRIs prescription only by psychiatrists and doctors with a special interest.

History
•
•
•
•

• Prevalence of severe PMS – 3–30%.
• More prevalent in women who are:
* obese.
* perform less exercise and are of lower academic achievement.
• Less prevalent in women using hormonal contraception.

Psychological – mood swings, irritability, depression, and feeling out of control.
Physical – breast tenderness, bloating, and headaches.
Behavioural – reduced visuospatial and cognitive ability and an increase in accidents.
Record symptoms prospectively, over two cycles, using a symptom diary.

Management

First-line options

Lifestyle measures
• Consider lifestyle adjustments such as improved selfcare, low glycaemic index diet, stress reduction and
exercise.
• Exercise – evidence from non-RCTs – some benefit.

Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)
Medical management
Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) – proven efficacy and safety (Cochrane review, 2009).
• Continuous or luteal phase (day 15–28) low-dose SSRIs.
• Abrupt withdrawal can result in withdrawal symptoms; withdraw gradually over a few weeks. Not necessary
with low-dose luteal-phase SSRIs.
• Luteal-phase regimens with the newer agents such as citalopram and either luteal-phase or symptom-onset
dosing with citalopram may produce resolution of symptoms where other SSRIs have failed.
• No data confirming the synergistic effects of SSRIs with ovulation suppression methods.
Combined new-generation pill – Yasmin, Cilest.
• Drospirenone plus ethenyl oestradiol 20 µg may help treat PMS (Cochrane review, 2009).
• Lower-dose Yasmin (Yaz – 20µg EE and 3 mg drospirenone) is effective; however, it is not yet available in the UK.
• Use the contraceptive pill continuously rather than cyclically.

• Consider routinely as a treatment option.
• Systematic review – low quality evidence from RCTs; CBT may have
important beneficial effects in managing symptoms associated with PMS.

http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/CBO9781316156513.009

Second-line options

Higher-dose SSRIs continuously or luteal phase SSRIs

Oestradiol patches + oral progestogen or Mirena

•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Use of continuous oestradiol needs cyclical progestogen (10–12 days) to avoid endometrial hyperplasia.
Oestradiol patches (100 µg) + oral progestogen such as duphaston, 10 mg D17–D28.
Oral progesterone or an LNG-IUS or vaginal progesterone for progestogen-intolerant woman.
Use lowest possible dose of progestogen to minimize adverse effects.
Low systemic levels of levonorgestrel released by LNG-IUS can initially produce PMS-type symptoms.
Use alternative methods of contraception when oestradiol preparations are used to suppress ovulation.
There are insufficient data on the long-term effects on breast and endometrial tissue.

Third-line options

Gonadotrophin-releasing analogues

Progestogens

•
•
•
•

Progestogens and progesterone:

Profound cycle suppression and elimination of PMS.
Lack of efficacy means a questionable diagnosis.
Continue treatment for 6 months when used alone.
Longer use in combination with HRT– only in women with severe PMS due to its hypo-oestrogenic effects and
trabecular bone density loss.
• Add-back hormone therapy – continuous combined HRT or tibolone, as it reduces menopausal symptoms
without reappearance of PMS-like progestogenic effects.
• Women on long-term treatment – annual measurement of bone mineral density, as bone loss may still occur in
some individuals. Stop treatment if bone density declines significantly in scans performed one year apart.

• Meta-analysis – no benefit of treatment.
• Insufficient evidence to recommend their routine use.

Complementary therapies – may be of benefit.
An integrated approach is beneficial. This may include complementary
medicines, which themselves may not be evidence based.
• Clinical studies are limited and underpowered.
• Referring clinician retains legal responsibility for the patient.
• Consider interactions with conventional medicines.

Fourth-line option

Surgical management – TAH + BSO + HRT (including testosterone)
• May provide some benefit.
• Give a trial of preoperative use of GnRH analogues as a test of cure and to ensure that HRT is tolerated,
particularly in women of a younger age group (< 45 years).
• Indicated for extremely severe PMS when other treatment has failed.
• Prescribe HRT in women undergoing surgical oophorectomy before the age of 50 years. Without adequate
HRT, PMS symptoms are replaced by those of the menopause.
• Replace testosterone, as the ovaries are a major production source (50%) and deficiency could result in
distressing low libido.

SECTION 2

Disorders of menstruation

Know your drug

What not to do

SSRIs

Yasmin – ethinyl oestradiol and drospirenone

• Mechanism – SSRIs increase the extracellular level of the
neurotransmitter serotonin by inhibiting its reuptake into the
presynaptic cell, increasing the level of serotonin in the synaptic
cleft available to bind to the postsynaptic receptor; helps lift
mood.
• Dose – smallest dose possible, generally TDS.
• Indications:
* depression, anxiety disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder
(OCD), panic disorder, serious phobias.
* PMS.
• Side effects – nausea, insomnia, and reduction in libido and
other sexual dysfunction. Withdrawal symptoms on abrupt
withdrawal – GIT disturbances, headache, anxiety, dizziness,
paraesthesia, sleep disturbances, fatigue, influenza-like
symptoms, and sweating.

• Mechanism – it has potent anti-mineralocorticoid
properties, counteracts the oestrogen, and has mild antiandrogen activity.
• Indications:
* Contraception.
* PMS.
* Hirsuitism.
* Acne.
• Side effects – breast pain or tenderness, depressed mood,
headaches, irregular bleeding, migraine, nausea, risk of
thromboembolism, hyperkalaemia.

•
•
•
•

Combine SSRIs with ovulation suppression methods.
Progestogens and progesterone – routine use.
Use of continuous oestradiol.
GnRHa for more than 6 months.

CHAPTER 9 Heavy menstrual bleeding

Background and definition

Prevalence and incidence

•

Excessive menstrual blood loss that interferes with the woman’s physical, emotional, social, and material QOL.

•

About one third of women describe their periods as heavy.

•

An objectively measured blood loss of 60–80 ml or more per menstruation (average blood loss is 30–40 ml, and 90% of

hospital referral and account for 12% of all gynaecological referrals.

Causes
History
•

•

Unexplained (dysfunctional uterine bleeding) – 40–60%.

•

Uterine and ovarian pathologies:

Nature of the bleeding – age at menarche and details of menstrual cycle; length of cycle, the number of days of menstruation,
length of heavy periods, previous periods.

•

•

Symptoms that might suggest potential underlying causes – persistent IMB or PCB.

•

Dyspareunia, dysmenorrhoea, pelvic pain and/or pressure symptoms, vaginal discharge.

•

Impact on QOL and woman’s ideas, concerns, expectations, and needs.

•

Factors that may determine treatment options (such as presence of co-morbidity).

•

Symptoms suggesting an underlying systemic disease, such as hypothyroidism or coagulation disorder (e.g., von Willebrand

•

*

Uterine fibroids. * Adenomyosis.

*

Endometrial polyps. * Endometrial hyperplasia or carcinoma.

* PCOS.

Systemic diseases and disorders:
*

Coagulation disorders (e.g., von Willebrand disease).

*

Hypothyroidism. * Liver or renal disease.

Iatrogenic causes: * Anticoagulant treatment. * Chemotherapy.
*

IUCD (blood loss may be increased by 40–50% over 6–12 months).

disease).
•

Smear status, contraceptive history, fertility history, and future plans for a family.

•

Family history of endometriosis and coagulation disorders.

•

Diagnose menorrhagia – when both the woman and clinician agree menstrual bleeding is heavy after a history.

Examine and/or investigate if history suggests structural or histological abnormality.

Risks or complications

•

•

Affects QOL by limiting normal activities, social life, and work.

•

Woman’s sex life may be negatively affected.

•

Mood changes.

•

Iron deficiency anaemia in about two thirds of women.

If history suggests no structural or histological abnormality, the cause of menorrhagia is likely to be idiopathic
with no obvious underlying pathology. In most cases, this will respond to symptomatic treatment.

•

One can start medical treatment without carrying out an examination or other investigations at initial
consultation in primary care, unless the treatment chosen is LNG-IUS.

Examination
•

Required in women in whom:
*

Symptoms are suggestive of underlying abnormalities.

*

LNG-IUS is being considered.

*

Initial treatment has been ineffective.

•

Vulval examination – evidence of external bleeding and signs of infection.

•

Speculum examination.

•

Vaginal examination – uterine or adnexal enlargement or tenderness.

•

Systemic signs of underlying disease – hirsutism, thyroid enlargement or nodularity, or changes in
skin pigmentation, bruises, or petechiae (coagulation disorders).

35

Service provision
Refer to secondary care:
•

HMB despite adequate trials of medical treatment.

•

Women with fibroids that are palpable abdominally, or who have intra-cavity fibroids, and/or whose uterine length
as measured at USS or hysteroscopy is > 12 cm.

•

Urgently, if a suspicious mass is detected. Symptoms suggesting a possible malignancy – persistent IMB or PCB,
vulval mass, or bleeding due to ulceration, features of cervical cancer.

•

Woman who wishes to consider surgery.

•

Woman who has iron deficiency anaemia that has failed to respond to treatment.

Advice and counselling
Investigations
•

Full blood count to rule out iron deficiency anaemia.

•

Test for coagulation disorders in women who have had HMB since menarche and have personal or family

•

Thyroid function test when other signs and symptoms of thyroid disease are present.

•

Biopsy to exclude endometrial cancer or atypical hyperplasia if:
*

•

Discuss the natural variability and range of menstrual blood loss.

If reassurance alone is not appropriate, discuss the different treatment option, effectiveness and
acceptability of treatments, including adverse effects.

history suggesting a coagulation disorder.

•

Discuss the impact on fertility of any planned surgery or uterine artery embolization (UAE) may have, and
if a potential treatment (hysterectomy or ablation) involves the loss of fertility.

•

Women aged 45 years and over. * Persistent IMB. * Treatment failure or ineffective ­treatment.

•

USS is the first-line diagnostic tool for identifying structural abnormalities.

•

Perform hysteroscopy only when USS results are inconclusive; e.g., to determine the exact location of a fibroid

Refer for examination, investigations, and to consider surgical options.

•

Oral norethisterone (NET, 15 mg) daily from D5–26 of the menstrual cycle. Not an effective form of
contraception. However, a dose that is effective in decreasing menstrual blood loss is also likely to inhibit
ovulation, and so its use is not appropriate in women wishing to conceive.

•

Surgical management

Depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) is the recommended long-acting progestogen. Bleeding is likely to
stop completely.

•

Do not use oral progestogens given during the luteal phase only for the treatment of HMB.

Fibroids > 3 cm in size

Normal uterus +/- small fibroid uterus < 3 cm in size

Endometrial ablation

Uterine artery embolization

•

Removes or destroys the womb lining and stops heavy bleeding. Results in clinically relevant reduction in bleeding and improvement in QOL.

•

Slightly less effective than hysterectomy. • In some women, the lining grows back and the surgery may need to be repeated.

•

Indications:

•

*

HMB with severe impact on a woman’s QOL.

*

Medical treatment has been ineffective, or was not suitable.

*

Normal uterus and those with small uterine fibroids (< 3 cm in diameter).

*

Uterus no bigger than a 10-week pregnancy.

Selection criteria: * Family is complete.

* Willing to continue contraception if not sterilized. * Normal-sized uterine cavity (for most procedures).

­M yomectomy

* Willing to

undergo hysterectomy, if required.
•

Contraindications:
Absolute:
*

* The woman wishes to retain her fertility.

* Genital tract malignancy. * Unexplained vaginal bleeding.

SECTION 2

Disorders of menstruation

CHAPTER 10 Fibroids (leiomyoma)

Prevalence and incidence

Background and definition

• Prevalence increases progressively from puberty until the menopause – 40–60% of
women have fibroids by 35 years of age, which is increased to 70–80% by 49 years
of age.
• Usually shrink after menopause as they are promoted and maintained by oestrogen
and progestogen.
• Prevalence is higher in:
* Black women – tend to occur at an earlier age, are larger, and more likely to be
symptomatic.
* Women with early onset of puberty.
* Obese women – probably due to higher oestrogen levels.
• Risk is reduced by pregnancy and decreases with increasing number of pregnancies.

• Benign tumours arising from the myometrium of the uterus.
• Subserosal (SS) fibroids develop near the outer serosal surface of the uterus and extend into
the peritoneal cavity. Asymptomatic; may cause pressure symptoms.
• Intramural (IM) fibroids develop within the myometrium. May cause HMB, dysmenorrhoea.
• Submucosal (SM) fibroids develop near the endometrial surface of the uterus and extend
into the uterine cavity. May cause HMB, pain, and subfertility.
• Pedunculated – attached to the myometrium by a pedicle. May cause torsion.

History
•
•
•
•
•

Symptoms depend on the size, number, and location of the fibroids.
Most common – heavy and prolonged bleeding.
Abdominal swelling, pelvic or abdominal pain or discomfort.
Dyspareunia.
Pressure symptoms – constipation or urinary symptoms such as
frequency or difficulty in voiding.
• Acute, severe abdominal or pelvic pain following torsion of a
pedunculated fibroid or ‘red degeneration’.
• Subfertility, miscarriage.

Examination
• Abdominal examination – mass arising from the
pelvis, smooth/multi-nodular, firm, mobile from sideto-side.
• Pelvic examination – mass arising out of the pelvis,
with an irregular knobbly shape, a firm or hard
consistency, and can be moved slightly from side-toside. Any movement of the abdominal mass moves
the cervix.

Risks or issues

• Gynaecological:
* HBM – anaemia, affects QOL.
* Compression of ureters by large
fibroids – hydronephrosis.
* Torsion of pedunculated fibroid
– acute pain.
* Leiomyosarcoma – minimal risk.

a
a

• Fertility issues.
• Pregnancy complications:
* First- and second-trimester miscarriage.
* Higher rates of Caesarean delivery.
* Preterm delivery.
* Malpresentation, mechanical complications in labour.
* PPH.
* Acute pain requiring hospital admission (5–6%) – red degeneration of
fibroid owing to avascular necrosis (when rapid growth of a fibroid,
promoted by high levels of sex hormones, outgrows its blood supply).

Differential diagnosis
• Adenomyosis may be difficult to distinguish from
multiple small fibroids and may coexist with them.
• Pregnancy.
• Benign causes of a pelvic mass: benign ovarian mass –
hemorrhagic cyst, dermoid cyst, or endometrioma.
• Malignant causes of a pelvic mass: ovarian cancer,
endometrial cancer, leiomyosarcoma.

http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/CBO9781316156513.011

Investigations
• USS, depending on the uterine size, a transabdominal or TVS (or both) to assess the location,
number, and size of the fibroids.
• Saline or contrast sonography – use of saline as a contrast medium improves the accuracy of
assessment of SM fibroids.
• 3D USS can locate fibroids accurately.
• MRI – provides information on exact location and size of fibroids for the interventional
radiologist and is superior to conventional ultrasound.

Management
Symptomatic fibroids

Medical management

Asymptomatic fibroids
• Refer for secondary care if:
* Fibroids are palpable abdominally. * Intra-cavity fibroids.
* Uterine length on USS >12 cm.
• No need to monitor the size of asymptomatic fibroids.
• Do not advise hysterectomy for asymptomatic fibroids solely to improve
detection of adnexal masses, to prevent impairment of renal function, or to rule
out malignancy.

Surgical management

Tends to give only short-term relief.

NSAIDS

Contraceptive steroids

LNG-IUS

• Effective in reducing dysmenorrhoea, but there
are no studies that document improvement in
women with dysmenorrhoea caused by fibroids.

•
•
•
•

• Small studies suggest that it may be effective
for treatment of HMB.
• However, these women may have a higher
rate of expulsion and vaginal spotting.

Data is limited.
COCs may control bleeding without stimulating further growth.
Studies of progestin therapy – mixed results.
While on COCs, monitor the fibroids and uterine size.

Anti-progesterone agents

Aromatase inhibitors

GnRHa

• Mifepristone acts at the level of the progesterone receptors,
found in high concentration in fibroids.
• Reduction in fibroid volume of 26–74% (comparable to
GnRHa, slower rate of recurrent growth after cessation of
mifepristone treatment), amenorrhoea rates up to 90%, and
stable bone mineral density.
• Side effects – endometrial hyperplasia without atypia
(14–28%) and transient elevations in transaminase levels (4%)
requiring LFT monitoring.
• May have a short-term role in the preoperative management of
leiomyomas, but further research is necessary.

• Aromatase inhibitors block ovarian and
peripheral oestrogen production and decrease
oestradiol levels.
• Fewer side effects than GnRHa, with the
benefit of a rapid effect.
• Small studies showed reduction in leiomyoma
size and symptoms.
• Further research is necessary.

• A 35–65% reduction in fibroid volume within 3 months.
• Preoperative in women with anaemia and to reduce the size of
fibroids and blood loss during surgery.
• Systematic review – no significant difference in blood loss with
preoperative GnRHa has been demonstrated.
• Add-back therapy. (See Chapter 12: Enclometriosis.)
• A sequential regimen, in which a GnRHa is first used to achieve
downregulation to which steroids are added after 1–3 months of
therapy, gives maximal results. However, the addition of progestin
add-back therapy results in an increase in mean uterine volume to
95% of baseline within 24 months.

SECTION 2

Disorders of menstruation

Surgical management

Hysterectomy

• Relieves symptoms, prevents
recurrence, provides
permanent contraception,
and allows treatment with
oestrogen-only HRT.
• See Chapter 9: Heavy
menstrual bleeding.

Minimally invasive

Myomectomy

See next page.

Laparoscopic myomectomy (LM)

Abdominal myomectomy (AM)

• AM is a safe and effective option; significantly improves
menorrhagia and pelvic pressure symptoms. (ACOG)
• Risks – hysterectomy; blood loss, risk of transfusion;
adhesions.
• Recurrence – depends on the number of fibroids; single
leiomyoma – 27% risk and multiple leiomyomas – 59% risk.
• Risk of recurrence – conflicting reports on whether the
preoperative use of GnRH agonists affects recurrence risk.

• Compared with AM – LM is associated with less haemoglobin drop, reduced
operative blood loss, quicker recovery, diminished postoperative pain, and fewer
overall complications but longer operation time. Major complications, pregnancy, and
recurrence are comparable.
• Patient selection – be cautious if fibroids > 5–8 cm, multiple fibroids, or presence of deep
IM leiomyomas, as it may be associated with increased operative time and blood loss.
• Recurrence rate of 12% at 1 year and up to 84% at 8 years.
• Conversion rate to AM – 11% and complication rates 8–11%.

Hysteroscopic myomectomy

• For abnormal uterine bleeding caused by SM fibroids.
• Classified based on the amount of leiomyoma within the uterine cavity:
* Type 0 – completely intra-cavitary. * Type I – < 50% intramural. * Type II – > 50% intramural.
• Successful removal at the initial hysteroscopy – 85–95%. Subsequent surgery is needed in ≈ 5–15% of cases, and most of these cases involve a
second hysteroscopic procedure.
• Effectiveness of the procedure decreases over time with a success rate of 95% at 1 year to 76% at 5 years.
• Complication rate of 1–5% – fluid overload with secondary hyponatraemia, pulmonary oedema, cerebral oedema, intraoperative and
postoperative bleeding, uterine perforation, gas embolism, and infection.

Preoperative and intraoperative adjuvants

Preoperative
Gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists:

• Correction of preoperative anaemia.
• A significant reduction in uterine volume could change the surgical approach, such as allowing a transverse incision, an
endoscopic procedure, or a vaginal hysterectomy.
• Improve haematological parameters, decrease blood loss, operating time, and postoperative pain when given for 2–3
months preoperatively. However, no significant decrease in transfusion risk or improvement in QOL.
• Disadvantage – it may make the fibroids softer and the surgical planes less distinct, leading to difficulty in dissection.
• Evidence of increased risk of fibroid recurrence after GnRH agonists pre-treatment is equivocal.
• Weigh the benefits of preoperative GnRH agonists against their cost and side effects.
Gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonists:

Advantage of not inducing an initial steroidal flare as seen with GnRH agonists. Rapid effect of the GnRH antagonist
allows a shorter duration of side effects with pre-surgical treatment.
• Reduce fibroid volume by 25–40% in 19 days, thereby allowing surgery to be scheduled sooner.

Intraoperative

• Systematic review on interventions to reduce blood
loss during myomectomy – evidence from a few RCTs
is limited: misoprostol, vasopressin, bupivacaine plus
epinephrine, tranexamic acid, tourniquet, and mesna may
reduce bleeding during myomectomy.

http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/CBO9781316156513.011

Minimally invasive procedures/myolysis
A number of energy sources and techniques have been used to induce necrosis in fibroids, including
diathermy, laser ablation, and radiofrequency ablation. Good quality evidence is lacking on the
effectiveness and safety of these techniques.

UAE

Laparoscopic

MRI-guided focused ultrasound energy

Laser photocoagulation

• Laparoscopic Nd-YAG laser – coagulates the
myoma, causes devascularization and significant
shrinkage of fibroids.
• Do not offer to women who desire pregnancies
because of risk of uterine rupture.
• Risk of dense adhesions in 10–50% of cases
and there is concern that adhesion formation
between the uterus and bowel may result in
bowel obstruction.

• High-intensity ultrasound waves are directed into a focal
volume of a leiomyoma – produces well-defined regions
of protein denaturation, irreversible cell damage, and
coagulative necrosis. Although there is only modest uterine
volume reduction (14% at 6 months and 9% at 12 months),
71% of patients reported symptom reduction at 6 months
and 51% at 12 months.
• Adverse effects – heavy menses requiring transfusion,
persistent pain and bleeding, nausea, leg and buttock pain
caused by sonification of the sciatic nerve (self-limiting).

MRI-guided percutaneous laser ablation – under local
anaesthetic, 41% reduction in mean fibroid volume.
QOL and satisfaction scores were similar to those seen
in women after hysterectomy.
Interstitial laser photocoagulation – the laser fibres are
placed in the fibroids under laparoscopic guidance.
Can be performed by any gynaecologist trained in
laparoscopic surgery without the need for expensive
equipment to monitor thermal changes. This gives it
the potential for wider use in clinical practice.

Uterine artery embolization
Consider UAE for women with symptomatic fibroids as a treatment option. (NICE)
• Femoral artery is cannulated and an embolic agent is injected into the uterine arteries
to impair the blood supply to the uterus and fibroids. This has a differential effect on
fibroids (that have a higher blood supply than the surrounding myometrium).
• Fibroid shrinkage – 60% by the end of 6 months with further shrinkage up to one year.
• Indications:
* Women with medical conditions that contraindicate surgery.
* Women who are unwilling to have a blood transfusion.
* Women who had previous unsuccessful surgery for fibroids.

Contraindications

• Absolute:
* Current or recent infection of genital tract.
* Patient refusing hysterectomy under any circumstances.
* Doubtful diagnosis due to the clinical factors or inadequate imaging.
• Relative:
* Narrow-stalked, pedunculated SS fibroids – might detach and cause
significant complications.
* Large fibroids – the outcome for smaller fibroids is better than for
larger fibroids with similar complication rates. Large fibroid is not a
contraindication. However, volume reduction might not be sufficient
to satisfy patient’s expectations.

47

• Do not give GnRHa within 2 months prior to the procedure.
• MDT – gynaecologist and interventional radiologist.
• MRI – superior to USS for diagnosing fibroids and adenomyosis. UAE in the presence of
adenomyosis is less effective.
• Remove any IUD, if used, prior to the procedure.
Complications

• Immediate:
* Groin haematoma, arterial thrombosis, dissection, and pseudo-aneurysm.
* Non-target embolization – presence of ovarian–uterine anastomoses can compromise the ovary.
• Early – post-embolization syndrome – pain, nausea, fever, flu-like symptoms with raised
inflammatory markers and white cell count. Frequent and self-limiting. Manage with analgesics
and anti-inflammatory drugs. Re-admission may be required in 3–5% of cases.
• Late:
* Vaginal discharge (self-limiting) – 20–30%.
* Persistent discharge with pain may be due to expulsion of fibroid.
* Fibroid expulsion – 10%, more common with SM fibroids, may require hysteroscopic removal
in 6% of cases.
* Sexual dysfunction – 12% risk of changes in sexual function.
* Infection (endometritis) – 0.5%. Rarely septicaemia and multi-organ failure. Emergency
hysterectomy may be needed as life-saving surgery in 2–3%.
* Need for further treatment (repeat UAE, exploration of uterine cavity, myomectomy,
hysterectomy) in future – 25% if < 40 years; 10% if 40–50 years of age.
* Amenorrhoea (POI) – 1.5–7%, but the majority of these patients are > 45 years old (25% risk
in this age group).

SECTION 2

Disorders of menstruation

Other issues with fibroids

Risk of leiomyosarcoma

HRT

Contraception

• Symptoms may persist into menopause with HRT.
• HRT may modestly increase fibroid size.
• Women with fibroids who take HRT are more
likely to have abnormal bleeding.
• Fibroid usually shrinks quickly after stopping HRT.

• Women with no distortion of the uterine cavity all
methods of contraception can be used.
• Women with distortion of the uterine cavity – do not
use IUD and IUS if they cannot be fitted easily.
• It is not clear from the available evidence, what effect
hormonal methods of contraception have on the size of
pre-existing fibroids.

Labour and risk of uterine rupture following myomectomy (ACOG)

• There are no clinical trials that specifically address this issue.
• A trial of labour is contraindicated in patients at high risk of uterine rupture (previous
classical or T-shaped uterine incisions). Because myomectomy can also produce a
transmural incision in the uterus, it often has been treated in a similar way.
• A study reported no uterine rupture in 212 deliveries (83% vaginal) after myomectomy.
• Pooled data of LM (750 pregnancies) – one case of uterine rupture.
• Most obstetricians allow women who underwent hysteroscopic myomectomy for type 0
or type I leiomyomas to go for vaginal delivery; however, there are case reports of uterine
rupture in women who had uterine perforation during hysteroscopy.
• Risk of uterine rupture in pregnancy after LM or hysteroscopic myomectomy is low.
However, because of the serious nature of this complication, a high index of suspicion
must be maintained when managing pregnancies after this procedure.

•
•
•
•

Assess leiomyoma location, size, and number.
Try naturally for 2 years, unless the woman is ≥ 34 years of age.
SM fibroids – advise hysteroscopic resection.
Myomectomy – owing to the potential adverse effects of even non-distorting
leiomyomas on IVF outcomes, consider myomectomy for a woman with uterine fibroids
who has undergone unsuccessful IVF cycles despite appropriate ovarian response and
good quality embryos. (ACOG)
• UAE – reduces fibroid volume, therefore possible to increase pregnancy chance.
However, the effect of UAE on the pregnancy outcome or IVF has not been determined.

• Traditionally, the major clinical sign to suspect leiomyosarcoma
is rapid growth in uterine size. However, incidence of sarcomas
is rare (2–3/1000) and they are no more common in women who
have experienced rapidly enlarging uterine size.
• Other risk factors for sarcomas – increasing age, a history of prior
pelvic radiation, tamoxifen use, or a rare genetic predisposition.
• Endometrial biopsy and MRI may be useful in diagnosing
sarcomas and differentiating them from other intrauterine lesions.

Fertility

• The contribution of fibroids to infertility is difficult to assess because of its high
prevalence in the general population. Subfertility is not absolute with fibroids and many
patients conceive without intervention.
• Mechanism – mechanical effect due to cavity distortion with IM and SM fibroids,
possible effect on uterine blood flow, and impaired implantation with IM fibroids.
• Fibroids are present in ≈ 5–10% of women with infertility and are the sole factor
identified in 1–2.4% of women with infertility.
• Effect of fibroids on reproductive outcomes after IVF – Systematic review:
* SM/IM fibroids distorting the uterine cavity cause a 70% reduction in pregnancy
rates compared with women who do not have fibroids. Removal of these fibroids
restores the pregnancy rate to that of the control group.
* Following IVF treatment there is a significant decrease in pregnancy in women with
non-cavity-distorting IM fibroids compared with those without fibroids.

Management
• Symptomatic women – given the risk of recurrence, intervene as close to the desired
pregnancy as practical.
• Consider prior treatment history, possible benefit of normalization of the endometrial
cavity, the particular fertility consequences of each technique, and the risk of pregnancy
complications with untreated fibroids.
• Rule out other causes of subfertility.

Evidence round-up – UAE
• Early and mid-term results – it is at least as safe as the surgical alternatives.
• It provides good symptom relief and is particularly affective for HMB.
• The long-term safety and effectiveness of this technique have not been fully evaluated.

Hysterectomy vs UAE

Myomectomy vs UAE

• Equal results for QOL with similar complication rates.
• Hospital stay and recovery are significantly shorter with UAE.
• Around 80–90% have significantly improved symptoms at one year with 40–70% reduction in
fibroid volume.
• Up to 10% of women require further treatment (repeat UAE or hysterectomy) within 1 year and
20–25% within 5 years.
• UAE is significantly more cost-effective at the end of one year; however, it may reduce longer
term as some patients will require further treatment.
• The faster, shorter recovery period of UAE with uterine conservation needs to be weighed
against the need for further treatment in a minority of women.

• Evidence is much less clear.
• Hospital stay and recovery time are significantly shorter with UAE, but it has a high
re-intervention rate. Symptom control and complication rates are similar.
• Trend towards higher FSH levels in UAE.
• More pregnancies and significantly fewer miscarriages in myomectomy.
• Obstetric and perinatal outcomes are similar.
• More evidence is needed to establish the role of UAE in patients wishing to maintain
fertility.
• Reserve UAE only for patients maintaining fertility, where the option of myomectomy is
fully discussed but is felt to be less suitable.

Pregnancy outcome following UAE

• Case series have documented successful pregnancies.
• There is an increased risk of miscarriage (36% vs 10–15%), preterm delivery (16% vs 5–10%), Caesarean
section (67% vs 22%), malpresentation (10% vs 5%), and PPH (14% vs 4–6%) compared with the general
population. No difference in fetal growth restriction (7% vs 10%) was seen.
• Be cautious when considering UAE for treating symptomatic fibroids in women desiring a future pregnancy.

SECTION 2

Disorders of menstruation

CHAPTER 11 Adenomyosis

Background and definition

Prevalence and incidence

• Benign invasion of endometrium into the myometrium, resulting in ectopic, non-neoplastic,
endometrial glands and stroma surrounded by the hypertrophic and hyperplastic myometrium.
• Histological diagnosis – widely accepted definition is glandular extension below the
endometrial–myometrial interface (EMI) of > 2.5 mm (one low-power field). Adenomyosis subbasalis – minimally invasive adenomyosis extending < 2 mm beneath the basal endometrium.
• In diffuse adenomyosis uteri, the uterus becomes enlarged and globular. Focal lesions can
resemble leiomyoma. Adenomyosis has poorly defined margins and cannot be enucleated. The
posterior wall is more often affected than the anterior wall.

• Adenomyosis has been reported to occur in about 30% of the general female population
and in up to 5–70% of hysterectomy specimens, depending on the definition.
• Risk factors – multiparity, miscarriage, TOP, endometriosis, HMB, infertility, curettage in
pregnancy, endometrial hyperplasia.
• No difference – age at menarche, menopausal status, age at first childbirth, COCs, IUCD,
tubal sterilization, endometrial carcinoma, caesarean section.

Clinical features
•
•
•
•
•
•

Asymptomatic in 35%.
Abnormal uterine bleeding (50%), HMB.
Secondary dysmenorrhoea (30%).
Dyspareunia and chronic pelvic pain – less common.
Frequency and severity of symptoms correlate with the extent and depth of adenomyosis.
On examination – diffusely enlarged, tender uterus.

Investigations
• USS – the normal myometrium has three distinct sonographic layers. The middle layer is
the most echogenic and is separated from the thin outer layer by the arcuate venous and
arterial plexuses. The inner layer is hypo-echoic relative to the middle and outer layers
(the subendometrial halo). Adenomyosis can distort the appearance of these zones.
• TVS criteria:
* Globular uterine enlargement in the absence of fibroids.
* Asymmetrical enlargement of the anterior or posterior myometrial wall.
* Heterogeneous echo texture – lack of homogeneity within the myometrium with
architectural disturbance. This finding is the most predictive of adenomyosis.
* Subendometrial echogenic linear striations – invasion of the endometrial glands into
the subendometrial tissue induces a hyperplastic reaction, which appears as echogenic
linear striations fanning out from the endometrial layer.
* Obscure endometrial/myometrial border – invasion of the myometrium by the glands
obscures the normally distinct endometrial/myometrial border.
* Cystic anechoic spaces or lakes in the myometrium of variable size.
* Thickening of the transition zone (subendometrial hypoechoic halo) of 12 mm or
greater has been shown to be associated with adenomyosis.

• HSG – low sensitivity and specificity. Features include multiple, small (< 4 mm) spicules extending
from the endometrium into the myometrium, with saccular endings. A local accumulation of contrast
material in the myometrium may produce a honeycomb appearance.
• MRI – 3 different zones can be identified within the uterus. The appearance of diffuse or focal
widening of the junctional zone is suggestive of adenomyosis.
* Sensitivity and specificity are comparable to or better than those of TVS. A systematic review
reported MRI to be better than TVS – TVS has a sensitivity of 72%, specificity of 81%, whereas
MRI has a sensitivity of 77%, specificity of 89%.
* Cost and limited availability hinders its routine use.
* MRI is superior to TVS where associated fibroids or additional pathologies are suspected.
• CT – poor diagnostic value owing to similar images portrayed by foci and normal myometrium.
• Hysteroscopic or laparoscopic myometrial biopsy – its role remains limited. Myometrial biopsy of
the posterior uterine wall is superior to TVS, but its routine use is not recommended.
• TVS remains the first investigation of choice due to its efficacy, safety, and lower cost.

Management

Medical management

Non-hormonal

• Mefenamic and tranexamic acid may be
effective for the symptomatic relief of
menorrhagia, but there are no studies
specific to adenomyosis.

51

IUD and LNG-IUS

Hormonal

• Progestogens, the COCs, and GnRHa – the effect of these
treatments is limited to a variable and unpredictable degree
of symptomatic relief, usually restricted to the duration of
treatment.
• Low-dose, continuous COCs with withdrawal bleeds every
4–6 months may be effective in relieving menorrhagia and
dysmenorrhoea, but there are no specific studies on adenomyosis.
• GnRHa – reduce uterine volume and result in symptomatic relief
but their use is limited because of side effects.
• Danazol – limited due to serious side effects.
• Long-term, low-dose mifepristone causes anovulation, a
reduction in painful symptoms, and improves endometriosis
scores.
• Progestogenic agents – adenomyotic foci have been shown to
contain progesterone and oestrogen receptors and may undergo
decidualization when exposed to progesterone; symptoms may
then become more apparent. Progestogenic agents alone or in
combination with oestrogen, therefore, may not be effective.
• Aromatase inhibitor as effective as GnRHa in reducing
adenomyoma volume, without initial flare up or hot flashes. This
may be beneficial for short-term treatment of infertile females
who wish to avoid amenorrhea or surgery (RCT).

• Danazol-loaded IUD – a significant decrease in
dysmenorrhoea and reduction in bleeding have been
reported. Serum level of danazol with local IUD application
was undetectable and no systemic side effects were reported.
Three pregnancies were reported following discontinuation
of the treatment.
• LNG-IUS – menorrhagia has been shown to be reduced
leading to improvement of anaemia. Studies have reported
an improvement in dysmenorrhea and better health-related
QOL.

SECTION 2

Disorders of menstruation

Surgical management

• Adenomyomectomy – localized excision of affected myometrium (cytoreductive surgery) can
be performed in localized adenomyosis if the extent of the disease can be accurately defined.
The approach is similar to myomectomy and may be useful for women seeking to preserve
their fertility.
• There are reports of laparoscopic excision of focal adenomyosis. However, the accurate
preoperative localization and meticulous removal of all the lesions are factors associated with
the success of the procedure.
• Laparoscopic approach is associated with the concerns of haemostasis and inaccurate
assessment of the extent of diffuse disease without palpating the uterus. Open surgery remains
the mainstay for extensive disease.
• Excising diffuse disease may result in inadvertent removal of excess myometrial tissue, because
of unclear demarcation from surrounding normal myometrium.
• Complete microsurgical resection of the adenomyotic areas, followed by GnRHa, is reported
to improve symptoms and fertility. Published series are small, with limited success.
• Consider surgical and obstetric complications of myometrial excision. Excision of a large part
of the myometrium may lead to difficulty in wound apposition, decreased expansive capacity
of the uterus, and weakening, leading to uterine rupture.

• UAE has been shown to reduce the symptoms associated
with adenomyosis. The chances of a subsequent successful
pregnancy are unclear. A systematic review (15 studies)
reported short-term improvement in 83% and long-term
satisfaction of 65% with minimal complications.
• Transcatheter local infusion of MTX combined with UAE
under guidance of digital subtraction angiography – a study
reported a decrease in menstrual volume, dysmenorrhoea,
reduction of uterine size, with no chemotherapeutic side effects.
The efficacy was more evident in diffuse adenomyosis.

• Laparoscopic myometrial electrocoagulation – involves insertion of a monopolar or bipolar
needle electrode into the affected myometrium at approximately 1–2 cm intervals, which
induces localized coagulation and necrosis.
• Electrocoagulation can be difficult to apply with precision, destruction of all the abnormal
tissue may be incomplete and cannot be checked at the time of surgery, and it can reduce the
strength of the remaining myometrial tissue.
• There is a risk of emergency hysterectomy for uncontrollable bleeding and a high incidence of
adhesion formation.
• Uterine rupture has been reported as early as 12 weeks of gestation, hence it is an undesirable
option for women wishing to conceive. This technique may be best suitable for women > 40
years of age who have completed their families but who wish to avoid hysterectomy.

• Laparoscopic uterine artery ligation has been
studied in 20 women with symptomatic uterine
adenomyosis. Only 15% of women, however,
rated the treatment as satisfactory at 6-month
follow-up, suggesting that this approach may not
be effective.
• MRI-guided focused ultrasound ablation – a case
series reported that it is a well-tolerated and
effective alternative for selected patients.

• Hysterectomy remains the main surgical option for women
not wishing to preserve their fertility.

• Hysteroscopic ablation and excision – the success of
the resection depends on the depth of foci. In superficial
adenomyosis with penetration < 2 mm, the procedure is more
successful. With deep adenomyosis with penetration > 2 mm,
it is associated with poor results. It is generally undertaken
if the adenomyosis is confined to the superficial 3 mm of the
myometrium.
Ablation or resection of deeper myometrial tissue is associated
with risk of bleeding as arteries are situated approximately
5 mm deep to the myometrial surface. Unresected deeper
endometrial glands can persist and proliferate to cause
recurrence.
• Endomyometrial ablation is effective for lesions deeper than
the endometrial–myometrial junction whereas the efficacy of
hysteroscopic ablation is limited to foci 2–3 mm deep.

http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/CBO9781316156513.012

Adenomyosis and infertility

• Adenomyosis is usually diagnosed in the 4th and 5th decades of life in multiparous women
and is believed to increase with age. As more women are delaying their pregnancy until
later in their 30s or 40s, adenomyosis is encountered more frequently in fertility clinic.
• It is also possible that since its diagnosis by TVS and MRI became possible, it is being
encountered more frequently during the diagnostic work-up for infertility.
• There is evidence of a strong association between endometriosis and adenomyosis
(25– 70%) and that adenomyosis may play a role in infertility in women with
endometriosis.
• Possible link between adenomyosis and infertility is also becoming more plausible.

• Possible mechanism of subfertility in women with adenomyosis – gene dysregulation,
impaired uterine peristaltic activity, altered endometrial function and receptivity, impaired
implantation, altered decidualization, abnormal concentrations of intrauterine free radicals.
• Increase in JZ can be significantly correlated with implantation failure at IVF.
• There are a few reports of higher miscarriage rates in patients with adenomyosis as
compared to controls following IVF.
• However, evidence from recipients of sibling oocytes in IVF suggests that adenomyosis has
no impact on the rate of embryonic implantation.

Management

• Uterine artery embolization – pregnancy and
vaginal delivery has been reported in a small
case series.
• High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) – the
safety of transvaginal HIFU is currently being
assessed. One case of successful pregnancy has
been reported.

• GnRHa – no reports on successful pregnancies
following treatment with GnRHa for adenomyosis.
• LNG-IUS – no successful subsequent pregnancies
have been reported to date.
• Danazol-loaded IUD – 3 pregnancies have been
reported following its use.

What not to do

• Microsurgical resection of the visible adenomyotic area – (case reports)
followed by treatment with GnRHa resulted in the birth of healthy
newborns in 4 cases. It is suggested that this cytoreductive surgery
results in an increased sensitivity to hormonal treatment due to
improved blood supply to the adenomyosis tissue and an improved
immune function of the host.
• Risk of surgical and obstetric complications – antepartum bleeding,
threatened PTL, and intra-abdominal adhesions.
• Suggested approach – early combined GnRHa treatment after
cytoreductive surgery and a delay of 4–6 months before attempting to
become pregnant may help to achieve pregnancy.

• Routine myometrial biopsy of the uterine wall.
• GnRHa – long-term use.
• Danazol – long-term use.

Disorders of menstruation

CHAPTER 12 Endometriosis

Background and definition

Prevalence and incidence

• Definition – presence of endometrial-like tissue outside the uterus, which induces a chronic inflammatory reaction.
• Most commonly affected sites are the pelvic organs and peritoneum (uterosacral ligaments, pouch of Douglas,
rectovaginal septum, and ovaries). Extra-pelvic deposits such as the lungs, caesarean section scar, and the bowel are
occasionally seen.
• Extent of the disease varies from a few, small lesions on otherwise normal pelvic organs to large ovarian endometriotic
cysts (endometriomas), extensive fibrosis in structures such as the uterosacral ligaments, and adhesion formation
causing marked distortion of pelvic anatomy.
• All classification systems for endometriosis are subjective and correlate poorly with pain symptoms but may be of value
in infertility prognosis and management.

• Prevalence – 5–10% among the general female population.
• Present in 20–30% of women undergoing investigations for
subfertility and in 1–5% of women undergoing sterilization.
• In women with dysmenorrhoea or chronic pelvic pain, the
incidence of endometriosis is 40–60%.
• Pathogenesis – poorly understood.
• Theories:
* Retrograde menstruation.
* Peritoneal metaplasia.
* Lymphatic or blood-borne
dissemination.

History
• Asymptomatic – incidental finding.
• Symptoms – nonspecific:
* Secondary dysmenorrhoea (usually before or during menstruation). * Deep dyspareunia.
* Chronic pelvic pain.
* Infertility.
* Cyclical or perimenstrual symptoms, such as bowel or bladder, with or without abnormal bleeding or pain.
* Dyschezia (pain on defecation). * Painful caesarean section scar.
• Predictive value of any one symptom or set of symptoms is uncertain, as each of these symptoms can overlap with other
causes such as IBS and PID.

Examination
• Can be entirely normal.
• Speculum examination – visible lesions may be seen in the vagina or on the cervix.
• Pelvic examination – there may be:
* A fixed, retroverted uterus. * Enlarged ovaries.
* Tender adnexae/uterosacral
ligaments.
* Deeply infiltrating nodules may be palpable on the uterosacral ligaments or
in the pouch of Douglas.
• Detection of nodules is improved by performing the examination during menstruation.

Risks or complications
•
•
•
•

Dysmenorrhoea.
Chronic pelvic pain.
Subfertility.
Can impact on general physical, mental, and social wellbeing.

Differential diagnosis – chronic pelvic pain
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Primary dysmenorrhoea.
Adenomyosis.
• Uterine fibroids.
Adhesions.
• PID.
Congenital anomalies of the reproductive tract.
Interstitial cystitis or recurrent UTIs.
IBS or other bowel pathology.
Cancer (of the cervix, uterus, ovary, rectum, or bladder).
Musculoskeletal disorders.

Empirical treatment
• Empirical treatment of pain symptoms without a definitive diagnosis – a therapeutic trial
of a hormonal drug to reduce menstrual flow is appropriate.
• Counselling, analgesia, progestogens, or the COCs.
• GnRHa may be taken short term.

Endometrioma

http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/CBO9781316156513.013

Investigations

Laparoscopy

Others

• ‘Gold standard’ – allows visual inspection of the pelvis;
palpate lesions to determine their nodularity; document the
type, location, and extent of all lesions and adhesions.
• Insufficient evidence to justify scheduling the laparoscopy for
a specific time in the menstrual cycle.
• Do not perform during or within 3 months of hormonal
treatment, to avoid under-diagnosis.

• Serum CA125 level – may be elevated in endometriosis; has no value as a diagnostic tool.
• Histology: * Positive histology confirms diagnosis; negative histology does not exclude it.
* Peritoneal disease – visual inspection is usually adequate but histological confirmation is ideal.
* Ovarian endometrioma (> 3 cm in diameter) and in deeply infiltrating disease, obtain histology to
identify endometriosis and to exclude rare cases of malignancy.
• TVS – limited value in diagnosing peritoneal endometriosis but is useful in diagnosis of ovarian
endometrioma. May have a role in the diagnosis of disease involving bladder or rectum.
• MRI – to assess disease extent, if there is clinical evidence of deeply infiltrating endometriosis, ureteric,
bladder, and bowel involvement.
Management of severe/deeply infiltrating disease is complex. Surgery is usually
required and multiple organs are sometimes involved. Referral to a centre with the
necessary expertise to offer all available treatments in an MDT is recommended.

Management

Pelvic pain

Suspected endometrioma

Manage as ovarian cyst – see Chapter 36.

Medical management

Analgesics

• NSAIDs – inconclusive evidence to show whether NSAIDs are effective in
managing pain caused by endometriosis and whether any one NSAID is more
effective than another.
* Adverse GI side effects including gastric ulceration. Ibuprofen has a lower
risk; naproxen and diclofenac are associated with an intermediate risk;
mefenamic acid is likely to be associated with a low-to-intermediate risk.
• Paracetamol – no evidence of benefit.
• Codeine – no direct evidence of benefit. Add codeine in women who are unable
to take NSAID or who do not get adequate pain relief from paracetamol and
NSAID.

Complementary medicine
See page 57.

Hormonal drugs

• Suppression of ovarian function for 6 months reduces pain. Aim is to induce atrophy of ectopic
endometrium, and reduce pain by reducing menstrual blood flow or by inducing amenorrhoea.
• Hormonal manipulation does not affect the primary biological mechanisms of the disease
process. Therefore, medical treatment does not always provide complete pain relief.
• Symptom recurrence is common.
• Drugs (COCs, danazol, gestrinone, MPA, GnRHa) – equally effective but differ in their adverse
effect and cost profile. Duration of therapy is determined by the choice of drug, response to
treatment, and adverse effect. The COCs and Depo-Provera can be used long term but the use
of danazol and GnRH agonists is restricted to 6 months owing to their side effects.

SECTION 2

Disorders of menstruation

Hormonal drugs

Progestogen

• Consider progestogen if the COC is
contraindicated: MPA, NET, POP, LNG-IUS,
Norplant. If symptom relief is not obtained
after a 3–6 month trial, consider switching to an
alternative hormonal method.
• LNG-IUS – systematic review – reduces pain with
symptom control maintained over 3 years.

COCs – first-line

Know your drug

COCs can be taken conventionally, continuously, or in a tricycle regimen.

See Chapter 9: Heavy menstrual bleeding.

Androgens (danazol and gestrinone)

• Mechanism – inhibit ovarian steroidogenesis, resulting in decreased
secretion of oestradiol. Androgenic, anti-oestrogenic, and antiprogestogenic activity; cause amenorrhoea with a reversible
postmenopausal state.
Danazol – derivative of synthetic steroid ethisterone, a modified
testosterone.
• Indications – HMB, endometriosis, fibrocystic breast disease, breast pain
(mastodynia), and hereditary angioedema.
• Typical dose – 100–200 mg orally twice a day.
• Side effects (androgenic) – hirsutism, acne, oily skin, deepening of voice.
• Contraindications – pregnancy, as it can masculinize a female fetus.

GnRHa

• Mechanism – induces a reversible postmenopausal
state and regression of endometriotic deposits.
• It appears to be as effective as other medical
treatments in relieving the pain, but evidence is
limited.
• Limited use owing to loss of up to 6% of bone
mineral density (BMD) in the first 6 months. If
this treatment is to be used for > 6 months, then
use HRT ‘add-back’ therapy.

GnRHa with ‘add-back’

• Use of a GnRHa with ‘add-back’ therapy protects against BMD during treatment
and for up to 6 months after treatment.
• Add-back therapy involves taking any of:
* A low-dose oestrogen and progestin.
* Danazol.
* Tibolone (synthetic steroid, which mimics the activity of oestrogen and
progesterone).
* Calcium-regulating agents (calcitonin).
• Oestrogen and progestogen or oestrogen alone – systematic review – BMD is
significantly higher in women taking oestrogen and progestogen or oestrogen alone
as ‘add-back’ compared with a GnRH agonist alone. In addition, hypo-oestrogenic
adverse effects are significantly less severe in women who received ‘add-back’.

• Progestogen-only add-back therapy is not effective.
• Danazol add-back therapy is effective; however, its adverse effects limit its use.
• Tibolone – a small RCT showed significant benefit with tibolone in preventing
BMD loss. The daily frequency of hot flushes is significantly lower in the
tibolone group.
• Calcium-regulating agents (calcitonin) – insufficient evidence.
• How long a GnRH agonist plus ‘add-back’ may be continued safely is unclear,
but treatment for up to 12 months with combined oestrogen and progestogen
‘add-back’ appears to be effective and safe in terms of pain relief and BMD
protection.
• Carefully consider the use of GnRH agonists in women who may not have
reached their maximum BMD.

Surgical treatment for endometriosis-related pain

Radical (when continuing fertility is no longer required)

Conservative (minimally invasive when fertility is required):
• Ideal practice is to diagnose and remove endometriosis surgically.
• Aim – to remove (excise) or destroy (ablate) areas of endometriosis to improve symptoms.

Mild to moderate:

Severe and deeply infiltrating disease:

• Ablation and/or excision of endometriotic lesions
reduce pain compared with diagnostic laparoscopy
alone.
• However, some women fail to respond to surgical
treatment either because of incomplete excision,
postoperative recurrence, or because some of their
pain was not due to endometriosis in the first place.

• Excisional surgery involves removing the entire lesions, and
results in significant symptomatic improvement as well as general
improvement in QOL. Associated with high morbidity.
• Refer to specialized tertiary endometriosis centres with
experienced surgeons and MDT care (gynaecologists,
radiologists, colorectal surgeons, urologists, anaesthetic pain
specialists, and psychologists).

• Laparoscopic uterine nerve ablation does not reduce
endometriosis-associated pain or dysmenorrhoea
associated with endometriosis.
• Laparoscopic helium plasma coagulation – used to
vaporize endometriotic deposits. Current evidence
on the safety and efficacy of this procedure is not
adequate to recommend its use outside research.

• HRT pre- or postoperatively has no evidence of benefit.
• In a small RCT, the LNG-IUS inserted after laparoscopic surgery
significantly reduced the risk of recurrent moderate–severe
dysmenorrhoea at 1-year follow-up.

Complementary medicine
• Nutritional and complementary therapies such as homeopathy, reflexology,
traditional Chinese medicine, or herbal treatments may improve pain symptoms.
• While there is no evidence from RCTs in endometriosis to support these
treatments, they should not be ruled out if the woman feels that they could be
beneficial to her overall pain management and/or QOL, or work in conjunction
with more traditional therapies.

57

• TAH + BSO – hysterectomy and removal of all visible endometriotic tissue, BSO may result in
improved pain relief and a reduced chance of future surgery.
• HRT after BSO – owing to the overall health benefits and small risk of recurrent disease while taking
HRT, advise HRT after BSO in young women.
• Ideal regimen is unclear. There is no good evidence on the type of regimen. These are unopposed
oestrogen, combined-continuous regimen, or tibolone. Unopposed oestrogen may reactivate any
residual disease. Adding a progestogen is unnecessary but may protect against the unopposed action
of oestrogen on any residual disease.
• Adenocarcinoma arising from endometriosis has been reported in women treated with unopposed
oestrogen. Limited evidence suggests that combined HRT is associated with a lower risk of
malignant change than treatment with unopposed oestrogens.
• Balance the theoretical benefit of avoiding disease reactivation or malignant transformation against the
risk of increase in breast cancer associated with combined oestrogen and progestogen HRT and tibolone.

SECTION 2

Follow-up – relapse

Disorders of menstruation

Endometriosis and infertility
Suggested mechanism for subfertility

• Systematic review – the absolute benefit on pain relief at short-term follow-up
(6 months–1 year) is 30–40%. Relapse is also common after surgical
procedures, and up to 50% of women need analgesics or hormonal treatment
at 1 year.
• Long-term follow-up – repeat surgery rate up to 50%.
• Managing relapse – explain that relapse is common.
* Exclude other conditions with similar symptoms.
* Options: NSAIDs and/or medical treatment (such as COCs). Further
hormonal treatment under specialist supervision.
* Consider repeat surgery.

• Mild–moderate – precise mechanism unclear. Theories:
* Altered peritoneal milieu may destroy oocytes and spermatozoa and impair fertilization.
* Increased peritoneal prostaglandin concentrations may interfere with ovulation, tubal peristalsis, sperm
motility, or uterine contractility, thereby interfering with implantation.
• Severe – adhesions and resulting fibrosis may distort the anatomy of Fallopian tubes and ovaries, thereby
impeding the capture of oocytes.
* Ovarian endometriomas may be extensive and can destroy normal ovarian tissue, causing anovulation.
* Pelvic pain and dyspareunia may discourage or reduce coital frequency.
• Effect of endometriosis on IVF – systematic review – IVF pregnancy rates are lower in women with
endometriosis than in those with tubal infertility, predominantly owing to decreased fertilization and
implantation rates secondary to abnormalities in oocyte quality and early embryo development. However,
ESHRE guidelines reported that endometriosis does not appear to affect pregnancy rates adversely.

Endometriosis and infertility management

Expectant
Mild–moderate – couples conceive sponta-

neously with a monthly fecundity rate of
5–10%. An expectant approach is appropriate in these couples for up to 2 years.
Severe – probability of spontaneous
pregnancy appears to be significantly low
with a monthly fecundity rate of approximately 3% or less. Role of expectant
management is therefore limited.

Medical management
• Suppression of ovarian function to improve fertility
in minimal–mild or severe endometriosis is not
effective. More harm than good may result from
treatment, because of adverse effects and the lost
opportunity to conceive.

Evidence round-up – pre- or post-surgical hormonal treatment
• Insufficient evidence to suggest that hormonal suppression in association with surgery will
benefit eradication of endometriosis, improve symptoms and pregnancy rates.
• Cochrane review – • Pre-surgical medical treatment (goserelin) improved fertility compared
with surgery alone (1 study), • Compared with surgery alone, post-surgical medical treatment
was no better at 12 months (5 studies). • There was no significant difference in pain, disease
recurrence, or pregnancy rates.

Surgical management
Minimal–mild disease – laparoscopic ablation plus adhesiolysis may improve
the chance of pregnancy, but the evidence is limited.
Moderate–severe disease – excision/ablation of all visible endometriosis and
adhesions, to correct pelvic anatomy. Role of surgery is uncertain. No RCTs
are available. There seems to be a negative correlation between the stage of
endometriosis and the spontaneous pregnancy rate after surgical removal
of endometriosis. Women may improve their chance of conceiving with
conservative surgical treatment. (ASRM, 2006)
Ovarian endometriomas • Drainage. • Ablation. • Excision.
• Risks – recurrence, damaging ovarian reserve secondary to excision of
the capsule or to the use of electrosurgery.
• Do not perform simple drainage as it has a high risk of recurrence.
• Ablation may carry a higher risk of recurrence and it may result in
greater damage to ovarian follicular reserve.
• Laparoscopic excision is better than drainage and ablation. The risk
of recurrence and symptoms are reduced compared to drainage and
ablation. Subsequent spontaneous pregnancy rates are also improved.
• Cochrane review – excision of the endometrioma is preferable to
drainage and ablation in regard to recurrence of symptoms, recurrence
of endometrioma, and spontaneous pregnancy rates.

http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/CBO9781316156513.013

Assisted reproduction

• Intrauterine insemination (IUI) with gonadotrophins in minimal to
mild endometriosis is not recommended.
• IVF – indicated:
* Especially if tubal function is compromised, there is also male
factor infertility, and/or other treatments have failed.
* Couples with minimal or mild endometriosis and infertility of
2 years’ duration or longer.
* Refer early – women with moderate or severe disease where
there is a high chance of impaired tubal-ovarian anatomy.

• Hormonal treatment before IVF – limited evidence – Cochrane review
(1 RCT) – CPR per woman is significantly higher in women receiving
GnRHa for 3–6 months before IVF compared with controls.
• Surgical treatment of endometriomas before IVF – no RCTs comparing
laparoscopic excision with no treatment before IVF.
• Ovarian cystectomy – laparoscopic ovarian cystectomy is recommended if
ovarian endometriomas are > 4 cm in size, to:
* Reduce risk of infection.
* Possibly improve ovarian response.
* Improve access to follicles.
* Improve ease of monitoring.
* Prevent endometriosis progression.
* However, it is associated with the risks of surgical complications,
possibility of reducing ovarian reserve, and risk of loss of the ovary.

What not to do
• Diagnostic laparoscopy during or within 3 months of hormonal treatment.
• Serum CA125 levels as a diagnostic tool.
• Laparoscopic uterine nerve ablation, presacral neurectomy, laparoscopic helium plasma
coagulation.
• HRT before or after surgery.
• Expectant management in severe disease.
• Suppression of ovarian function to improve fertility in minimal–mild endometriosis.
• Medical management in more severe disease.
• Endometrioma – simple fenestration with drainage.
• Postoperative hormonal treatment has no beneficial effect on pregnancy rates after surgery.

Reproductive medicine

CHAPTER 13 Disorders of sexual development (DSD)
Congenital conditions with atypical development of chromosomal, gonadal, or anatomical sex

Nomenclature
Background

prevalence

• DSD is defined as genital ambiguity at birth or late onset.
• Psychosexual development is influenced by multiple factors such as exposure to
androgens, sex chromosome genes, as well as social circumstance and family dynamics.
• Incidence of genital ambiguity is 1/4500 although some degree of male undervirilization
or female virilization may be present in as many as 2% of live births.

• International Consensus Conference 2006 nomenclature:
* Male pseudohermaphrodite, undervirilization/undermasculinization of XY male – 46,XY DSD.
* Female pseudohermaphrodite, overvirilization/masculinization of XX female – 46,XX DSD.
* True hermaphrodite – ovotesticular DSD.
* XX male or XX sex reversal – 46,XX testicular DSD.
* XY sex reversal – 46,XY complete gonadal dysgenesis.

Features that suggest DSD
History
• Obstetric history: any evidence of endocrine disturbance during pregnancy. History of maternal
virilization may suggest a maternal androgen secreting tumour or aromatase deficiency. Use of
any drugs in pregnancy that may cause virilization of a female fetus.
• Previous neonatal deaths (which might suggest an undiagnosed adrenal crisis).
• Family history:
* Whether the parents are consanguineous (increased risk of autosomal recessive condition).
* History of genital ambiguity, abnormal pubertal development, or infertility (X-linked
recessive condition such as androgen insensitivity).
• Gestation of the baby – in preterm girls, the clitoris and labia minora are relatively prominent; in
boys, the testes are usually undescended until about 34 weeks’ gestation.

General physical examination
• Any dysmorphic features (syndromes associated with ambiguous genitalia).
• Hypoglycaemia – cortisol deficiency secondary to hypothalamic, pituitary or adrenocortical
insufficiency.
• State of hydration and BP – as various forms of CAH can be associated with differing
degrees of salt loss or hypertension. Although the cardiovascular collapse with salt loss and
hyperkalaemia in CAH does not usually occur until between the 4th and 15th day of life, it
should be anticipated until CAH has been excluded.
• Jaundice (both conjugated and unconjugated) may be caused by concomitant thyroid
hormone or cortisol deficiency.
• Urine for protein as a screen for any associated renal anomaly.
• Hyperpigmentation, especially of the genital skin and nipples, occurs in the presence of
excessive ACTH and pro-opiomelanocortin, and may be apparent in CAH.

• Most causes of DSD are recognized in the neonatal period:
* Overt genital ambiguity.
* Apparent female genitalia with an enlarged clitoris, posterior labial fusion, or an
inguinal/labial mass.
* Apparent male genitalia with bilateral undescended testes in a full-term infant,
micropenis, isolated perineal hypospadias; mild hypospadias with undescended
testis; hypospadias associated with separation of the scrotal sacs.
* Discordance between genital appearance and a prenatal karyotype.
• Later presentations in older children and young adults include:
* Previously unrecognized genital ambiguity.
* Inguinal hernia in a female. * Virilization in a female.
* Delayed or incomplete puberty. * Primary amenorrhoea.
* Breast development in a male. * Gross and occasionally cyclic haematuria in a
male.

Examination of external genitalia
• Whether gonads are palpable and the degree of virilization.
• Gonads – if both gonads are palpable, they are likely to be testes (or ovotestes), which
may be normal or dysgenetic. They may be situated high in the inguinal canal, so careful
examination is required.
• Penis – assess length of the phallus. A well-developed phallus indicates that significant
levels of circulating testosterone were present in utero.
• Chordee – this may decrease the apparent length of the phallus, and the penis may be
‘buried’ in some cases.
• Urethral meatus – check for presence of hypospadias and the position of the urethral
meatus.
• Note degree of fusion and rugosity of the labioscrotal folds and the presence or absence of
a separate vaginal opening.

Development and sexual differentiation
The urogenital ridge develops from the mesonephros, which also contains the cells that are the precursors for
follicular or Sertoli cells and steroid-producing theca and Leydig cells.

Development of the fetal adrenals and gonads occur in parallel; the
potential steroidogenic cells of both originate from the mesonephros.

At about 4 weeks after fertilization, primordial germ cells
migrate from the yolk sac wall to the urogenital ridge.

The undifferentiated gonads form on the ­genital
ridges and are capable of developing into either
an ovary or a testis.

Testicular development is an active process – requires expression of
primary testis-determining gene SRY (on Y chromosome).

The theory of the ‘default’ programme generating an ovary
is probably not correct, although the exact role of ‘ovarian-­
determining’ genes is unclear at present.

• The only source of AMH in the fetus
is the testes; the absence of a uterus
in a baby with ambiguous genitalia is
evidence that there has been functional
testicular tissue present.
• External male genitalia – the degree
of masculinization is determined by
the amount of fetal androgen present
(irrespective of source) and the
ability of the tissues to respond to the
androgens.

CHAPTER 13

Defects in any part of this pathway
(including gene mutations, chromosomal
abnormalities, inappropriate hormone
levels, or end-organ unresponsiveness) may
result in genital ambiguity. This may be
with undervirilization of an XY individual,
virilization of an XX individual, or the
very rare true hermaphrodite.

SECTION 3

Reproductive medicine

Investigations – first-line investigations to ascertain whether the child is an undervirilized male or a virilized female

• Karyotype – with SRY detection.
Full karyotype for confirmation and exclusion of
mosaicism. The latter may be tissue specific and
may not be apparent from blood, but only from
skin or gonadal biopsies.

•
•
•
•
•

• hCG stimulation test – to determine whether functioning Leydig cells
are present, to delineate a block in testosterone biosynthesis from
androstenedione (17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase deficiency) or
conversion of testosterone to DHT (5α-reductase deficiency).
• AMH and inhibin-B levels – AMH and inhibin-B are secreted by the Sertoli
cells. AMH is undetectable in female serum until the onset of puberty.
AMH may be a more sensitive marker for the presence of testicular tissue
than serum testosterone levels. Basal inhibin-B gives reliable information
about both the presence and function of the testes.

17-hydroxyprogesterone, testosterone.
Serum and urine electrolytes.
Gonadotrophins – raised basal gonadotrophins are consistent with primary gonadal failure.
Adrenal steroid biosynthesis – ACTH stimulation tests.
Urinary steroid analysis – output of adrenal steroids will be low in adrenal insufficiency. In CAH,
specific ratios of metabolites will be altered, depending on the level of the enzyme block.

• Determination of internal anatomy of uterus, ovaries.
• Ultrasound also helps to exclude renal anomalies,
to visualize the adrenal glands, and to locate
inguinal gonads, although it is not sensitive for
intra-abdominal gonads.
• EUA/cystoscopy or urogenital sonogram/MRI.
• Laparoscopy to confirm anatomy of the internal
genitalia and to take gonadal biopsies.

• Skin and gonadal biopsies
Genital skin biopsies to establish cell lines for androgen receptor binding
assays and analysis of 5α-reductase activity.
Gonadal biopsies are essential for dysgenesis and true hermaphroditism.

SECTION 3

Reproductive medicine

Management

General concepts of care

Gender assignment in newborns

Surgical management

• Tertiary centre (MDT) – paediatric
subspecialists in endocrinology, surgery,
urology, genetics, neonatology, psychology/
psychiatry, gynaecology, nursing, and
medical ethics.
• Psychosocial management to promote
positive adaptation.

• Avoid gender assignment before expert evaluation of
newborn. However, it should be made as quickly as
thorough diagnostic evaluation permits.
• Factors that influence gender assignment – diagnosis,
genital appearance, therapeutic options, need for lifelong
replacement therapy, potential for fertility, views of the
family, and sometimes circumstances relating to cultural
practices.
• Recommendations are to raise infants with
* 46,XY CAIS and 46,XX CAH as females.
* 5α-reductase or 17-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase-3
deficiency as males.

• Emphasis is on functional outcome rather than a
cosmetic appearance. Rationale for early reconstruction
includes beneficial effects of oestrogen on infant tissues,
avoiding complications from anatomical anomalies,
minimizing family concern and distress, and mitigating
the risks of stigmatization and gender-identity
confusion of atypical genital appearance.
• However, surgical reconstruction in infancy might need
to be refined at the time of puberty.

Sex-steroid replacement

Risk of gonadal tumour

• Germ cell malignancy only occurs in patients who have
Y-chromosomal material.
• Highest risk (up to 60%) is in patients with gonadal dysgenesis
and partial AIS with intra-abdominal gonads. Remove intraabdominal gonads of high-risk patients at diagnosis.
• Lowest risk (< 5%) is found in ovotestis and genetically
confirmed CAIS.
• Perform gonadal biopsy at puberty in patients with DSD raised
as males with scrotal gonads.

• Hypogonadism is common in patients with
dysgenetic gonads, defects in sex-steroid
biosynthesis, and resistance to androgens.
• Hormonal induction of puberty to induce
secondary sexual characteristics, pubertal
growth spurt, and optimal bone mineral
accumulation.
• Route – IM depot injections, oral, and
transdermal.
• PAIS may need supra-physiological doses of
testosterone for optimal effect.
• Females with hypogonadism – supplement
oestrogen to induce pubertal changes and
menses. Add a progestin after breakthrough
bleeding develops or within 1–2 years of
continuous oestrogen.

Fertility – females with an adequately formed uterus and males with evidence of functional seminiferous tubules
may have fertility potential with assisted-reproduction techniques.
• Fertility-potential considerations include:
* Expected fertility in virilized females with a well-developed uterus and ovaries.
* Unlikely fertility in undermasculinized males without assisted-reproduction techniques.
* Fertility in some patients with ovotesticular DSD.

Masculinizing genital surgery:

• Involves more surgical procedures and difficulties than
feminizing genitoplasty.
• Repair involving hypospadias includes chordee
correction, urethral reconstruction, and testosterone
supplementation.
• If needed, adult-sized testicular prostheses can be
inserted after sufficient pubertal scrotal development.
Feminizing genital surgery:

• External genitalia reconstruction and vaginal
exteriorization, with early separation of the vagina and
urethra.
• Consider clitoral reduction in severe virilization, and
perform in conjunction with common urogenital sinus
repair.
• Do not advise vaginal dilatation during childhood.
Perform vaginoplasty in the teenage years; it has
potential for scarring that would require modification
before sexual function.

•
•
•

Most common cause of female DSD.
Autosomal recessive.
Enzyme deficiency related to the biosynthesis of cortisol and aldosterone.
Severe enzyme deficiency – ambiguous genitalia in the newborn due to virilization.

SECTION 3

Reproductive medicine

Masculinization in XX females
46,XX DSD

Placental aromatase deficiency

CAH

• The majority of virilized 46,XX infants will have CAH.
• Classical – newborn with ambiguous genitalia. Enlarged clitoris and excessive fusion of the labioscrotal
folds, which obscure the vagina and urethra, with a single opening at some point on the perineum,
usually near the base of the clitoris, although sometimes along its ventral surface, and rarely at the tip.
Thickening and rugosity of the labia majora with some resemblance to a scrotum. The uterus, Fallopian
tubes, and vagina are always present and the vagina opens at some point in the urogenital sinus.
• Non-classical (late onset) – accounts for up to 2–20% of women presenting with hirsutism and
ologomenorrhoea. May mimic PCOS. 17-OH progesterone is less elevated. Perform ACTH stimulation
test with measurement of 17-OH progesterone.
Treatment:
• Glucocorticoids replace glucocorticoid deficit and decrease ACTH secretion. Avoid over treatment, as
it may cause linear growth restriction, delayed puberty, and cushingoid signs. Infants – hydrocortisone
twice daily. Adults – prednisolone.
• Mineralocorticoid replacement with fludrocorticosone.
• Clitoral reduction, vaginoplasty with correction of labial fusion and anomalous urethral position.
Timing of surgery is advised to delay until adolescence.
• Women are fertile with adequate replacement therapy.
• Risk of autosomal recessive condition being passed on the to next generation.

Maternal source of virilization

Other causes of masculinization in genetic females:
• Androgen-secreting tumours that have occurred in pregnancy, which have resulted in
virilization of the fetus.
• The association between the use of progestogens and masculinization of the fetus is
extremely rare.
• Management is to exclude CAH.
• Reared in female role.
• If no source of androgen can be identified, consideration must consider gonadal
biopsy be given to the possibility of the child being a 46,XX true hermaphrodite, and
if the degree of external masculinization is considerable.

21-Hydroxylase deficiency

•
•
•
•

90% of cases.
Incidence – 1/5000 to 1/15,000.
Gene on short arm of chromosome 6.
Results in a failure of conversion of 17α-hydroxyprogesterone to desoxycortisol and progesterone to
desoxycorticosterone, leading to increased progesterone and 17α-hydroxyprogesterone (raised 50–400 times),
which is therefore converted to androstenedione and subsequently to testosterone. Also results in insufficient
cortisol production, stimulating increased production of corticotrophin-releasing hormone and ACTH. High
ACTH levels lead to adrenal hyperplasia and production of excess androgens.
• Symptoms of excessive androgens are found in varied degrees depending on the severity of the enzyme defect.
• Severe deficiency – adrenal aldosterone secretion is insufficient to stimulate sodium re-absorption by the distal renal
tubules, resulting in salt-wasting (seen in one third of cases) as well as cortisol deficiency, in addition to androgen
excess. The child may die of wasting and vomiting within a few weeks of life due to this salt-losing syndrome.
• Prenatal treatment with daily dexamethasone may reduce the virilization process.

11β-Hydroxylase deficiency

• Second most common.
• Gene on chromosome 8.
• May present with virilization, hypertension, and hypokalaemia.
Hypertension is secondary to increase in 11-deoxycortisol and
deoxycorticosterone (mineralocorticoid).
• High levels of 17-OH progesterone, 11-deoxycortisol, and
deoxycorticosterone.

http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/CBO9781316156513.014

Undervirilization in XY females
46,XY DSD

Gonadal dysgenesis/anatomical testicular failure

Enzymatic testicular failure

• Failure of normal testicular differentiation and development
may be the result of a chromosome mosaicism affecting the sex
chromosomes but usually the sex chromosomes appear to be normal.
• Most patients have mild masculinization or none at all and,
generally, the uterus, Fallopian tubes, and vagina are present.
• Degree of masculinization is often minimal and is limited to a minor
clitoral enlargement with little or no fusion of the genital
folds. Generally does not need surgery.
• Risk of malignancy in the rudimentary testes is about 30%, therefore
gonadal removal during childhood is recommended.
• Around the age of puberty, replace oestrogen–progestogen therapy to
induce secondary sexual development and menstruation.

• A number of biosynthetic defects can occur at each stage of the
testosterone biosynthesis process.
• Clinical features are varied, but as such enzyme defects are
incomplete generally, there is external genital ambiguity of varying
degree.
• Uterus, Fallopian tubes, and upper vagina are absent as the
production of MIS is normal.
• Decision on the sex of rearing depends on the degree of
masculinization of the external genitalia but the female role is
often chosen.
• hCG stimulation with measurement of various androgens helps to
determine the site of the enzyme block.

5α-Reductase deficiency

• Autosomal recessive, history of other affected family members.
• Normal masculinization of the external genitalia requires the conversion
of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone by 5α-reductase. The Wolffian
structures respond directly to testosterone, therefore internal organs
will be male. Uterus, Fallopian tubes, and upper vagina will always be
absent because MIS production is normal. There is deficient or absent
breast development, yet normal or increased pubic and axillary hair.
• Male infant will have poor masculinization of external genitalia.
• As a rule, the degree of genital masculinization is small or at worst
moderate, and most children are initially placed in the female role. At
puberty, however, the testes produce increased amounts of testosterone
and there is greater virilization.
• Penis size is barely adequate and female gender role is often better.
• Test – hCG stimulation of the gonad – elevated testosterone to DHT
ratio.
Phenotypic males with 46,XX karyotype are rarely found. Those who have
been appropriately examined have been shown to be H-Y antigen positive
and there is little clinical ambiguity in this group, the external genitalia being
generally normal, although underdeveloped, and hypospadias may be present.
Isolated deficiency of Müllerian inhibition has also been reported but such
cases do not present clinically as examples of doubtful sex, unless some
unrelated surgical procedure reveals the surprising presence of Müllerian
structures in an otherwise normal or near normal male.

67

End-organ insensitivity

Androgen insensitivity

•
•
•
•

Incidence 1/60,000 male births.
X-linked recessive.
Karyotype – 46,XY.
Testosterone levels are normal, but there is insensitivity to secreted androgens owing to complete absence of the
gene for the androgen receptor or to mutations in the gene. The condition may be complete in patients who have an
absent androgen receptor or, in some cases, where the androgen receptor mutation is not complete, some receptivity
may persist and partial androgenization may occur.
• Patients present at or after puberty, but sometimes may be seen earlier in childhood if the defect is incomplete or
when a testis is found to occupy a hernial sac.
Complete androgen insensitivity (CAIS):
• Present at or after puberty with primary amenorrhoea despite normal breast development. Absent or scanty
pubic and axillary hair, normal vulva but a short blind vagina with no cervix. Antimüllerian factor prevents the
development of müllerian structures, therefore no uterus, Fallopian tubes. External genitalia appear female.
• Wolffian structures also fail to develop because of the insensitivity to testosterone.
Partial androgen insensitivity (PAIS): In about 10% of patients the defect is incomplete. The external genitalia may be
ambiguous at birth, and virilization may occur before puberty.
Management – depends upon the age at which the patient is seen.
• If seen after puberty when breast development is complete, undertake gonadectomy owing to increased risk of
cancer (5%). Provide HRT with oestrogen; need not be cyclical because the uterus is absent.
• If the patient is seen for the first time in childhood, feminization will occur at puberty and nothing needs to be done until
that time. If, however, there are heterosexual features, it is very likely that masculinization will occur to some extent at
puberty. This will have a profound psychological effect on the patient when she has been brought up in the female role.
In these circumstances, advise gonadectomy in childhood and induction of puberty with HRT at the appropriate time.
• Surgery is seldom necessary to elongate the vagina as it is usually functional, but if required, graduated dilatation
using Frank’s procedure is the treatment of choice.

CHAPTER 14 Primary amenorrhoea
Failure to establish menstruation by:
• 16 years of age in girls with normal secondary sexual characteristics (SSC).
• 14 years of age in girls with no secondary sexual characteristics.

History
• Sexual history, exclude pregnancy.
• Cyclical lower abdominal pain – haematocolpos (genital tract malformation).
• Stress, depression, weight loss, disturbance of perception of weight or shape, level of
exercise, and chronic systemic illness – hypothalamic dysfunction.
• Headache, visual disturbance, or galactorrhoea – prolactinoma.
• Family history of late menarche – constitutional delay.
• Family history of autoimmune disorders, premature menopause, or genetic anomalies
(e.g., androgen insensitivity).
• Medication (such as antipsychotic), previous chemotherapy or radiotherapy, and illicit
drug use (opiates and cocaine).

Examination
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Height and weight (BMI).
Secondary sexual characteristics (Tanner staging).
Hirsutism, clitoromegaly, virilization, galactorrhoea.
Signs of thyroid and other endocrine disease.
External genitalia – haematocolpos.
Features of Turner’s syndrome, androgen insensitivity.
Pelvic examination – inappropriate in young girls who are not sexually active.

•

69

Trans-abdominal USS to assess pelvic anatomy – uterus, ovaries.
Karyotype.
Hormonal profile – FSH, LH, prolactin, TSH, testosterone.
Examination under anaesthesia.

Complications
• Oestrogen deficiency (premature ovarian failure, weight loss, anorexia nervosa, and excessive
exercise) – risk of osteoporosis. This increased risk persists even if normal menses are
resumed.
• Oestrogen deficiency in adolescents – desirable peak bone mass may not be attained.
• Oestrogen deficiency may increase risk of cardiovascular disease.
• Infertility.
• Unpredictable spontaneous ovulation may occur; therefore, contraception is needed.
• Psychological distress – anxiety, altered self-image, and loss of self-esteem.
• Women with a Y-chromosome – increased risk of gonadal tumours. Gonads (residual testes)
need removal either at diagnosis or, in women with androgen insensitivity after puberty.

Outflow tract obstruction

Mayer–Rokitansky–Kuster–Hauser syndrome

• Imperforate hymen: * Normal SSC. * Cyclical lower abdominal pain.
* Visible haematocolpos with a bulging purple/blue, stretching thin hymen at introitus.
* USS may show haematometra.
* Treatment – surgery – simple cruciate incision on the hymen.
• Transverse vaginal septum: * Owing to failure of fusion or canalization between the
Müllerian tubercle and sinovaginal bulb.
* Normal SSC. * Cyclical lower abdominal pain.
* Pink bulge at introitus as the septum is thicker than the hymen.
* Treatment – surgery (risk of annular constriction).

• 46,XX, normal female phenotype. • Incidence 1/5000 female births.
• Ovarian tissue functions normally, therefore normal SSC.
• Müllerian ducts fail to fuse. Uterine development is rudimentary or absent with uterine
remnants. Vaginal agenesis with short and blind ending vagina.
• External genitalia has normal appearance.
• May be associated with renal tract (15–40%) and skeletal anomalies (10–20%).
• Investigations – USS, laparoscopy.
• Treatment: Sexual function – gradual dilatation of vagina (Vecchetti procedure). Surgery
to create neovagina – McIndoe vaginoplasty, tissue expansion vaginoplasty, Williams
vaginoplasty. Fertility – oocytes retrieval and surrogacy.

Constitutional delay (physiologically delayed puberty)

• There is no anatomical abnormality, and maturation usually occurs spontaneously by 18
years of age.
• Familial.
• Diagnosis is by exclusion of pathological causes.

Kallman’s syndrome

Congenital gonadotrophin deficiency characterized by anosmia and other cranial anomalies.

Turner’s syndrome

• Most common cause of gonadal dysgenesis.
• Pubertal delay.
• 45,XO. Classical features – short stature, webbing of the neck, coitus valgus, widely
spaced nipples, cardiac and renal abnormality, autoimmune hypothyroidism.
• Mosaicism – spontaneous menstruation may occur, but leads to POF.
• Streak gonads.
• Treatment – low-dose oestrogen to promote breast development without affecting linear
growth. Cyclical oestrogen and progesterone treatment for maintenance.
• Fertility – egg donation.

Anorexia

• Weight 10–12% less than ideal body weight.
• Growth spurt usually occurs, but SSC are absent.
• Associated features – constipation, hypothermia, cold intolerance, bradycardia,
hypotension, lanugo-type hair.
• Low LH, FSH, E2; anaemia; ECG abnormality in 52%, abnormal GTT in 37% of cases.
• Dietary therapy, psychotherapy, antidepressants.
• Oestrogen replacement.

CHAPTER 15 Premature ovarian insufficiency (POI)

Background and prevalence
•
•
•
•

Risks or complications

Definition – menopause before the age of 40 years.
Diagnosis – FSH levels > 40 IU/ml and oestradiol level < 50 pmol/L. (EMAS)
Prevalence – 1% under the age of 40 years and 0.1% under the age of 30 years.
Two main mechanisms:
* dysfunction of follicular maturation.
* depletion in the follicular pool.

• Autoimmune oophoritis – adrenal cytoplasmic antibodies and
steroid cell antibodies found in idiopathic Addison’s disease and
autoimmune polyglandular syndrome are specifically toxic to
follicular granulosa cells.
• POI is frequently associated with autoimmune disorders,
including hypothyroidism (13.8%), IDDM (1.7%), and
antibodies including parietal cell antibodies (3.7%) and the
acetylcholine esterase antibodies seen in myasthenia gravis
(2.7%).

• Premature morbidity and mortality.
• Increased risk of:
* Osteoporosis.
* Cardiovascular disease.
* Dementia. * Depression.
* Cognitive decline and parkinsonism.

Aetiology

• Turner’s syndrome – due to accelerated
atresia of the primordial follicles during
later fetal life, the ovarian follicle pool is
depleted by the time of puberty and these
women present with primary amenorrhoea.
• Mosaic genotype (45,XO/46,XX); the rate
of atresia, although accelerated, is relatively
slower, and they present with secondary
amenorrhoea.
• 46,XY gonadal dysgenesis.

• Fragile-X syndrome permutation – the individual is
phenotypically normal.
• Mechanisms of POI are not clearly understood.

• Accumulation of toxic metabolites or immune mediated –
Galactosaemia – direct toxicity from galactose-1-phosphate and
galactitol; aberrant glycolysation of glycoproteins and glycolipids
involved in ovarian function; and activation of apoptosis of
oocytes and ovarian stromal cells.

• Iatrogenic – secondary to cancer treatment (surgical, radiotherapy,
or chemotherapy).
• Likelihood of POI depends on woman’s age and the dose of
radiation or chemotherapeutic agents used.
• 8% of all survivors of childhood cancers experience POI and this
increases to 30–40% among those who receive a combination of
radiotherapy and chemotherapy.

• Primary – idiopathic – 88%.

http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/CBO9781316156513.016

History
• Amenorrhoea or oligomenorrhoea – most common presentation is secondary amenorrhoea
with normal pubertal development. In 20% of cases, there is primary amenorrhoea with
pubertal development delay.
• Symptoms of oestrogen deficiency – vasomotor symptoms of hot flushes, night sweats, and
loss of libido.
• Past history of chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or pelvic surgery.
• History of autoimmune disorders, including hypothyroidism or adrenal insufficiency.
• Family history of POI (14–31% of cases) and a familial disorder can be identified, e.g.,
Perrault syndrome (XX gonadal dysgenesis with sensorineural deafness), FSH receptor
mutations, and fragile-X permutations.

Differential diagnosis
• Diagnose POI by excluding other common causes of
primary and secondary amenorrhoea.
• Rule out pregnancy.

Examination
• Height, weight, and BMI.
• Any dysmorphic features suggesting a chromosomal or genetic cause.
• Skin for hirsutism, acne, striae, acanthosis nigrans, and vitiligo.

Investigations

To confirm diagnosis

Second-line investigations – once the diagnosis of POI is confirmed

•
•
•
•
•

• Karyotyping and FMR-1 pre-mutation analysis.
• Screen for autoimmune diseases (anti-adrenal, anti-21-hydroxylase, anti-thyroid
peroxidase, and anti-thyroglobulin antibodies).
• Ovarian antibody screen.
• Antimüllerian hormone (AMH) to assess ovarian reserve.
• Ovarian biopsy – clinical significance is uncertain, as pregnancy has been reported even
when a specimen has shown an absence of follicles.
• Dual-emission X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan for baseline assessment, due to risk
of osteopenia.

75

Serum FSH, LH, and oestradiol. Repeat after 3–4 weeks to confirm diagnosis.
Endocrine screen for serum prolactin and thyroxine levels.
If there are signs of hyperandrogenism measure serum DHEA and testosterone.
USS to assess endometrial thickness, ovarian volume, and antral follicle count.
A progestogen withdrawal test has less clinical significance because approximately 50% of
women with secondary amenorrhoea and 20% with primary amenorrhoea will have withdrawal
bleeding. This can give women a sense of reassurance but may be misleading.

SECTION 3

Reproductive medicine

Management

Counselling, psychological support, and general measures

Oestrogen deficiency symptoms

Fertility management

• Provide information and counselling.
• Specialist premature menopause clinics – MDT
(counsellors, psychologists, endocrinologist, geneticist).
• General measures to avoid bone loss – physical activity, a
calcium-rich diet, vitamin D supplementation, and advice
to avoid smoking and alcohol.

• Prescribe HRT unless contraindicated, until the age of
menopause. Women may need a higher dose of oestrogen to
control vasomotor symptoms as compared to the women in
their fifties. (EMAS)
• Exogenous oestrogens have beneficial effects on cardiovascular
status and bone density; early treatment provides more longterm benefits.
• For women with a uterus, add a progestogen to avoid
unopposed effects of oestrogen on the endometrium.
• Regimen can be sequential or continuous. Sequential
administration has the advantage of simulating monthly
menstrual cycles. Continuous regimens avoid menstrual flow
but can lead to breakthrough bleeding.
• Combined COCs may be more acceptable in younger women.
• Lack of comparative data between COCs and HRT.
• Consider androgen replacement even with normal adrenal
function, as loss of ovarian activity can reduce androgen
production by 50%, which can have profound effects on
general and sexual wellbeing.

• Intermittent unpredictable ovarian function seen with
15% chance of spontaneous pregnancy.

No evidence that oestrogen replacement increases the
risk of breast cancer to a level greater than that found
in normally menstruating women; therefore, no need to
start earlier mammographic screen in women with POI
on HRT.

Fertility options

• Adoption, oocyte or embryo donation.
• Oestrogen suppression followed by exogenous
gonadotrophins – women with POI have chronically
high gonadotrophin levels, which downregulate FSH
receptors on granulosa cells, so that the remaining
follicles become refractory to exogenous stimulation.
Pre-treatment with oestrogens suppresses FSH serum
levels and allows the restoration of FSH receptors in
the remaining follicles. When this pre-treatment was
followed by exogenous gonadotrophin stimulation,
ovulation was reported in 32% and, among these,
pregnancy was achieved in 50% of cases (small case series).

Fertility preservation

Contraception

Non-hormonal treatment

• Women requiring chemotherapy or radiotherapy –
gonadal shielding, ovarian transposition, ovarian
suppression by GnRHa or cryopreservation of oocyte/
embryo ovarian tissue.
• IVF with embryo freezing prior to treatment gives the
best likelihood of a future pregnancy. However, the
limitations are the need to have a partner, and whether
the ovulation induction and delaying the cancer
treatment will adversely affect the survival.
• Technical advances in oocyte preservation of mature
eggs has reported improved pregnancy rates. It is still
less successful than embryo freezing.
• Cryopreservation and transplantation of ovarian
tissue is at research stage, although pregnancies
have been reported. This would be an option for
prepubertal girls where ovulation induction is not
possible.

• HRT is not a contraceptive.
• Owing to the risk of spontaneous pregnancy, contraception
is advised if the woman wants to avoid pregnancy.
• Barrier methods or IUCDs are the preferred options,
as there are reports of women taking COCs but still
conceiving.
• It has been suggested that COCs fail to suppress the high
FSH levels characteristic of POI.

• Consider for women with contraindications to oestrogen
and HRT.
• No clinical trials on the benefits and safety of agents such
as bisphosphonates or raloxifene.
• No evidence on safety or efficacy of herbal medicines.

What not to do
• A progestogen withdrawal test.
• Ovarian biopsy.
• No evidence on safety or efficacy of herbal medicines.

http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/CBO9781316156513.016

Fragile-X syndrome (FXS)

Background and incidence

• FXS is the most common cause of ‘inherited learning difficulty’ and the most common
known genetic cause of autism.
• X-linked dominant condition.
• Prevalence – full mutation seen in approximately 1/4000 men and 1/8000 women.
• Women carriers – about 1/154 if no family history of ‘inherited learning difficulty’,
developmental problems, or autism; and 1/128 if there is a positive family history.
• Caused by mutations of the FMR-1 (fragile-X mental retardation-1) gene on the
X-chromosome. The FMR-1 gene can be present in different allelic sizes. These
different sizes correlate with the phenotype and risk of transmission.

• Intermediate fragile-X alleles have a small risk of
expansion, estimated to be 6.6%.
• However, no intermediate allele has been reported
to expand to a full mutation (FM).
• Carriers of intermediate alleles are not at risk of
having an affected child; therefore, do not offer
prenatal diagnosis for FXS.

• Permutation (PM) – the FMR-1 gene is active.
• Some PM carriers, primarily males but also females,
are at risk of developing late-onset tremor/ataxia
syndrome or psychological symptoms.
• Females who are PM carriers may develop POI.
• When a PM allele is transmitted from a carrier
mother to her offspring, there is usually an increase
in the CGG-repeat size of the mutant allele. Thus,
pre-mutation women are at risk of having children
with FM.

• Full mutation (FM) – the gene is silenced, and is responsible for
the ‘inherited learning difficulty’.
• Because males have only one X-chromosome, a male with an FM
will always have FXS, but the manifestations vary significantly,
even within members of a single family.
• In females who carry an FM, clinical manifestations are
even more variable than in males, because they have two
X-chromosomes, one of which is inactive. The proportion of
the cells with the active X-chromosome carrying the fragile-X
mutation determines the clinical manifestations, which cannot be
predicted by routine testing.

Fragile-X tremor ataxia syndrome (FXTAS)

Premature ovarian insufficiency

• Neurodegenerative disorder occurs in male PM carriers aged > 50 years.
• Prevalence is unclear; 30% of all male carriers might develop FXTAS although
many will not present until the 8th decade of life. As the PM is thought to occur
in 1/813 men, it could affect a significant percentage of the population.
• Men with the PM do not have the intellectual impairment.
• Progressive cerebellar ataxia and intention tremor, loss of sensation in the lower
extremities, and autonomic dysfunction in the form of impotence, faecal and
urinary incontinence. Dementia risk increases with increased allele length.
• Female PM carriers have a much lower risk of FXTAS. Women affected
by FXTAS, may have additional co-morbidities, such as thyroid disease,
hypertension, peripheral neuropathy, and fibromyalgia.

• Up to 26% of women who are carriers of the PM develop POI, compared with the
general population risk of 1%.
• A woman who has POI has a 2–4% risk of being a carrier of the fragile-X PM; this risk
rises to 8–15% if there is also a family history of POI.
• There is a non-linear relationship between the nu mber of trinucleotide repeats and the
risk of POI. The highest risk occurs with repeats of 59–99. The risk plateaus or even
decreases with repeat sizes of > 100.
• Women with the FM do not have an increased risk of POI.
• PM carriers report irregular menses and shorter cycles more frequently.
• There is no validated test for assessing the risk of altered ovarian function in
asymptomatic women who carry the PM.

SECTION 3

Reproductive medicine

Full mutation – fragile-X syndrome
• Both men and women can be affected. Invariably all males, and some carrier females,
present with significant ‘learning difficulty’ and behavioural problems.
• Women with the syndrome are more mildly affected, possibly as a result of
X-chromosome inactivation. They often have a normal or borderline IQ but they are at
higher risk of depression, mood lability, and social anxiety compared with the general
population.
• Most affected men do not reproduce but it is not known whether this is due to the
severity of cognitive difficulty or as a direct effect of the syndrome, which is known to
cause macro-orchidism.

FXS and screening
• A woman with the FM can reproduce and transmit the mutation to her offspring.
• Identification of an FM or PM would allow counselling about reproductive options.
• Screening for PM in males would indicate a significant risk of being affected by a lateonset neurodegenerative disease.
• Screening for PM in women – FXTAS is less common and less debilitating in women than
in men. Identification of a PM indicates a higher risk of POI; therefore, women may try
to complete their family early while still young or by using techniques such as oocyte
storage.
• Various strategies for screening – there is no evidence as to the efficacy of the different
strategies.

Reproductive options

• Men – symptoms range from mild learning difficulties to severe intellectual disability
and autistic behaviour.
* Developmental delay – intellectual disability, speech delay.
* Behavioural features – attention-deficit disorders, autistic features.
* Medical conditions – epilepsy (20%), mitral valve prolapse, recurrent ear infections,
eye problems, e.g., strabismus.
* Physical characteristics – long face, large prominent ears, high broad forehead, large
testicles after puberty.
• Almost all affected men have a degree of learning difficulty.

Recommendations (SOGC)
• Thorough counselling and informed consent.
• Fragile-X testing (FXT) is indicated for a woman:
* With a family history of FXS, FXTAS, or POI (in > 1 family member) if the family
history indicates that she is at risk of inheriting the mutated gene.
* Who has a personal history of autism or mental retardation/developmental delay of
an unknown aetiology, or who has at least one male relative with these conditions
within a three-generation pedigree.
* Who has reproductive or fertility problems associated with an elevated level of FSH
before the age of 40 years.
• Offer prenatal fetal testing via CVS or amniocentesis to women who are confirmed to be
carriers of a PM or FM of the FMR-1 gene.
American College of Medical Genetics – screen women who present with elevated FSH
levels, a family history of POI, or have relatives with an undiagnosed learning difficulty.

Prenatal diagnosis

Pre-implantation genetic diagnosis

•
•
•
•

• Can be used to allow the selection of embryos without the mutation; however, the
molecular techniques applied do not allow distinction between PM and FM.
• Women with PM often have elevated FSH levels and may not respond well to
gonadotrophin stimulation, limiting the number of embryos available for selection.

Fetal sex testing – cell-free fetal DNA in maternal blood at 9 weeks’ gestation.
CVS or amniocentesis.
Diagnosis raises difficult ethical questions about TOP.
PM-carrier fetus:
* Does a 30% risk of FXTAS in middle age in a male fetus constitute grounds for TOP?
* Does the risk of POI or FTXAS in a female offspring constitute appropriate grounds for
consideration of TOP?
• FM-carrier female fetus – only 50% of females with FM will have a learning disability. It is a
difficult decision whether or not to terminate such potentially healthy fetuses?

CHAPTER 16 Polycystic ovarian syndrome

Prevalence and incidence
• A complex disorder, with clinical manifestation of oligomenorrhoea, hirsutism, and acne, often
complicated by chronic anovulatory infertility and hyperandrogenism.
• Prevalence – 6–7%.
• PCOS presents at a younger age, has more severe symptoms, and a higher prevalence in
women of South Asian origin.

Risks and issues
• Risks – obesity and higher prevalence of:
* Impaired glucose tolerance, type 2 diabetes.
* Sleep apnoea.
* Adverse cardiovascular risk profile with cardiometabolic syndrome (HT, dyslipidaemia,
visceral obesity, insulin resistance, and hyperinsulinaemia).
• Health issues:
* Irregular menstrual cycles – oligomenorrhea, amenorrhea.
* Hirsutism. * Acne.
* Subfertility – anovulation.
* Long-term health issues.

History
• Symptoms vary widely, with symptoms of hyperandrogenism and severe menstrual
disturbances at one end of the spectrum and mild symptoms at the other.
• Symptoms:
* Infrequent or no ovulation. * Infertility.
* Hirsutism or acne. * Alopecia.
• Family history of PCOS.

		
Diagnosis
Rotterdam Criteria – two of the three following criteria is diagnostic:
• Polycystic ovaries (≥ 12 peripheral follicles) or increased ovarian volume (> 10 cm3).
• Oligo- or anovulation.
• Clinical and/or biochemical signs of hyperandrogenism.
A raised LH/FSH ratio is no longer a diagnostic criterion for PCOS owing to its inconsistency.

Examination
• Women may have indirect evidence of insulin resistance as acanthosis nigricans – skin
is dry and rough, with grey–brown pigmentation, palpably thickened and covered by a
papillomatous elevation, giving it a velvety texture. The condition commonly affects the
axillae, perineum, or extensor surfaces of the elbows and knuckles.
• Obesity – especially central obesity.
• Hirsutism, acne, or alopecia.

79

The Androgen Excess and PCOS Society Task Force

PCOS should be defined by two criteria:
• Presence of hyperandrogenism (biochemical or clinical).
• Ovarian dysfunction (oligo- or anovulation or polycystic ovaries).

SECTION 3

Reproductive medicine

Pathophysiology
Cause of PCOS is unknown.
Multifactorial – genetic and environmental factors.

Serum LH levels are elevated in approximately 40% of women
with PCOS, ­owing to increased production (increased amplitude and frequency of LH pulses).

Decreased peripheral insulin sensitivity (insulin resistance) – compensatory hyperinsulinaemia.

Insulin acts synergistically with LH to
increase androgen production in the theca
cells of the ovary and in the adrenal gland.

Increased LH relative to FSH – ovaries preferentially synthesize androgens from ­androgen
precursors rather than oestrogens.

Women may have increased serum oestrogen levels.
Follicular development is arrested at some stage short of full
maturation of an ovulatory follicle. Therefore, although there
is no ovulation, oestrogen production continues and there is
no oestrogen deficiency. However, as a result of continued
exposure to oestrogen unopposed by progestogen, the
endometrium may become hyperplastic.

Insulin resistance becomes worse with weight gain.

Insulin inhibits the hepatic
production of SHBG.

As testosterone is bound to SHBG, more
testosterone is available in the blood in the
biologically active unbound form.

Increased androgen levels

An excessive increase in
androgen production stops
follicular development
and therefore causes
anovulation.

Insulin inhibits the hepatic production of
insulin-like growth factor 1-binding protein.

This increases the concentration of free insulinlike growth factor 1 in the circulation, which also
stimulates theca cells to produce androgen.

Leads to impaired suppression of release of free fatty acids
(FFA) from adipose tissue. There is an increased influx of FFA
from the area of central obesity into the portal circulation,
resulting in increased availability of substrate for triglyceride
production by the liver.

There is increased activity of hepatic lipase, which converts
large lipoprotein particles into smaller, more atherogenic
particles, leading to reduced concentrations of high-density
lipoprotein cholesterol and increased levels of small lowdensity lipoprotein cholesterol.

http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/CBO9781316156513.017

Investigations

• Total testosterone – normal to moderately elevated.
• SHBG – normal to low, provides a surrogate measurement of the degree of hyperinsulinaemia.
• Free androgen index (total testosterone/SHBG × 100) – normal or elevated, provides an assessment of physiologically
active testosterone. The most sensitive method of assessing hyperandrogenaemia.
• LH, FSH – not needed for the diagnosis of PCOS but essential to rule out other causes of oligomenorrhoea and
amenorrhoea. LH/FSH ratios are not useful in diagnosing PCOS because of their inconsistency. LH level may be
moderately elevated.
• Prolactin – may be mildly elevated.
• TSH – to rule out thyroid dysfunction.
• Do not measure oestradiol as levels can be normal or low in both PCOS and hypothalamic amenorrhoea.
• USS – to look for the classic picture of polycystic ovaries (PCO – 12 or more follicles in at least one ovary, measuring
2–9 mm in diameter) or increased ovarian volume (> 10 mL). Finding of PCO alone does not establish the diagnosis.

Metabolic consequences of PCOS

Cardiovascular risk

Obstructive sleep apnoea

• Insulin resistance – later development of
impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and type 2
DM.
• Type 2 DM is increased, even in women with
PCOS who are not obese (BMI < 27), suggesting
that PCOS is an independent risk factor for
type 2 DM.
• Women with PCOS are at increased risk of
type 2 DM (up to 80%) if:
* Obese (BMI > 30). * > 40 years of age.
* Have a strong family history of type 2 DM.

• Higher cardiovascular risk. These women have
increased cardiovascular risk factors such as
obesity, hyperandrogenism, hyperlipidaemia, and
hyperinsulinaemia.
• Abnormal lipid profiles – raised triglycerides, total and
low-density lipoprotein cholesterol.
• Evidence on hypertension is less consistent.
• Increased risk of developing accelerated atherosclerosis
resulting in myocardial infarction.
• Morbidity and mortality from coronary heart disease has
not been shown to be as high as predicted.

• There is a significant difference in prevalence of sleep
apnoea between PCOS and controls, even after controlled
for BMI.
• Strongest predictors for sleep apnoea are fasting plasma
insulin levels and glucose-to-insulin ratio.
• Manage:
* Ask about snoring and daytime fatigue/somnolence.
* Inform of the possible risk of sleep apnoea.
* Offer investigation and treatment when necessary.

• Screen women with FBG annually.
• If the FBG is ≥ 5.6 mmol/L, BMI is > 30, or
a strong family history of diabetes – perform
oral GTT.

• Conventional cardiovascular risk calculators have not
been validated in women with PCOS.
• Identify any cardiovascular risk factors and treat them.
• Treat hypertension.
• Do not routinely prescribe lipid-lowering treatment.

In pregnancy

Risks of cancer

• There is a higher risk of GDM. Risk is greater in obese
women with PCOS who require ovulation induction to
conceive.
• Significantly higher risk of pregnancy complications
compared to controls.

• Oligo- or amenorrhoea may predispose to endometrial
hyperplasia and later carcinoma.
• There does not appear to be an association with breast or
ovarian cancer, and no additional surveillance is required.

• Screen for GDM before 20 weeks of gestation. Refer to
a specialist obstetric diabetic service if abnormalities are
detected.
• Metformin taken throughout pregnancy has been
suggested to reduce the risk of miscarriage and GDM.
Metformin is currently not licensed for use in pregnancy
in the UK and is not recommended at present until further
evidence of safety and efficacy is available.

• Treat with progestogens to induce a withdrawal bleed at least every 3–4 months.
• Women who are oligomenorrhoeic – induce a withdrawal bleed, and then USS to assess
endometrial thickness (ET).
* If the endometrium fails to shed, ET > 10 mm, or the endometrium has an unusual
appearance – biopsy the endometrium to exclude endometrial hyperplasia or cancer.
* If the ET is normal, treat to prevent endometrial hyperplasia. Options include COCs,
cyclical progestogen for 14 days every 1–3 months and LNG-IUS.
• If the woman is unwilling to take cyclical hormone treatment or use the LNG-IUS – offer
regular USS (every 6–12 months) to assess ET and morphology.

Management

Lifestyle

Medical management

Surgical management

Diet and exercise:

Insulin-sensitizing agents:

• Loss of weight results in spontaneous resumption
of ovulation, improvement in fertility, increased
SHBG, and reduced basal level of insulin
accompanied by a normalization in glucose
metabolism.
• Lifestyle alteration reduces the likelihood of
developing type 2 DM later in life by 58%.
• Advise regular exercise (30 minutes of sweatinducing exercise daily) and a healthy, balanced
diet of regular, hypocalorific meals.
• Consider referral to a dietitian.

• Metformin and the thiazolidinediones (troglitazone, rosiglitazone, and
pioglitazone) reduce insulin resistance and reduce risk of developing
diabetes and other metabolic sequelae.
• There is no robust evidence to support the use of these drugs for the
prevention of cardiovascular disease in PCOS. Metformin is not superior
to lifestyle intervention in improving cardiometabolic risk and progression
to type 2 DM.
• Currently no evidence of a long-term benefit for their use.
• Not licensed in the UK for use in women who are not diabetic.
Weight-reduction drugs:

• May be helpful in reducing insulin resistance through weight loss.
• Orlistat and sibutramine significantly reduce body weight and
hyperandrogenism in women with PCOS.
• There are currently limited data on the use of rimonabant in women with
PCOS but it may have benefit in weight reduction and improvement in the
cardiometabolic profile.

• Bariatric surgery may be indicated in selected
women with morbid obesity.
Ovarian diathermy:

• A long-term cohort study after laparoscopic
ovarian diathermy reported persistence of
ovulation and normalization of serum androgens
and SHBG in over 60% of subjects, particularly
if they have a normal BMI. However, no
prospective studies have been powered to look at
cardiovascular risk profiles.
• Reserve ovarian diathermy for selected
anovulatory women with a normal BMI or
where a laparoscopy is required for other
indications.

Management of anovulation – ovulation induction

First-line – lifestyle and weight loss.
Aromatase inhibitors.
Dexamethasone.
Second-line – medical management: clomifene citrate, metformin, or combination of both.

Third-line – gonadotrophins or laparoscopic ovarian drilling, CC+metformin.

Fourth-line – assisted reproduction.

SECTION 3

Reproductive medicine

Management of anovulation – lifestyle and weight loss – first-line
• Obese women with PCOS are more likely than thin women with PCOS to suffer from
anovulation and less likely to respond to pharmacological OI methods.
• Women with a BMI of ≥ 30 – advise to lose weight as it may restore ovulation, improve their
response to ovulation induction agents, and have a positive impact on pregnancy outcomes.
Weight loss of even 5–10% of body weight often restores ovulatory cycles.

Medical management – second-line – clomiphene citrate
• 60–85% ovulate but only about half conceive.
• Monitor cycle in at least the first cycle and when the treatment dose needs to be increased to
minimize the risk of multiple pregnancy.
• Approximately 50% of conceptions will occur on 50 mg; with another 20–25% and 10% on
100 mg and 150 mg, respectively.
• Most pregnancies occur within first six ovulatory cycles; although a constant monthly
pregnancy rate is noted, do not continue treatment for longer than 6 months.
• Lack of conception despite evidence of ovulation may be due to anti-oestrogenic effects of CC
on the endometrium, which may manifest as a thin endometrium on TVS.
• Risk of over-response and OHSS.
• CC has been proven effective in OI for women with PCOS and is the first-line medical therapy.
• Consider alternatives for OI if:
* Endometrium is persistently thin on CC therapy.
* Pregnancy does not occur within six ovulatory cycles.

Metformin

• Metformin alone increased the odds of ovulation compared with
placebo but does not result in a significantly higher CBR.
• Metformin combined with CC may increase ovulation rates and
pregnancy rates.
• Offer metformin combined with CC to CC-resistant women,
who have a BMI of > 25, because this increases ovulation and
pregnancy rates. (NICE)

Know your drug
• Mechanism – insulin-sensitizing agent, acts by inhibiting hepatic
glucose production and increasing peripheral glucose uptake.
• Dose – start with 250–500 mg daily and increase as tolerated to
the optimal daily dose of 500–750 mg three times daily.
• Side effects – nausea, bloating, cramps, and diarrhoea.
• Not currently licensed for the treatment of ovulatory disorders in
the UK.

Know your drug
• Mechanism – selective oestrogen receptor modulator, stimulates endogenous FSH secretion
by interrupting oestrogen feedback to the hypothalamus and pituitary.
• Dose – 50 mg per day for 5 days, starting from day 2 to 5 of menses. If this produces
multiple follicular development, dose can be lowered to 25mg. If ovulation is not achieved,
dose can be increased in increments of 50 mg up to 150 mg.
• Side effects – vasomotor hot flashes, visual symptoms (visual blurring or persistent afterimages) in 1–2%, which are likely due to anti-oestrogenic effect on the visual cortex. Risk of
OHSS, multiple pregnancy (twin – 7–9% and triplet – 0.3%).
• Although more studies are required, it is best to limit a patient’s lifetime exposure to CC to
12 treatment cycles, as additional cycles may place the patient at increased risk of borderline
ovarian tumours.

Aromatase inhibitors (letrozole and anastrozole)
• Ovulation and pregnancy rates are promising, they appear to have less
of an anti-oestrogenic effect on the endometrium, and most studies
show equivalence with CC.
• Mechanism – block the conversion of testosterone and
androstenedione to oestradiol and oestrone, respectively, and inhibit
the oestrogen-negative feedback on the hypothalamic–pituitary axis.
This leads to increased gonadotrophin secretion, which results in
ovarian follicular growth.
• Advantages – shorter half-life than CC, potentially higher
implantation rates and lower multiple pregnancy rates.
• 2.4% incidence of congenital malformations and chromosomal
abnormalities in the letrozole group compared to 4.8% in the CC
group.
• However, until aromatase inhibitors have been approved for OI by the
Government, use with caution, and counsel patients carefully.(SOGC,
ACOG)

Dexamethasone and growth hormone

• Dexamethasone as adjuvant therapy to
CC has been shown to increase pregnancy
rates in CC resistant PCOS. (ACOG)
• Use of adjuvant growth hormone
treatment with GnRHa and/or hMG
during OI in women with PCOS who do
not respond to CC is not recommended
because it does not improve pregnancy
rates. (NICE)

http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/CBO9781316156513.017

Third-line management

Gonadotrophins

Laparoscopic ovarian drilling/diathermy (LOD)

GnRHa

• Human menopausal gonadotrophin (hMG),
urinary FSH, and recombinant FSH are equally
effective in achieving pregnancy.
• Pregnancy rates are 20–25% per cycle.
• Very expensive and require monitoring to
minimize the risks of excessive follicular growth.
• High risk of OHSS, multiple pregnancy, and
treatment cancellation.
• Use low-dose regimen when using
gonadotrophins in PCOS women because of
significantly lower risk of OHSS. (ACOG)

• Surgical ovarian wedge resection was thought to induce ovulation by decreasing
the ovarian theca and thus reducing androgen production. Because of the
operative morbidity of the procedure and the risk of postoperative adhesions,
ovarian wedge resection by laparotomy has been abandoned.
• LOD – uses either cautery or laser to create approximately four superficial
perforations per ovary. Less destructive to the ovary with lower risk of adhesion
formation.
• Cochrane review – there is no difference in the rates of miscarriage or LBR
between patients who undergo LOD and patients treated with gonadotropins.
There are significantly fewer multiple pregnancies in the LOD than in the
gonadotrophin treatment groups (1% vs 16%).
• Fertility benefit with LOD may be temporary and adjuvant therapy with CC or
gonadotrophins may be necessary.
• Risks – surgical risks and concerns about adhesion formation. The long-term
effects on ovarian function are unclear.
• Consider LOD in women with clomiphene-resistant PCOS, particularly when
there are other indications for laparoscopy.

• Effectiveness of pulsatile GnRH in women
with CC-resistant PCOS is uncertain; therefore,
do not use outside a research context.
• Women with PCOS who are being treated
with gonadotrophins – do not offer GnRHa
concomitantly because it does not improve
pregnancy rates, and it is associated with an
increased risk of OHSS.

IVF – fourth-line Management
• IVF/ICSI – for women who fail to conceive with gonadotropin treatment or in
the presence of other indications for ART.
• Pregnancy rates – 40–50% per cycle with IVF.
• Side effects – multiple pregnancy and a higher risk of OHSS.

CHAPTER 17 Hirsutism

Background and definition

Aetiopathology

• Hirsuitism – growth of excess hair in androgen-dependent areas usually in male pattern (face,
chest, linea alba, lower back, buttocks, and anterior thighs) in women.
• Virilization is an extreme degree of hirsutism that may include male pattern of balding, voice
deepening, muscle bulk, and clitoral enlargement.
• Hypertrichosis is excessive hair growth distributed in a generalized, non-sexual pattern. It may
be hereditary or drug-induced. It is not caused by excess androgen.
• Can have a profound effect on psychological wellbeing and quality of life.
• Prevalence of hirsuitism is 5–15% in women of reproductive age.

• Results from androgenic effect on pilosebaceous unit and is commonly associated with oily
skin and acne.
• Can occur as a result of increased androgen production or increased skin sensitivity to
androgens, or both.
• In menopausal women, a reduction in ovarian oestradiol with relatively stable levels of
testosterone production can lead to an increase in hair growth.
• In some women, increasing concentrations of LH lead to stromal hyperplasia, high
testosterone levels, and severe hirsutism.

Aetiology

• PCOS.
* Most common (72%).
* Oligomenorrhoea/amenorrhoea.
* Infertility.
* Central obesity.
* Acanthosis nigricans.

• Idiopathic hirsutism.
* No apparent underlying cause with normal serum
androgen levels (23%).
* Regular menses.
* Familial – Mediterranean and east Indian origin.
* Thought to be due to increased skin sensitivity
to androgens; or may be because of increased
α-reductase activity enhancing the local
conversion of testosterone to the more potent
dihydrotestosterone.

• Androgen-secreting tumour.
* Ovarian or adrenal tumours (0.2%).
* Androgen levels are very high.
* Sudden onset or rapid progression of hair growth,
severe hirsutism, signs of virilization.
* Pelvic or abdominal mass.

• Hyperandrogenic hirsutism.
* Due to increased production of androgens, either
from adrenals or from ovary.
* High levels of DHEA – adrenal in origin.
* High testosterone may be adrenal or ovarian in
origin.
* Irregular menses, anovulation, infertility, and risk
of endometrial hyperplasia.

• Congenital adrenal hyperplasia.
* 1–10%.
* Late-onset CAH or classical CAH.
* Elevated 17-hydroxyprogesterone.
* Women at high risk are those with a positive family history,
or Ashkenazi Jewish, Hispanic, and Slavic ethnic groups.

• Drugs.
* Anabolic steroids,
danazol, sodium
valproate.

• Cushing’s syndrome.
* Weight gain in the face (moon face), neck, upper back,
and torso; stretch marks; easy bruising and proximal
muscle weakness.
* Free cortisol levels (using a 24-hour urine collection)
or a dexamethasone suppression test.

Referral

•
•
•
•
•

Suspected androgen-secreting (ovarian or adrenal) tumour.
Clinical features suggestive of Cushing’s syndrome or CAH.
Serum total testosterone concentration is more than 5 nanomol/L.
Hair growth worsens despite treatment.
Treatment has not been effective after 6–12 months.

Ferriman–Gallwey scoring system – designed to assess the severity of hirsutism
(See ­Figure).
• Each of the nine body areas most sensitive to androgen production is assigned a score
from 0 (no hair) to 4 (heavy hair growth). The nine areas are: upper lip, chin, chest,
upper back, lower back, upper abdomen, lower abdomen, upper arms, and thighs.
• The separate scores are added to provide a total score (0–36). A score of >15 is
considered to indicate moderate to severe hirsutism.
• It is a validated tool. Although it is valuable as a clinical research tool, it has a number
of limitations, and is impractical for routine use in clinical practice.
• Assess woman’s own perception of her condition and the extent it impacts on her
quality of life, as this may guide treatment.

Investigations

Mild hirsutism

Moderate to severe hirsutism

• With no other signs of PCOS or other underlying condition. Investigations are not
usually necessary because the likelihood of identifying a medical disorder that would
change management or outcome is low. (ESCP)

•
•
•
•

Plasma testosterone.
Pelvic USS to detect an ovarian neoplasm or PCO.
DHEAS, 17-hydroxyprogesterone to rule out adrenal hyperandrogenism.
Assess for Cushing’s syndrome, thyroid dysfunction, or acromegaly, if other
features of these conditions are present.

Management
• The choice between these options depends on:
* Patient preferences.
* Extent to which the area of hirsutism that affects wellbeing is amenable to direct hair removal.
* Access to and affordability of these alternatives.
• Give a trial of at least 6 months before making changes in dose, changing medication, or adding medication. Because of the life span of hair, at least 6 months of medical
therapy is required to notice any effect.

SECTION 3

Reproductive medicine

Management

No treatment

Cosmetic methods

• If hirsutism is mild and does
not significantly impact on the
woman’s QOL.

Weight loss

• In women who are overweight:
* Weight loss decreases serum insulin
levels, ovarian androgen production,
and the conversion of androstenedione
to testosterone.
* Production of SHBG increases, further
reducing free androgen levels.

Treatment can take 6 months to show effects, therefore do
not stop early.

• Shaving does not increase the rate of hair growth or thicken hair.
However, it does leave stubble that can be unpleasant, unsightly,
sharp, and may irritate the skin.
• Waxing and plucking are effective, but can be painful and may cause
scarring, folliculitis, and hyperpigmentation. These techniques can
also lead to resistance to electrolysis.
• Bleaching can improve the appearance of dark hair in the short
term, but may also lead to skin irritation. Skin irritation is
problematic as it can lead to increased hair growth.
• Electrolysis uses a localized electric charge to destroy hair cells at
the bulb. It is effective, but is time-consuming, painful, and may
leave scars or pigmentation changes.
• Lasers – photothermolysis, a technique that generally yields better
results than electrolysis. It only affects hair in the growing phase, so
must be repeated over several months. Laser hair removal is most
effective in women with pale skin and dark hair.

Medical

Combined oral contraceptives

Know your drug - cyproterone acetate/­co‑cyprindiol
• Mechanism – it is an anti-androgen with potent progestational action.
It inhibits gonadotrophin release and binds competitively to androgen
receptors, and to a lesser degree inhibits 5α-reductase activity. It also
increases SHBG levels.
• Typical dose. Co-cyprindiol (Dianette) – ethinyloestradiol (EE) and CPA;
reverse sequential regime – CPA 100 mg D5–14 with EE 50 µg D5–24.
• Side effects:
* Elevated LFTs. Risk of feminizing the male fetus.
* Should be stopped 3–4 menstrual cycles after the woman’s hirsutism
has completely resolved, because of an increased risk of DVT.
Contraindications – because of its teratogenic potential, anti-androgen
­monotherapy is not recommended, unless adequate contraception is used.

• First-line treatment.
• COCs decrease plasma testosterone by:
* Suppression of LH secretion (thereby reducing ovarian androgen secretion).
* Increasing the production of SHBG (thereby reducing free androgen levels).
* Slight reduction in adrenal androgen secretion.
* Slight blockage in the binding of androgens to their receptor.
• COCs provide the additional benefit of contraception.
• COCs containing levonorgestrel and norethisterone are androgenic and could potentially exacerbate hirsutism.

Cyproterone acetate
• If no response despite 6 or more months of treatment with COCs, add an anti-androgen.
• Because anti-androgen has teratogenic potential, monotherapy is not recommended, unless adequate contraception
is used.
• Therefore, anti-androgens are best used in combination with OCPs. Co-cyprindiol (Dianette) – ethinyloestradiol
(EE) and CPA.
• If relapse occurs when co-cyprindiol is stopped, consider:
* Intermittent or continuous treatment with co-cyprindiol.
* Switching to a COC containing drospirenone.
• Yasmin – (EE and drospirenone) – it has anti-androgenic properties and is an alternative to co-cyprindiol for
women who require long-term treatment.

Medical management – others

Insulin-sensitizing drugs

Gonadotrophin-releasing hormone ­analogues

Facial topical eflornithine

• Metformin and the glitazones.
• Systematic review (16 RCTs) – limited efficacy.
• Not recommended.

• Induce medical oopherectomy.
• GnRH agonists can be used for women with refractory
hirsutism due to ovarian hyperandrogenism.
• Owing to the hypo-oestrogenic side effects, COCs or
oestrogen/progesterone add-back therapy is necessary.

• Benefit should be noticed in 6–8 weeks. Discontinue eflornithine
if no benefit is seen within 4 months. If improvement is seen,
continue treatment to maintain the benefits. Once the cream is
discontinued, hair growth returns to pre-treatment levels within
about 8 weeks.
• Eflornithine is contraindicated during pregnancy and
breastfeeding.
• Evidence from small RCTs suggests that eflornithine may
improve the appearance of facial hair in the short term (up to 6
months), but its efficacy in the longer term remains unclear.

Androgen receptor blockers

• Individual anti-androgens (spironolactone, finasteride, and flutamide) are each more effective than placebo, and there did
not appear to be differences among the three anti-androgens.

Know your drug – spironolactone
• Mechanism – an aldosterone antagonist; competes for the androgen
receptors in skin fibroblasts and produces limited suppression of gonadal
and adrenal androgen biosynthesis, as well as inhibition of 5α-reductase
activity.
• Typical dose – 100–200 mg daily. It can be used alone or in combination
with COCs.
• Side effects – menstrual irregularity, transient diuresis, hyperkalaemia,
postural hypotension, fatigue, headache, gastric upset, and breast tenderness.
Feminization of male fetus if pregnant while on medication.
• Contraindications – pregnancy.

Know your drug – flutamide

Know your drug – finasteride

• Mechanism – nonsteroidal anti-androgen.
• Equally effective as spiranolactone and
finesteride.
• Typical dose – 250–500 mg daily. Used alone or
in combination with COGs.
• Side effects – hepatotoxicity is rare, but liver
failure and death have been reported. Therefore,
mandates LFT monitoring.

• Mechanism – blocks 5α-reductase enzyme
responsible for conversion of testosterone to
dihydrotestosterone.
* 30–60% effect in reducing hirsutism scores.
• Side effects – very low side-effect profile.
* Teratogenic potential.

Evidence round-up
• Limited evidence from Cochrane review – some laser and photoepilation treatments may lead to short-term hair reduction.
There is less evidence of long-term benefit.
• Evidence from one RCT – COCs containing drospirenone are at least as effective as those containing CPA.
• Insulin-sensitizing drugs – systematic review (16 RCTs) has shown limited efficacy, therefore not recommended.

CHAPTER 18 Hyperprolactinaemia

Pathogenesis

Prolactinomas

Other causes of hyperprolactinaemia

•
•
•
•

• Drugs or situations that inhibit:
* Hypothalamic production of dopamine.
* Its transport to the pituitary due to the compression of the pituitary stalk.
* Its effectiveness at dopaminergic receptors.
• Craniopharyngioma and other sellar or parasellar masses, granulomatous infiltration of the
hypothalamus, head trauma, and large pituitary adenomas.
• Large nonfunctional tumour in the hypothalamus or pituitary.
• Mixed growth hormone and PRL secreting tumours – acromegaly in association with
hyperprolactinaemia.
• Chronic renal or hepatic failure – due to decreased clearance of PRL.
• PCOS is commonly associated with elevated PRL levels.
• Primary hypothyroidism – some cases have mild hyperprolactinaemia. This is a result of
increased synthesis of, or sensitivity to, hypothalamic TRH, which is able to stimulate pituitary
lactotroph cells; but the true cause is unknown.
• During pregnancy there is a progressive increase in prolactin levels (as high as 10 times
normal) because of pituitary lactotroph hyperplasia induced by the high oestrogen levels
secreted by the placenta.
• PRL levels can also rise modestly after exercise, meals, stress, chest wall/breast stimulation, or
sexual intercourse.
• Idiopathic hyperprolactinaemia.
• Drugs that reduce dopamine secretion or action – metoclopramide, phenothiazines,
butyrophenones, risperidone, serotonin reuptake inhibitors (rare), sulpiride, domperidone,
and verapamil.

•
•
•
•
•
•

Pituitary adenomas that secrete prolactin (PRL).
Invariably benign. Over 90% are small, intrasellar tumours that rarely increase in size.
Microadenomas (< 10 mm in diameter); macroadenomas (> 10 mm in diameter).
Occasionally, can be aggressive or locally invasive and cause compression of vital structures.
Malignant prolactinomas that are resistant to treatment and disseminate inside and outside the
CNS are very rare.
Prolactinomas secrete PRL, which is enhanced by oestrogen and inhibited by dopamine
(synthesized by the hypothalamus and transported to the pituitary by portal vessels).
PRL stimulates milk production and also has secondary effects on gonadal function.
PRL-secreting adenomas may also produce TSH or ACTH – uncommon.
Prolactinomas may be a component of multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome type I
(MEN I) – very rare.
Age – 2–80 years. More common in women, with a peak incidence during the
child-bearing years.
Microadenomas are present in about 10% of the normal population.

History
• Premenopausal women present with oligo-/amenorrhoea (90%), galactorrhoea (80%), and
anovulatory infertility.
• Women with amenorrhoea present with symptoms of oestrogen deficiency.
• Women with PCOS will have symptoms of PCOS.
• Postmenopausal women – usually pressure effects owing to large adenoma.
• Children – uncommon, greater proportion of macroadenomas compared to adults. Delayed
puberty in both sexes and primary amenorrhoea and galactorrhoea in girls. Because of the
increased prevalence of macroadenomas, prolactinomas in children are more frequently
accompanied by neurological symptoms.
• Evidence on the effect of hyperprolactinaemia as a risk factor for recurrent miscarriage is
insufficient and is not a part of the routine investigations. (RCOG)

Differential diagnosis
rule out secondary causes:
• Pregnancy.
• Drugs.

Risks or complications
• Hyperprolactinaemia – interrupts the pulsatile secretion of GnRH, inhibits the release of
LH and FSH, and directly impairs gonadal steroidogenesis, leading to primary or secondary
amenorrhoea.
• Chronic hyperprolactinaemia-induced hypogonadism – reduces spinal bone mineral density
(BMD). After prolactin normalization, BMD increases but does not always return to normal.
• Pressure symptoms – very large tumours result in compression of other pituitary cells or of the
hypothalamic–pituitary stalk, leading to hypopituitarism.
• Neurological manifestations are common with macroadenomas or giant adenomas, because
they are space-occupying lesions with possible compression of the optic chiasma. Neurological
symptoms include headaches, and visual impairment ranging from quadrantanopia to classical
bitemporal hemianopia or scotomas.
• Visual field defects are seen in up to 5% of cases.
• Blindness owing to an expanding prolactinoma may occur in pituitary apoplexy.

http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/CBO9781316156513.019

Prolactinoma – requires both radiographic evidence of pituitary adenoma and laboratory evidence of sustained hyperprolactinaemia, and exclusion of other causes of
hyperprolactinaemia.

Investigations
Measurement of prolactin level

• PRL values are not absolute; prolactinomas can present with variable elevation in
PRL, and there may be dissociation between tumour mass and hormonal secretion.
• Normal levels in women and men are < 500 mIU/L and 400 mIU/L, respectively
(1 μg/L = 21.2 mIU/L).
• Microadenoma – most patients have moderately elevated PRL levels of > 3000 mIU/L.
• Macroadenomas – levels of > 5000 mIU/L.
• Large nonfunctional tumours – PRL levels of < 3000 mIU/L.
• PRL values between the upper limits of normal to 2000 mIU/L – may be due to
psychoactive drugs, oestrogen, or idiopathic causes, but can also be caused by
microprolactinomas.
• A single measurement is usually adequate for diagnosis. When initial PRL values
are not diagnostic, repeat the test. To avoid the effect of pulsatile secretion, get 2–3
samples separated by at least 15–20 min.
• Repeat if PRL level is > 1000 mIU/L, and if still elevated investigate further with MRI.

Diagnostic pitfalls: macroprolactin and the ‘hook effect’
• Macroprolactin is a complex of PRL, an IgG antibody. Serum PRL concentrations are
elevated secondary to a reduced rate of clearance of this complex. Macroprolactin has
reduced bioactivity and is present in significant amounts in up to 20%, resulting in pseudohyperprolactinaemia and potential misdiagnosis.
• Rule out the presence of macroprolactin in patients with moderately elevated PRL levels
(500–3000 mIU/L) and less typical symptoms.
• The ‘hook effect’ may be observed when the serum PRL concentration is extremely high, as
in some cases of giant prolactinomas. The high amount of circulating PRL causes antibody
saturation in the immunoradiometric assay, leading to artefactually low results. Exclude the
hook effect in all new patients with large pituitary macroadenomas who have normal or mildly
elevated PRL levels.

Formal visual-field examination – for patients with
macroadenomas that abut the optic chiasm.

Pituitary imaging

• Gadolinium-enhanced MRI – extent of tumour, suprasellar extension, and compression of optic chiasma
or invasion of the cavernous sinus.
• CT with intravenous contrast enhancement is less effective than MRI in diagnosing small adenomas and
in defining the extension of large tumours, but may be used if MRI is unavailable or contraindicated.
• Normal MRI does not necessarily exclude a microadenoma.

Diagnosis
• Hyperprolactinaemia in the presence of an MRI-detected pituitary adenoma is consistent with but not unequivocally diagnostic of a
prolactinoma, because any pituitary mass that compresses the pituitary stalk may cause hyperprolactinaemia.
• Unequivocal diagnosis requires pathological analysis, but prolactinomas are rarely surgically removed.
• Empirical confirmation of the diagnosis can be obtained by medical treatment with dopamine agonists with serial assessment of serum PRL
levels and adenoma size.
• Following a course of therapy:
* Normalization of PRL plus a substantial reduction (≥ 75%) of the initial adenoma size confirms the diagnosis of a prolactinoma.
* Normalization of PRL with no change or only a small reduction in tumour volume may suggest a pituitary adenoma other than a prolactinoma.
* No change in serum PRL and no reduction in tumour volume indicate a resistant prolactinoma.
• Large tumour on the scan with only moderately elevated PRL levels (2000–3000) suggests a nonfunctioning tumour.

Reproductive medicine

Management

Surgery/radiotherapy

Expectant
• May be self-limiting in up to one third of women.
• Reassure – premenopausal women with normal menstrual
cycles and postmenopausal women with tolerable
galactorrhoea who have idiopathic hyperprolactinaemia or
microprolactinoma.
• Regular follow-up with PRL measurements to detect potential
enlarging tumours. Once women go through menopause,
prolactin levels may be normalized; therefore, in such women,
reassess the need for continuing treatment.

Medical management
• All patients with macroadenomas and most patients with
microprolactinoma require treatment.
• Indications for treatment – infertility, a pituitary tumour with
neurological effects (particularly visual defects), bothersome
galactorrhoea, long-standing hypogonadism, alterations in
pubertal development, and prevention of bone loss in women
because of hypogonadism.

Dopaminergic agonists (DA) – bromocriptine and cabergoline;
Drug-induced:

• Stop the drug or switch to an alternative drug.
• To determine if the drug is the cause, withdraw the drug
for at least 72 hours, if this is safe. Discuss it with the
prescribing physician or obtain a psychiatric evaluation
before stopping any psychiatric drugs suspected of causing
hyperprolactinaemia.

pergolide and quinagolide are less commonly used. Patients who
are resistant to, or who cannot tolerate a particular DA, switch
to an alternative DA.
• Normalize PRL levels and reduce the volume of the tumour.
• Bromocriptine is less expensive. Restores ovulation in 80–90% of
patients, and reduces the size of prolactinomas in 70% of cases.
• Cabergoline is longer acting, significantly better than
bromocriptine in terms of patient tolerability and
convenience, reduction in prolactin secretion, restoration
of gonadal function, and decrease in tumour volume. It is
effective in most patients, including those who are resistant to
bromocriptine.

Know your drug
Bromocriptine and cabergoline

• Mechanism – dopaminergic agonists.
• Dose – start at low dose to avoid intolerance and side
effects, with a gradual dose increase.
• Bromocriptine – 0.625–1.25 mg daily and increase by
1.25 mg at weekly intervals.
• Cabergoline – 0.25–0.5 mg once or twice weekly.
• Side effects:
* Bromocriptine – nausea, vomiting, headache, and
postural hypotension.
* Cabergoline – not licensed for use in early pregnancy.

Microprolactinomas

Macroprolactinomas

• Goal is to restore gonadal function and fertility. In 90–95% of cases, microadenomas do
not increase in size progressively, so suppression of tumour growth is not a treatment goal.
Microadenomas often shrink and sometimes disappear during long-term DA treatment.
• Once normal PRL levels are achieved, perform annual serial assessment of PRL.
• In some patients, DA can normalize gonadal function even if PRL levels remain above
the upper limit of normal; in these patients, follow the biological response rather than the
absolute PRL level with regard to the treatment dose.
• Because only 5–10% of microprolactinomas progress to larger tumours, women with
microprolactinoma who do not wish to become pregnant may not require therapy with
a DA.
• Those who are amenorrhoeic – treat with oestrogen and measure serum PRL annually.
• Repeat MRI if either clinical signs of tumour expansion appear or if the prolactin levels rise
significantly.

• DA – normalizes serum PRL levels and reduces tumour size.
• 80% of prolactinomas shrink by > 25% of the original volume with a 50% reduction in serum
PRL.
• Repeat MRI 2–3 months after starting therapy and at longer intervals thereafter.
• Recovery of impaired anterior pituitary function is associated with tumour shrinkage and
ovulatory menses return in over 90% of women.
• DA restores visual function similarly to that produced by surgical decompression. Therefore,
patients with macroprolactinomas who have visual field defects are no longer considered to be
neurosurgical emergencies.
• When the PRL level has been normal for at least 2 years and the size of the tumour decreased
by > 50%, decrease the dose of the DA gradually because, at this stage, low doses are likely to
maintain stable PRL levels and tumour size; however, there is a risk of tumour expansion and
hyperprolactinaemia. Therefore follow-up closely when the drug is tapered or withdrawn.
• Follow-up with regular PRL levels. If a visual defect was present at the time of diagnosis, carry
out regular visual perimetry and MRI.

Resistant prolactinoma – no adequate response to
a dopamine agonist
Treatment options

• Achieve the maximally tolerated dose.
• Change to a different dopamine agonist.
• Surgery or radiotherapy.

Radiotherapy
• External radiation – significant side effects, including hypopituitarism, damage to the
optic nerve, neurological dysfunction, and increased risks of stroke and secondary
brain tumours. Therefore, reserved for:
* Those who do not respond to DA.
* Those who are not cured by surgery.
* Very rare cases of malignant prolactinoma.

Surgical management
• Indications:
* Up to 10% of patients who do not respond to DA.
* If visual field deficits do not improve.
* Apoplexy with neurological signs in macroadenomas.
* Cystic macroprolactinomas (which generally do not shrink in response to DA) causing
neurological symptoms.
* Intolerance to DA.
* Patient preference.
* Nonfunctional tumours.
* If there is suprasellar extension of the tumour that has not regressed with medical
treatment and a pregnancy is desired.
• Trans-sphenoidal adenectomy – does not reliably lead to a long-term cure, and recurrence of
hyperprolactinaemia is frequent.
* Microadenomas – the success rate is about 75%.
* Macroprolactinomas – success rate is much lower. Recurrence in about 20%.

• Malignant prolactinomas – present as:
* Resistant prolactinomas.
* Dissociation between serum PRL levels and tumour mass.
* Recurrence after surgery.
* Extension to non-contiguous areas of the CNS.
* Metastasis to areas outside the CNS.
• Surgery and radiotherapy are only palliative, and chemotherapy seems to provide little
or no benefit. These cancers are uniformly fatal.

Follow-up
• Minimal length of DA therapy is one year. There are no signs to predict whether drug
discontinuation will be successful, but DA can be withdrawn safely in patients with
long-term normalization of prolactin levels.
• If a patient has normal PRL levels after therapy with DA for at least three years
and the tumour volume is markedly reduced, initiate a trial of tapering and
discontinuation of these drugs. Carefully follow such patients to detect recurrence
of hyperprolactinaemia and tumour enlargement so that treatment can be resumed
promptly.

SECTION 3

Reproductive medicine

Hyperprolactinaemia and fertility

Hyperprolactinaemia and pregnancy

• No treatment is necessary if regular menstrual cycles. Treat only if anovulatory cycles and
fertility is desired.
• Anovulatory women – DA restore ovulation in approximately 90% of cases, and result in a
pregnancy in 80–85%.
• Treat to correct amenorrhoea and its sequelae, rather than just for normalization of serum
levels of PRL.
• Association between hyperprolactinaemia and infertility in the presence of ovulation and
regular menstrual cycles is controversial. The incidence of raised prolactin in infertile but
ovulatory women ranges from 4–12%.
• NICE – there is no evidence to support an association between prolactin and conception rates
in ovulatory women; measure PRL levels in anovulatory women or those with symptoms of
galactorrhoea or a pituitary tumour.
• When a patient with a macroprolactinoma wishes to become pregnant – plan pregnancy once
serum PRL is normalized and the tumour volume significantly reduced to avoid or reduce
the risk of compression of the optic chiasm during pregnancy.
• Surgery before pregnancy in women with macroprolactinomas to reduce the likelihood of
major tumour expansion is a less preferable option, as medical therapy during pregnancy is
probably less harmful than surgery.
• Trans-sphenoidal surgery is an option in an infertile patient with a prolactinoma who cannot
tolerate/is resistant to dopaminergic drugs.

• Serum PRL in pregnancy does not reliably reflect an increase in the size of prolactinomas.
• Microprolactinomas – the risk of clinically relevant tumour expansion is < 2% during
pregnancy. Therefore, stop DA as soon as pregnancy is confirmed. Advise patient to report
for urgent assessment in the event of a severe headache or visual disturbance. Serial PRL
monitoring is not necessary.
• Macroadenomas – symptomatic tumour expansion occurs in 20–30% of women. Options
include stopping the DA when pregnancy is confirmed, with close surveillance, or continuing
the DA through the pregnancy.
• If visual field defects or progressive headaches develop, perform an MRI without gadolinium
and restart a DA if the tumour has grown significantly. Monitor visual fields every 2–3
months.
• If the enlarged tumour does not respond to DA therapy, alternatives include delivery if the
pregnancy is far enough advanced or trans-sphenoidal surgery.

Safety of dopamine agonists in pregnancy and lactation
•
•
•
•

Bromocriptine – incidence of miscarriage or congenital malformations is no higher than that in the general population.
Cabergoline – similar reports; however, data are limited.
Pergolide and quinagolide – limited experience; do not use these two drugs in this setting.
Bromocriptine and cabergoline – best to limit the exposure of the embryo to such drugs as much as possible.
Teratogenicity most often occurs during the first trimester and the first trimester is associated with the period of
lowest growth of a macroadenoma in pregnant women who have stopped therapy. Therefore, stop bromocriptine or
cabergoline once a pregnancy test is positive.
• Lactation – do not prescribe DA in women wishing to breastfeed because the resulting decrease in serum PRL levels will
impair lactation. There are no data to suggest that breastfeeding leads to an increase in tumour size.

CHAPTER 19 Precocious puberty (PP)

Definition and prevalence

• Defined as puberty occurring in those younger than
2 standard deviations before the average age.
• Normal age of pubertal onset is 8–13 years in girls.
The traditional threshold for PP is 8 years.
• Recent cross-sectional data (USA) – pubertal
milestones are reached earlier by black girls and
to a lesser extent by Mexican–American and white
girls; therefore, suggested PP when it occurs before
the ages of 6 years in black girls and 7 years in all
other girls.
• Current UK/European guidelines remain as 8 years.

Risks or complications

• Prevalence – girls: 0.2%, boys: < 0.05%.
• Factors affecting onset of puberty – earlier in girls with:
* Black race.
* Early maternal menarche.
* Low birth weight.
* Excessive weight gain or obesity in infancy and childhood.
* Improved socioeconomic status and nutrition, after
international adoption (the risk is 10–20 times higher).
* Exposure to oestrogenic endocrine-disrupting chemicals.
* Child abuse, particularly sexual abuse.

• Early menarche – difficult to predict the age at which
menarche will occur after the onset of puberty.
• Short adult stature owing to early epiphyseal fusion leads
to loss of about 12 cm compared to normal adult height.
Height loss is inversely correlated with the age at the
onset of puberty.
• Adverse psychosocial outcomes – disruptive behaviour,
difficulties in interpersonal relationships, and an earlier
onset of sexual behaviour.

Classification

Progressive central precocious puberty

Non-progressive precocious puberty

•
•
•
•
•
•

•
•
•
•
•
•

Characterized by a sustained activation of the gonadotropic axis.
Progression of pubertal stages from one stage to the next in 3–6 months.
Growth velocity is accelerated (> about 6 cm/year).
Bone age – usually advanced by at least 1 year.
Predicted adult height – below target height range or declining.
Uterine volume > 2.0 ml or length > 34 mm, pear-shaped uterus, endometrial
thickening.
• Usually measurable oestradiol level with advancing pubertal development.
• LH peak after GnRH or GnRHa in the pubertal range.

Gonadotropic axis is not activated.
Stabilization or regression of pubertal signs.
Growth velocity – usually normal for age.
Bone age – usually within 1 year of chronological age.
Predicted adult height – within target height range.
Uterine volume of ≤ 2.0 ml or length of ≤ 34 mm; prepubertal tubular-shaped
uterus.
• Oestradiol not detectable or close to the detection limit.
• LH peak after GnRH or GnRH agonist in the prepubertal range.

In at least 50% of cases of PP, pubertal manifestations will regress or stop progressing and no treatment is necessary.
The mechanism underlying these cases of non-progressive PP is unknown.
When these features are inconsistent, wait a few months and reassess in order to avoid unnecessary treatment.

SECTION 3

Reproductive medicine

Precocious puberty

Central or gonadotrophin-dependent

Peripheral or gonadotrophin-independent precocious puberty (GIPP)

• Premature activation of the hypothalamopituitary–
gonadal axis – serum gonadotrophins are elevated
with same pattern of endocrine change as in
normal puberty (consonant).
• Breast with or without pubic hair development.
• Increased growth velocity, possible acne, oily skin
and hair, and emotional changes.
• Variable serum oestradiol.
• Peak LH level after GnRHa stimulation – in
pubertal range.
• Advanced bone age. • Developed uterus on USS.

Benign variants of precocious pubertal

• Premature activation of the ovaries or adrenal glands independent of gonadotrophin
secretion. • Secretion of sex steroids is autonomous with loss of normal feedback
regulation. Sex steroid concentrations are elevated with low gonadotrophins.
• Pubertal development does not follow the pattern of normal puberty (disconsonant).
• Varied pubertal symptoms depending on nature of sex steroid produced.
• High/markedly elevated serum oestradiol in girls.
• Low peak serum LH after GnRHa stimulation.
• Advanced bone age. • Developed uterus on USS.
• May have advanced pubic and axillary hair growth prior to breast development, or
menstruation with minimal breast development.

development

• Usually isolated secondary sexual
characteristic.
• No/slightly increased growth velocity.
• Bone age within normal range.
• Low serum levels of sex steroids.
• Peak LH levels after GnRHa stimulation in
prepubertal range.
• Normal pelvic USS.

Idiopathic

CNS lesions

Early exposure to sex steroids

• 90% of girls.
• Diagnosis of exclusion. May have:
* Positive family history.
* History of adoption.
• Can be part of a developmental
syndrome (Williams–Beuren
syndrome).
• MRI – no hypothalamic abnormality.

• Hypothalamic tumour (glioma involving the hypothalamus or optic chiasm, germ-cell tumour, etc.).
* Possible headache, cognitive changes, symptoms or signs of anterior or posterior pituitary deficiency
(decreased growth velocity, polyuria, or polydipsia), fatigue, visual-field defects.
* Mass on MRI. * Evidence of intracranial hypertension.
• Hypothalamic hamartoma – focal, or tonic–clonic seizures. * Mass on floor of third ventricle on MRI.
• Injury – cranial irradiation, head injury, infection such as meningitis or encephalitis, perinatal insult.
* Relevant history, possible symptoms and signs of anterior or posterior pituitary deficiency.
* Moderate radiation doses used for the treatment of brain tumours in children are associated with PP,
whereas higher doses are associated with gonadotrophin deficiency and a delay in puberty.
• Cerebral malformations involving the hypothalamus – suprasellar arachnoid cyst, hydrocephalus, etc.

• Prolonged sex steroid exposure
in GIPP has a direct maturational
effect on the hypothalamus
and can accelerate the onset
of centrally mediated puberty,
leading to GDPP.

• Autonomous gonadal activation – McCune–Albright syndrome – classic
triad: PP, café au lait spots, and fibrous dysplasias of bone. Rapid
progression of breast development and early vaginal bleeding. Autonomous
hyperfunctioning most commonly involves the ovary, but other endocrine
involvement includes the thyroid (thyrotoxicosis), adrenals (Cushing’s
syndrome), pituitary (gigantism/acromegaly or hyperprolactinaemia), and
parathyroid glands (hyperparathyroidism). • Large ovarian cysts on USS.
• Exposure to exogenous agents:
* Sex steroids – COCs or testosterone gels.
* Oestrogenic endocrine-disrupting chemicals – oestrogenic agents in
cosmetics and food products can lead to premature thelarche.
• Severe primary hypothyroidism – signs of hypothyroidism, no increase in
growth velocity, low levels of free thyroxine, no advancement in bone age.

• Ovarian tumours:
* Granulosa-cell tumour – rapid progression
of breast development and possible
abdominal pain.
* Androgen-producing tumour – Leydig cell
tumours, and gonadoblastoma. Progressive
virilization.
* Abdominal examination – mass on USS or
CT scan; may be palpable.
• Adrenal disorders – increased androgen
production leading to virilization.
* CAH.
* Adrenal tumour – mass on USS or CT
scan; elevated DHEA or adrenal steroid
precursors.
* Cushing’s syndrome.

• Isolated precocious thelarche:
* Unilateral or bilateral breast development is frequent
before the age of 2 years. No further evaluation needed
in most cases.
• Isolated precocious pubarche:
* Pubic hair development, sometimes associated with
adult body odour, axillary hair, or mild acne.
* Normal cortisol precursors in serum
* Normal levels of 17-hydroxyprogesterone after
corticotropin stimulation.
• Isolated precocious menarche:
* Isolated vaginal bleeding without breast or pubic-hair
development.
* Evaluate clinically for a vaginal lesion (sexual abuse,
foreign body, tumour).
* Normal bone age and prepubertal uterus on USS.

http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/CBO9781316156513.020

History
• Age at onset of puberty and of menarche; SSCs and their pattern of progression. Take detailed history
to determine if the pattern of endocrine change is the same as in normal puberty.
• Any history of recent rapid growth.
• Family history – parents’ age and height at onset of puberty; age of menarche in mother.
• Symptoms suggesting possible CNS dysfunction – headache, increased head circumference, visual
impairment, or seizures.
• Social history – any history of adoption, child abuse, or sexual abuse.
• Drug history – to rule out an exogenous drug.

Evaluate if
• Precocious breast development at stage 3 or higher.
• Precocious breast development at stage 2 with additional criteria such as
increased growth velocity.
• Symptoms or signs suggestive of CNS dysfunction or of peripheral PP.

Examination
• Height – increased growth velocity; may precede the onset of pubertal manifestations.
• Stage of pubertal development (Tanner staging – See Chapter 14):
* Breast development.
* Pubic hair results from the effects of androgens, which may be produced by ovaries in central PP. Pubic
hair in the absence of breast development is suggestive of adrenal disorders, premature pubarche, or
exposure to androgens.
• Hyper-pigmented skin lesions in neurofibromatosis or McCune–Albright syndrome.
• Presence of dysmorphic features in multisystem syndromes.
• Visual fields and fundoscopy; focal motor deficits in intracranial tumours, injury.

Investigations

• Oestradiol (E2):
* Elevated levels suggest oestrogen production or exposure.
* Markedly elevated levels (> 100 pg/ml) suggest ovarian
cyst/tumour.
* Highly variable and has a low sensitivity in discriminating
early pubertal and prepubertal levels.
* Levels can be normal in progressive central PP.
• FSH – not useful, as varies little throughout pubertal
development.
• Serum testosterone – elevated levels suggest adrenal disorder.
• DHEAS – produced by adrenals; marker of androgenproducing adrenal tumours or of adrenal enzymatic defect.
• 17-hydroxy progesterone – marker of adrenal enzymatic
defects (CAH); occasionally elevated with adrenal tumours.
• Urinary steroid profile and ACTH stimulation test.
• Last four are indicated if there are signs of hyperandrogenism.

97

• Basal LH – poorly discriminates prepubertal and early
pubertal levels. Values > 0.3–0.4 IU/L suggest central
PP (high specificity and low sensitivity). However, if
levels of LH are not clearly elevated, it needs to be
confirmed with a stimulation test.
• GnRH or GnRHa stimulation – the gold standard.
Peak LH above the pubertal cutoff (5–8 IU/L) with
elevated sex steroids suggests progressive central PP;
suppressed peak LH level with elevated sex steroid
levels indicates peripheral PP.
• Peak LH:FSH ratio typically increases during puberty;
high ratio was used as a criterion for progressive
central PP; not in common use now as more sensitive
LH assays are available.

• Bone age with an X-ray of non-dominant hand/wrist. It is
generally greater than their chronological age.
• Pelvic USS – ovarian cysts/tumours; the multicystic ovary is a
classic feature of early puberty.
• Uterine changes due to oestrogen exposure such as uterine size
and shape (pear shape); endometrial echo.
• Uterine volume > 2.0 ml – 89% sensitivity and specificity.
• Brain MRI – in all cases of progressive central PP, determine
whether a hypothalamic lesion is present.
• CT scan or MRI of the adrenal glands.
• TFTs to rule out primary hypothyroidism.
• Genetic testing, e.g., neurofibromatosis type 1.

http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/CBO9781316156513.020

Management
• Aim – to prevent progression of SSC and onset of menarche; maximize the growth potential and psychosocial wellbeing.
• Monitor for progression of pubertal development and growth velocity for 6 months before a decision to treat is made.
• Treat the underlying cause, if any. Refer to paediatric endocrinologist for evaluation and treatment.

Central precocious puberty – GnRHa

• Reasons for GnRHa therapy – potential for compromise in adult
height, inability to adapt oneself to menarche, and psychosocial
difficulties.
• Provides continuous stimulation of the pituitary gonadotrophs,
leading to desensitization and decrease in the release of LH
and FSH; results in the regression or stabilization of pubertal
symptoms, as it is only the pulsatile exposure that triggers
pubertal progression.
• Most important clinical criterion for GnRHa treatment is:
* Documented progression of pubertal development, because
many patients with CPP have a slowly progressive or nonprogressive form and achieve normal adult height without
GnRHa.
* Accelerated growth velocity and skeletal maturation.
However, some patients with slowly progressive CPP and
advanced bone age reach normal adult height without
intervention.
• Document progressive pubertal development and growth
acceleration over a 3–6-month period before GnRHa therapy.
This may not be necessary if the child is at or past Tanner stage
III (breast), particularly with advanced skeletal maturation.
• Height gain varies. Girls with onset of progressive CPP before
6 years of age benefit most in terms of height from GnRHa
treatment. Individualize the decision to initiate therapy in girls
with onset after the age of 6 years.

Central lesion (mass or malformation)
• Refer for management of any brain neoplasms.
• Managing the causal lesion generally has no effect on
the course of pubertal development.
• Remove hypothalamic hamartomas surgically.
• Cyproterone – it is a peripherally acting antiandrogen that suppresses both gonadotrophin and
gonadal function. Can be used in combination with
GnRHa or alone.
• Growth hormone – treatment with GnRH agonists
can lead to a reduction in the growth rate owing to
a reduction in GH and insulin-like growth factor 1
levels. Addition of GH may lead to a better growth
velocity, although data are limited.

Peripheral precocious puberty

• Manage underlying cause.
• Use agents to inhibit steroidogenesis, so as to reduce
oestrogen formation, which is a prime driver of bone
maturation acceleration.
• Surgery for tumours of ovary or adrenals.
• CAH – hydrocortisone with/without fludrocortisone.
• Withdraw if any exogenous sex steroids.
• McCune–Albright syndrome – drugs to prevent the
synthesis or action of gonadal steroids. Options:
* Ketoconazole – an inhibitor of steroid synthesis
and suppresses both gonadal and adrenal steroid
production. It decreases testosterone levels and
achieves good growth.
* Aromatase inhibitors inhibit the production
of oestrogens, and selective oestrogen-receptor
modulators interfere with the action of oestrogens and
are effective in some cases.
* Aromatase inhibitors – inhibit functions of
testosterone that are dependent upon its conversion
to oestrogen. If aromatase inhibitors are used, antiandrogen agents may be needed to reduce testosterone
effects on pubic hair and genital development
(spironolactone and bicalutamide).

Subfertility

CHAPTER 20 Infertility – female

Background and prevalence

General advice and lifestyle

• Failure to conceive after regular unprotected sexual intercourse for 1 year in
the absence of known reproductive pathology. One in 7 couples has difficulty
conceiving.
• Primary – couples who have never conceived. Secondary – couples who have
previously conceived.
• About 80% of couples conceive within 1 year of regular unprotected sexual
intercourse (UPSI). Of those who do not conceive in the first year, about half
will do so in the second year (cumulative pregnancy rate > 90%).
• Female fertility and male fertility decline with age.
• With regular UPSI, 94% of fertile women aged 35 years, and 90% of those
aged 39 years, will conceive after 2 years of trying.
• Sexual intercourse every 2 to 3 days optimizes the chance of pregnancy.
Timed intercourse has no added benefit and can result in stress.

• Smoking:
* Women – smoking reduces fertility. Offer women referral to a smoking cessation programme. Passive
smoking is likely to affect their chance of conceiving.
* Men – there is an association between smoking and reduced semen quality.
• Alcohol:
* Women – should drink no more than 1 or 2 units of alcohol once or twice per week and avoid episodes
of binge drinking to reduce the risk of harming a fetus. * Men – 3 to 4 units per day is unlikely to
affect the semen quality; excessive alcohol intake is detrimental to semen quality.
• Body weight – women with:
* BMI > 30 are likely to take longer to conceive.
* BMI > 30 and not ovulating – losing weight will increase the chance of conception.
* BMI < 19 and who have irregular menstruation or amenorrhea – increasing body weight improves the
chance of conception.
* Group programme of exercise and diet leads to more pregnancies than weight loss advice alone.
* Men with BMI > 29 are likely to have reduced fertility.
• Tight underwear – there is an association between elevated scrotal temperature and reduced semen quality,
but it is not clear whether wearing loose-fitting underwear improves fertility.
• Occupation – some occupations involve exposure to hazards that can reduce fertility, therefore enquire
about occupation.
• Folic acid – dietary supplementation with folic acid (0.4 mg/day) before conception and up to 12 weeks’
gestation reduces the risk of having a baby with NTDs. For women who had an infant with an NTD, and
who are diabetic, or who are receiving antiepileptic medication, 5 mg/day is recommended.
• Rubella – offer rubella susceptibility screening and vaccination for women who are susceptible to rubella
and advise not to become pregnant for at least 1 month following vaccination.

Initial assessment and referral
• Investigate couples who have not conceived after 1 year of regular UPSI.
• Investigate earlier if there is a history of predisposing factors such as in:
* Women – aged ≥ 36 years, amenorrhoea, oligomenorrhoea, history of PID
or STI, abdominal or pelvic surgery, known or suspected tubal disorder or
endometriosis.
* Men – history of – undescended testes, urogenital surgery, STIs.
• Refer early to specialist centre, if there is a known reason for infertility (such
as prior treatment for cancer).
• Evaluate both partners at the same time.
• Discuss the options for attempting conception with people who are unable to
or would find it very difficult to have vaginal intercourse.

Psychological effects of fertility problems

• Stress can affect the couple’s relationship, and is likely to reduce libido and frequency of intercourse, which
can contribute to fertility problems.
• Fertility problems, investigations, and treatment can cause psychological stress. Offer counselling before,
during, and after investigation and treatment, irrespective of the outcome of these procedures.

Infertility – aetiology

Female

Both male and female factors may be
seen in ≈ 40% of couples.

Ovulatory disorders – 25% of couples.

Group I: hypothalamic pituitary failure (hypothalamic
amenorrhoea or hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism)
• 10% of ovulatory disorders.
• Anterior pituitary macro- or microadenoma may
alter prolactin secretion and lead to amenorrhoea and
anovulation.
• Hypothalamic causes: excessive exercising or being
underweight, or both; e.g., anorexia nervosa.
• Sheehan’s syndrome (panhypopituitarism following
massive postpartum haemorrhage or trauma).
• Kallmann syndrome (congenital lack of hypothalamic
production of GnRH): amenorrhoea and anosmia.
• Thyroid: hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism
may lead to menstrual disorders and ovulatory
dysfunction.
• Adrenal: Cushing’s syndrome and congenital adrenal
hyperplasia may cause anovulation.
• Chronic debilitating disease (e.g., uncontrolled
diabetes, cancer, AIDS, end-stage kidney disease,
and malabsorption) may lead to anovulation and
amenorrhoea.
• Chances of regular ovulation, conception, and
an uncomplicated pregnancy can be improved
by: increasing body weight if they have a BMI of
< 19 and/or moderating their exercise levels if they
undertake high levels of exercise.

101

Male

Unexplained

Low sperm count or quality – 30% of couples.
See Chapter 21.

Cause of infertility is not identified – 25% of couples.

Others – uterine, cervical, endometriosis – 10%.

Tubal damage – 20% of couples.

Group II: hypothalamic pituitary
dysfunction (predominantly PCOS)
• 85% of ovulatory disorders.

• PID leading to tubal damage.
• Pelvic surgery causing tubal damage or
adhesions.
• Sterilization.

Group III: ovarian failure
• 4–5% of ovulatory disorders.

• Previous cervical surgery causing scarring or shortening
of the cervix and cervical stenosis.
• Submucosal fibroids may distort the uterine cavity and
impair implantation.
• Cervical mucus defect or dysfunction.
• Endometriosis: tubal distortion and limitation of fimbrial
motility owing to pelvic adhesions.
• Drugs that can impair fertility in women – NSAIDs,
cyclo-oxygenase inhibitors, spironolactone,
chemotherapy, neuroleptic drugs, recreational drugs such
as marijuana and cocaine.
• Occupational and environmental factors that may affect
fertility – pesticides, metals (lead, cadmium), solvents.

Examination

Age.
Length of time trying to conceive.
Parity – previous pregnancies, outcome, complications, and miscarriages.
Same or different partner. New partner’s fertility history, if necessary.
Frequency of sexual intercourse and any difficulties with intercourse.
Menstrual cycle – age at menarche, frequency and regularity of menstrual cycles; IMB or PCB.
Women with regular monthly menstrual cycles are likely to be ovulating.
Symptoms and signs of ovulation (e.g., ovulatory discomfort, dysmenorrhoea).
Galactorrhoea or hirsutism.
Symptoms of PID or endometriosis, such as dyspareunia and dysmenorrhoea.
History of STIs or PID.
Systemic disease – thyroid dysfunction, diabetes, and inflammatory bowel disease.
Excessive exercise, weight loss, or psychological distress.
Cervical smear history.
Previous pelvic surgery, such as appendicitis, ovarian cyst.
Drug history.
Details of occupation for possible exposure to hazards that can reduce fertility.
Lifestyle factors (e.g., smoking, weight gain).

Do not recommend:
• Basal body temperature charts as they do not predict ovulation reliably.
• Use of ovulation predictor kits as no evidence that attempts to time sexual intercourse to
the menstrual cycle result in improved conception rates.
• Postcoital testing has no predictive value for pregnancy rates.
• Endometrial biopsy to evaluate the luteal phase as there is no evidence that medical
treatment of luteal phase defect improves pregnancy rates.

• BMI.
• Physical examination to identify problems that may contribute to infertility: hirsutism
and acne (PCOS), galactorrhoea (hyperprolactinaemia), any signs suggestive of
thyroid disorders.
• Signs of androgen excess.
• Pelvic examination: vaginal discharge, tenderness indicating endometriosis or PID,
uterine size and mobility, fibroids, ovarian cyst or any adnexal pathology.

Initial investigations
• Mid-luteal progesterone to confirm ovulation even if they have regular menstrual cycles.
* Regular menstrual cycles – blood test in the mid-luteal phase (D21 of a 28-day cycle).
* Irregular menstrual cycles – blood test later in the cycle (D28 of a 35-day cycle) and
repeat weekly thereafter until the next menstrual cycle.
• Serum gonadotrophins on D2–4.
• Thyroid function – women with possible fertility problems are no more likely than the
general population to have thyroid disease; do not routinely measure thyroid function.
Offer this only to women with symptoms of thyroid disease.
• Incidence of raised prolactin level in infertile but ovulatory women ranges from 4–12%.
Measure prolactin levels in women with ovulatory disorder, galactorrhoea, or a suspected
pituitary tumour.
• Screen for Chlamydia trachomatis.
• Serial USS for monitoring of follicular development is expensive.

Ovulatory disorders
• Serum follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH)

Low FSH and LH

Normal FSH and LH

High FSH and LH

• Group I: hypothalamic pituitary failure (hypothalamic
amenorrhoea or hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism).
• Pulsatile gonadotrophin-releasing hormone or
gonadotrophins with LH activity are effective in inducing
ovulation.

• Group II: hypothalamic pituitary
dysfunction (PCOS).
• See Chapter 16.

• Group III: ovarian failure.
• Egg donation.
• See Chapter 15.

• Women with ovulatory disorders
due to hyperprolactinaemia – treat
with dopamine agonists such as
bromocriptine.
• See Chapter 18.

http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/CBO9781316156513.021

Tubal disorders

Investigations
• SA and assessment of ovulation should be known before a test for tubal patency.
• Hysterosalpingography (HSG) - for women at low risk of co-morbidities (PID, previous
ectopic pregnancy, or endometriosis) to screen for tubal occlusion. It is a reliable test for
ruling out tubal occlusion, and is less invasive and makes more efficient use of resources
than laparoscopy.
• Laparoscopy and dye – for women at risk of co-morbidities so that tubal and other pelvic
pathology can be assessed at the same time.
• Hysterosalpingo-contrast ultrasonography (HYCOSY) – consider screening for tubal
occlusion with HYCOSY because it is an effective alternative to HSG for women who are
at low risk of co-morbidities.
• Screen for Chlamydia trachomatis:
* Screen women before any uterine instrumentation. See Chapter 44.
* Consider prophylactic antibiotics if screening has not been carried out.

Management
• Tubal catheterization or cannulation – for women with proximal tubal obstruction, selective
salpingography plus tubal catheterization or hysteroscopic tubal cannulation may be
treatment options because these treatments improve the chance of pregnancy.
• Tubal microsurgery and laparoscopic tubal surgery – for women with mild tubal disease,
tubal surgery may be more effective than no treatment.
• Surgery for hydrosalpinges before in vitro fertilization treatment:
* LBR with IVF in women with hydrosalpinges is about one half compared to women
without hydrosalpinges. Offer laparoscopic salpingectomy or proximal tubal occlusion to
women with hydrosalpinges before IVF because this improves the chance of a live birth.
* For every six women with hydrosalpinges, one more pregnancy will be achieved if
salpingectomy or tubal occlusion is performed before IVF. (ASRM)
* Insufficient data on the effectiveness of alternative treatments such as neosalpingostomy,
transvaginal aspiration of hydrosalpingeal fluid, hysteroscopic tubal occlusion, or
antibiotic therapy. (ASRM)

Unexplained infertility
• Do not offer oral ovarian stimulation agents (such as clomifene citrate, anastrozole, or
letrozole) as a standalone treatment as this does not increase the chances of a pregnancy.
• Offer IVF treatment if women do not conceive after 2 years of regular UPSI.

103

Others

Investigations
• Assessing uterine abnormalities – HSG, USS, hysteroscopy:
* Examination of uterine cavity – tailor to the needs of the individual patient. (ASRM)
* Do not offer hysteroscopy routinely as part of the initial investigation unless clinically indicated
because the effectiveness of surgical treatment of uterine abnormalities on improving CPR is
not established.
• Peritoneal factors (adhesions, endometriosis):
* USS, laparoscopy – laparoscopy if there is evidence or suspicion of endometriosis, pelvic/
adnexal adhesions, or tubal disease. (ASRM)
* Post-coital testing of cervical mucus – do not offer routine post-coital testing of cervical mucus
because it has no predictive value on CPR.
• Tests of ovarian reserve currently have limited sensitivity and specificity in predicting fertility.
However, inform women who have high levels of gonadotrophins that they are likely to have
reduced fertility.
• Evaluate ovarian reserve in selected patients to obtain prognostic information that may have a
significant influence on treatment. (ASRM)

Management
• Uterine surgery:
* Hysteroscopic adhesiolysis – for women with amenorrhoea with intrauterine adhesions. This
may restore menstruation and improve the chance of pregnancy.
• Endometriosis – See Chapter 12.
* Medical management (ovarian suppression) – medical treatment of minimal and mild
endometriosis does not enhance fertility in subfertile women.
* Surgical ablation – women with minimal or mild endometriosis who undergo laparoscopic
surgical ablation or resection of endometriosis and adhesiolysis, it improves the chance of
pregnancy.
* Ovarian endometriomas – laparoscopic cystectomy improves chance of pregnancy.
* Moderate or severe endometriosis – surgical treatment improves chance of pregnancy.
* Postoperative medical treatment does not improve pregnancy rates in women with moderate
to severe endometriosis.

Intrauterine insemination
• Do not offer IUI for:
* Mild male factor infertility.
* Unexplained infertility.
* Minimal to mild endometriosis.
• Advise them to try to conceive for a total of 2 years, then consider IVF.

SECTION 4

Subfertility

IVF – NICE

Factors affecting the outcome of IVF
• Female age – chance of a live birth following IVF declines with female age. Use a woman’s
age as an initial predictor of her overall chance of success through natural conception or
with IVF.
• Can predict the ovarian response to gonadotrophin stimulation in IVF with:
* Total antral follicle count of ≤ 4 for a low response and > 16 for a high response.
* AMH ≤ 5.4 pmol/L for a low response and ≥ 25.0 pmol/L for a high response.
* FSH > 8.9 IU/L for a low response and < 4 IU/L for a high response.
• Do not use ovarian volume, ovarian blood flow, inhibin B, or oestradiol (E2) to predict
any outcome of fertility treatment.
• Number of embryos to be transferred and multiple pregnancy – the chance of multiple
pregnancy depends on the number of embryos transferred per cycle of treatment.
To balance the chance of a live birth and the risk of multiple pregnancy and its
consequences, do not transfer more than two embryos during any one cycle.
• Number of previous treatment cycles – chance of a live birth falls as the number of
unsuccessful cycles increases.
• Pregnancy/obstetric history – IVF is more effective in women who have previously been
pregnant and/or had a live birth.
• Alcohol, smoking, and caffeine consumption:
* Consumption of > 1 unit of alcohol per day reduces the effectiveness of ART.
* Male and female smoking can adversely affect the success rates of ART.
* Caffeine consumption has adverse effects on the success rates of ART.
• Body weight – female BMI outside 19–30 is likely to reduce the success of ART.

Ovulation induction
• Using pre-treatment (with either the OCPs or a progestogen) as part of IVF does not affect
the chances of having a live birth. Consider pre-treatment to schedule IVF in women who
are not undergoing long down-regulation protocols.
• Down-regulation – regimens to avoid premature LH surges in gonadotrophin-stimulated
IVF cycles. Use either GnRH agonist down-regulation (long protocol) or GnRH
antagonists.
• Use GnRH agonists in women who have a low risk of OHSS.
• Controlled ovarian stimulation – urinary and recombinant gonadotrophins are equally
effective. Individualize the starting dose of FSH based on age, BMI, presence of PCO, and
ovarian reserve. Do not use a dosage of FSH > 450 IU/day.
• Natural cycle IVF has lower pregnancy rates than stimulated IVF (CC or gonadotrophins).
• For women who have regular ovulatory cycles, the likelihood of a live birth after
replacement of frozen–thawed embryos is similar in natural or stimulated cycles.
• Use of adjuvant growth hormone or dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) with
gonadotrophins does not improve pregnancy rates.
• Monitor the cycle with USS (with or without oestradiol levels) for efficacy and safety.
• Triggering ovulation – use hCG (urinary or recombinant) to trigger ovulation.
• Women at high risk of OHSS – do not use hCG for oocyte maturation or luteal support.

Referral, medical assessment, and screening for IVF in the UK
• Screen for HIV, hepatitis B and hepatitis C viruses; manage and counsel people found to test
positive.
• Referral – women who have not conceived after 2 years of regular UPSI or 12 cycles of artificial
insemination (where 6 or more are by IUI):
* Women aged < 40 years – offer 3 full cycles of IVF/ICSI. If woman reaches the age of 40 years
during treatment, complete the current full cycle but do not offer further full cycles.
* Women aged 40 to 42 years – offer 1 full cycle of IVF/ICSI, provided they have never
previously had IVF treatment, there is no evidence of low ovarian reserve, risks and
implications of IVF and pregnancy at this age have been discussed.

• Oocyte retrieval:
* Women undergoing transvaginal retrieval of oocytes – offer conscious sedation because it is a
safe and acceptable analgesia.
* Do not use follicle flushing in women who have developed at least three follicles because it
does not increase the numbers of oocytes retrieved or pregnancy rates, and it increases the
duration of oocyte retrieval and associated pain.
• Assisted hatching does not improve pregnancy rates.
• Embryo transfer – ultrasound-guided ET improves pregnancy rates.
* ET on D2 or D3 and D5 or D6 appear to be equally effective.
* Replacement of embryos into a uterine cavity with an endometrium of < 5 mm thickness is
unlikely to result in a pregnancy.
* Bed rest of more than 20 minutes’ duration following ET does not improve the outcome.
• Number of fresh or frozen embryos to transfer in IVF:
* For women aged < 37 years: 1st IVF cycle, use single embryo transfer (SET); 2nd IVF cycle, use
SET if 1 or more top-quality embryos are available. Consider using 2 embryos if no top-quality
embryos are available; 3rd IVF cycle, transfer no more than 2 embryos.
* For women aged 37–39 years: 1st and 2nd IVF cycles, use SET if there are one or more
top-quality embryos. Consider double embryo transfer if there are no top-quality embryos;
3rd IVF cycle, transfer no more than 2 embryos.
* For women aged 40–42 years, consider double embryo transfer.
* No more than 2 embryos should be transferred during any one cycle of IVF. Where a topquality blastocyst is available, use SET.
* Women using donor eggs – embryo transfer strategy based on the age of the donor.
* Cryopreserve to store any remaining good-quality embryos after embryo transfer.
* If ≥ 2 embryos are frozen then transfer them before the next stimulated cycle because this will
minimize ovulation induction and egg collection, both of which carry risks for the woman and
use more resources.
* Women with regular ovulatory cycles – chances of live birth after replacement of
frozen–thawed embryos is similar for natural cycles and hormone-supplemented cycles.
• Luteal support – use progesterone for luteal support.
* Do not routinely use hCG for luteal support because of the increased risk of OHSS.
* No evidence to support continuing any form of treatment for luteal phase support beyond
8 weeks’ gestation.

http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/CBO9781316156513.021

Intrauterine insemination
• Consider unstimulated IUI in those:
* Who are unable to, or find it very difficult to, have vaginal intercourse because of a clinically
diagnosed physical disability or psychosexual problem.
* Who are using partner or donor sperm.
* People with a specific condition (e.g., after sperm washing where the man is HIV positive).
* People in same-sex relationships.
• Success rate: > 50% of women aged under 40 years will conceive within 6 cycles of IUI. Of those
who do not conceive within 6 cycles of IUI, about half will do so with a further 6 cycles (cumulative
pregnancy rate over 75%).
• Fresh sperm is associated with higher conception rates than frozen–thawed sperm. However,
IUI even using frozen–thawed sperm is associated with higher conception rates than intracervical
insemination.
• Advise insemination to time around ovulation.
• If the woman does not conceive after 6 cycles, assess clinically and investigate. If partner sperm is
being used, partner also needs assessment and investigations.
• If not conceived after 6 cycles of donor or partner insemination, despite evidence of normal
ovulation, tubal patency, and semen analysis, offer a further 6 cycles of unstimulated IUI before IVF
is considered.

Intracytoplasmic sperm injection
• Indications:
* Severe deficits in semen quality.
* Obstructive azoospermia.
* Non-obstructive azoospermia.
* Previous IVF cycle – failed or very poor fertilization.
• Consider genetic issues including appropriate genetic counselling and testing.
• ICSI vs IVF – ICSI improves fertilization rates compared to IVF alone, but once fertilization is
achieved, the pregnancy rate is no better than with IVF.

Gamete intra-Fallopian transfer and zygote intra-Fallopian transfer:
• There is insufficient evidence for the use of GIFT or ZIFT in preference to IVF in couples with
unexplained fertility problems or male factor fertility problems.

Oocyte donation
• Indications:
* Premature ovarian insufficiency.
* Gonadal dysgenesis including Turner’s syndrome.
* Bilateral oophorectomy.
* Ovarian failure following chemotherapy or radiotherapy.
* Certain cases of IVF treatment failure.
* High risk of transmitting a genetic disorder to the offspring.
• Screen oocyte donors for infectious and genetic diseases.
• Offer counselling for oocyte recipients and donors regarding the physical and psychological
implications of treatment for themselves and their genetic children, including any potential children
resulting from donated oocytes.
105

Long-term safety of ARTs for women and children
• OI and ovarian stimulation:
* No direct association is seen between these treatments and invasive cancer.
* No association is seen in the short- to medium-term between these treatments and
adverse outcomes (including cancer) in children born.
* Information on long-term health outcomes in women and children is still awaited.
• IVF – while the absolute risks of long-term adverse outcomes of IVF treatment with or
without ICSI are low, a small increased risk of borderline ovarian tumours cannot be
excluded. The absolute risks of long-term adverse outcomes in children born as result of
IVF are low.
• Limit drugs used for OI or ovarian stimulation agents and controlled ovarian stimulation
in IVF treatment to the lowest effective dose and duration of use.

Virology issues
HIV positive
• If male is HIV positive – risk of HIV transmissionto the female partner is negligible
through UPSI if all the below criteria are met:
* Male is compliant with HAART.
* Male has had a plasma viral load of < 50 copies/ml for more than 6 months.
* There are no other infections present.
* UPSI is limited to the time of ovulation.
• If all the above criteria are met, sperm washing may not reduce the risk of infection
further and may reduce the likelihood of pregnancy.
• If couples who meet the above criteria still perceive an unacceptable risk of HIV
transmission, consider sperm washing.
• There is insufficient evidence to recommend that HIV negative women use pre-exposure
prophylaxis, when all the above criteria are met.
• If male is HIV positive and either he is not compliant with HAART or his plasma viral
load is ≥ 50 copies/ml, offer sperm washing.
• Sperm washing reduces, but does not eliminate, the risk of HIV transmission.
Hepatitis B positive
• Offer and vaccinate partners with hepatitis B before starting fertility treatment.
• Do not offer sperm washing as part of fertility treatment.
Hepatitis C – where the man has hepatitis C:
• The risk of transmission through UPSI is low.
• MDT care – the couple, a fertility specialist, and a hepatitis specialist. Men can consider
treatment options to eradicate the hepatitis C with their appropriate specialist before
conception is considered.

CHAPTER 21 Infertility – male
Male factor is responsible in about 30% of infertile couples and contributory in another 30–40%.

Investigate if pregnancy fails to occur within one year of regular unprotected intercourse.
Evaluate before one year if male infertility risk factors are present.

Initial screening evaluation

Semen analysis

History
• Duration of infertility and prior fertility.
• Sexual history – coital frequency and timing.
• Childhood illnesses and developmental history such as viral
orchitis or cryptorchidism.
• Infections such as epididymitis or urethritis, including STIs.
• Genital trauma or prior pelvic or inguinal surgery.
• Gonadal toxin exposure such as prior radiation therapy/
chemotherapy, recent fever, or heat exposure.
• Family history of birth defects, mental disability, reproductive
failure, or cystic fibrosis.
• Medical and surgical history.
• Drug history, over-the-counter and recreational drugs.
• Agents such as heat, X-rays, metals, and pesticides – evidence
suggestive of a harmful effect. Therefore, enquire about
occupation; e.g., radiotherapists, engine drivers, diggers,
agricultural workers, chemists, laboratory workers, painters.

• If the first semen analysis (SA) is abnormal,
repeat it in 3 months after the initial analysis
to allow time for the cycle of spermatozoa
formation to be completed (not mandatory and
can be done earlier if it generates anxiety).
• A single-sample analysis will falsely identify
about 10% of men as abnormal, but repeating
the test reduces this to 2%.
• If azoospermia or severe oligozoospermia is
detected, repeat the test as soon as possible
(within 2–4 weeks).

Full evaluation – examination and investigations
• If the sperm concentration is ≤ 5 × 106/ml, impaired sexual function or
other clinical findings suggestive of any specific concern from history.
• Azoospermia – complete absence of sperm from the ejaculate (1% of all
men and in approximately in 15% of infertile men).

Examination
• Secondary sexual characteristics – body habitus, hair distribution, and gynaecomastia.
• Examination of the penis; location of the urethral meatus; testis size (normal volume > 19 ml),
mass, and consistency; presence of a varicocele; presence and consistency of vasa and epididymides.

107

General advice
• Alcohol consumption of 3–4 units per day is unlikely to affect fertility.
Excessive alcohol intake is detrimental to semen quality.
• There is an association between smoking and reduced semen quality
(although the impact of this on male fertility is uncertain), and stopping
smoking will improve general health.
• BMI of > 29 – likely to have reduced fertility.
• There is an association between elevated scrotal temperature and
reduced semen quality, but it is uncertain whether wearing loose-fitting
underwear improves fertility.

Perform serum prolactin levels and pituitary CT or MRI.

• Bilateral testicular atrophy, low semen volume.
• Chromosomal abnormalities found in 7% of male infertility. Sex chromosome aneuploidy is
most common (Klinefelter syndrome in 2/3 cases). Karyotype all patients with non-obstructive
azoospermia and severe oligospermia (sperm count: < 5 × 106/ml).
• Y-chromosome microdeletions – may be found in 10–15% of men with azoospermia or severe
oligozoospermia. Prognostic significance – with deletions in AZFa or AZFb regions, sperm are
normally not found, whereas up to 80% with AZFc deletions may have retrievable sperm. (AUA)
• Counsel regarding inheritance of the compromised fertility potential in male offspring.

Obstructive

Vasal agenesis

Erectile/ejaculatory

Obstruction

• Anejaculation.
• Retrograde ejaculation – perform
a post-ejaculatory urinalysis.
• Erectile dysfunction.

Congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens

Epididymal/vasal obstruction

• 70% of men with CBAVD and no clinical evidence of cystic fibrosis have an abnormality of CFTR gene.
(Almost all males with clinical cystic fibrosis have CBAVD).
• Seminal vesicle hypoplasia or agenesis – owing to embryological association between the vasa and seminal
vesicles.
• Low semen volume – since majority of semen is derived from seminal vesicles.
• Both partners – genetic counselling and test for CFTR gene. Failure to identify a CFTR abnormality in a
man with CBAVD does not rule out the presence of a mutation, as many mutations may not be detected by
routine testing methods; therefore, test the spouse for CFTR gene abnormalities because she may be a carrier.
• In patients who have CBAVD and CFTR mutations, the prevalence of renal anomalies is extremely rare.
Therefore, imaging of the kidneys with USS or CT scan is only indicated in men with CBAVD with no
mutations in CFTR.

• Vasa and testes are normal, semen volume normal.
* Bilateral epididymal obstruction – identified only by surgical
exploration.
* Vasal obstruction – vasectomy (most common), severe genitourinary
infections, iatrogenic.
• Vasography – to diagnose whether the obstruction is in vas deferens or
ejaculatory ducts. It should not be done unless reconstructive surgery is
undertaken at the same surgical procedure.

Unilateral vasal agenesis

• Transrectal USS (TRUS) – to evaluate the ampullary portion of the contralateral vas deferens and the
seminal vesicles, because unilateral vasal agenesis can be associated with contralateral atresia of the vas
deferens or seminal vesicle, leading to obstruction azoospermia.
• There is a strong association between unilateral vasal agenesis and ipsilateral renal anomalies; therefore,
organize USS or CT scan of the kidneys.

Ejaculatory duct obstruction

• Semen volume low (< 1.0 ml).
• Seminal pH low and fructose low, as the seminal vesicle secretions are
alkaline and contain fructose.
• TRUS – minimally invasive and avoids the risk of vasal injury associated
with vasography.
• With or without seminal vesicle aspiration and seminal vesiculography –
determine the anatomical site of the obstruction.
• Vasography.

Treatment

Pre-testicular

Gonadotrophins

Testicular

Post-testicular

• Surgical sperm retrieval (SSR)
by TESA/TESE and ICSI.
• Donor sperm (DI).

Ejaculatory/erectile

Obstructive

Microsurgical reconstruction

SSR and ICSI

• Vasovasostomy – is preferable to SSR/ICSI in men with prior vasectomy if the
obstructive interval is < 15 years and no female fertility risk factors are present.
Sperm return in 70–95% of cases, and pregnancies in 30–75% of couples.
• Vasoepididymostomy – for congenital, infectious, or idiopathic epididymal
obstruction; 20–40% of couples achieve pregnancy.
• Transurethral resection of the ejaculatory ducts – sperm in 50–75% of cases
and pregnancy rate is about 25%.

• ICSI – requires intervention in both male and female.
• Microsurgical reconstruction vs SSR/ICSI.
* Microsurgical more cost-effective; if successful, allows couples to have
subsequent children without additional medical treatment.
* SSR/ICSI is preferred to surgical treatment when (1) female factors
requiring IVF, (2) chance for success with SSR/ICSI exceeds the chance for
success with surgical treatment, or (3) SSR/ICSI is preferred by the couple.

Erectile dysfunction

Anejaculation

Retrograde ejaculation

• Identify and treat any organic co-morbidities and psychosexual dysfunctions.
• Treatment options:
* Oral phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors.
* Intraurethral alprostadil.
* Intracavernous vasoactive drug injection.
* Vacuum constriction devices.
• Apply these in a step-wise fashion with increasing invasiveness and risk
balanced against the likelihood of efficacy.

• Serotonin reuptake inhibitors.
• SSR/ICSI.

• Alkalanization of urine, sperm retrieval, and ICSI.

• SSR before ICSI may be performed using several different techniques depending on the
pathology and wishes of the patient.
• In all cases, facilities for cryopreservation of spermatozoa should be available. (NICE)

Donor insemination

Indications

DI treatment

•
•
•
•
•
•

Counsel regarding physical and psychological implications of treatment.
• Assessment of the female partner:
* Confirm woman is ovulating.
* If history is suggestive of tubal damage, offer tubal assessment.
* Women with no risk factors in their history should be offered tubal
assessment after three cycles if treatment has been unsuccessful.

Obstructive azoospermia.
Non-obstructive azoospermia.
Infectious disease in the male partner (such as HIV).
Severe rhesus isoimmunization.
Severe deficits in semen quality in couples who do not wish to undergo ICSI.
Certain cases where there is a high risk of transmitting a genetic disorder to the offspring.

SECTION 4

Subfertility

• IUI vs intracervical insemination – couples using donor sperm should be offered IUI in preference to intracervical insemination
because it improves pregnancy rates.
• Unstimulated vs stimulated DI – women who are ovulating regularly should be offered a minimum of six cycles of DI without ovarian
stimulation to reduce the risk of multiple pregnancy and its consequences.
• Timing of DI – timing of insemination using either urinary LH or basal body temperature changes is equally effective in donor cycles.
However, using urinary LH detection reduces the number of clinic visits per cycle.
• Maximum number of cycles – couples should be offered other treatment options after six unsuccessful cycles of DI.

What not to do
•
•
•
•
•
•

Screening for antisperm antibodies.
Routine use of post-coital testing of cervical mucus.
Routine use of sperm DNA integrity testing. (AUA).
Routine test of reactive oxygen species (ROS).
Complementary therapies.
Use of anti-oestrogens, gonadotrophins, androgens, bromocriptine, or
kinin-enhancing drugs in men with idiopathic semen abnormalities.
• Use of antibiotics for men with leucocytes in their semen unless there is
an identified infection.
• Surgery for men for varicocoele.

• If the first semen analysis is abnormal, repeat test in 1 month after the initial analysis.
• Examination and investigations if the sperm concentration is < 10 × 106/ml.
• Tests for anti-sperm antibodies (ASA):
* Pregnancy rates may be reduced by ASA in the semen. Risk factors for ASA
include ductal obstruction, prior genital infection, testicular trauma, and prior
vasovasostomy or vasoepididymostomy.
* Consider ASA test when there is isolated asthenospermia with normal sperm
concentration, sperm agglutination, or an abnormal post-coital test.
* Some recommend ASA test for couples with unexplained infertility.
* ASA test is not needed if sperm are to be used for ICSI.
• Sperm viability tests – determine whether non-motile sperm are viable by identifying
which sperm have intact cell membranes. Non-motile but viable sperm, as determined
by the HOS test, may be used successfully for ICSI.
• Quantitation of leucocytes in semen – true pyospermia leukocytes: 1 × 106/ml) should
be evaluated for a genital tract infection or inflammation. (AUA)

CHAPTER 22 Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome

Background and incidence
• A systemic disease resulting from vasoactive products released by hyperstimulated ovaries.
• Increased capillary permeability leads to leakage of fluid from the vascular compartment,
with third-space fluid accumulation and intravascular dehydration.
• It can occur after any form of supra-physiological ovarian stimulation, including clomifene
citrate (CC), gonadotrophin ovulation induction, and IVF.
• Incidence – variable incidence reported owing to the variety of classification schemes used.
* Mild OHSS – up to 33% of IVF cycles.
* Moderate or severe OHSS 3–8%.

•
•
•
•

History

Ovarian stimulation.
Abdominal distension, abdominal pain.
Nausea and vomiting.
Breathlessness.

Examination

• Body weight and abdominal girth.
• Abdominal examination – degree of distension, palpable
ovaries, presence or absence of ascites, any tenderness.
• Heart rate, blood pressure, chest examination.
• Hydration – intake and output.

Risk factors – women at higher risk of OHSS
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Women with polycystic ovaries.
Women < 30 years of age.
Use of GnRH agonists.
Exposure to LH/hCG.
Development of multiple follicles.
Previous episodes of OHSS.
Cycles where pregnancy occurs, particularly multiple pregnancies.

Risks or complications
• Morbidity – thrombosis, renal and liver dysfunction, acute respiratory distress syndrome,
prolonged hospitalization.
• Mortality – very rare.
• Although reduced renal perfusion secondary to hypovolaemia or tense ascites may lead to
oliguria in about one third of women with severe OHSS, acute renal failure is rare.

HFEA (UK) standards
• Provide all women undergoing ovarian stimulation clear advice about the symptoms and
risks of OHSS.
• Assisted Conception centers should have agreed protocols for referral of women with
suspected OHSS to hospital care, and written protocols for initial OHSS management.

Differential diagnosis

• Complication of an ovarian cyst (torsion, haemorrhage).
Suspect torsion in the presence of worsening, particularly of
unilateral pain and nausea. Colour Doppler assessment of
ovarian blood flow may help in diagnosis.
• Pelvic infection.
• Intra-abdominal haemorrhage.
• Ectopic pregnancy.
• Appendicitis.

SECTION 4

Subfertility

‘Early’ and ‘late’ OHSS –
Investigations
•
•
•
•
•
•

Full blood count: haemoglobin, haematocrit, white cell count to assess haemoconcentration.
CRP, urea and electrolytes, LFTs.
Serum β-hCG.
Baseline clotting studies.
Pelvic ultrasound for ascites and ovarian size.
Chest X-ray and ultrasonography if respiratory symptoms.

may be useful in determining the prognosis.

• Early – OHSS presenting within 9 days after the ovulatory dose of hCG; is likely to reflect
excessive ovarian response and the precipitating effect of exogenous hCG administered for
final follicular maturation.
• Late – OHSS presenting after this period reflects endogenous hCG stimulation from an
early pregnancy. Late OHSS is more likely to be severe and to last longer than early OHSS.

Grading – to aid management
The severity could worsen over time as the condition evolves.

Mild

Moderate

• Abdominal bloating.
• Mild abdominal pain.
• Ovarian size usually < 8 cm.

•
•
•
•

Moderate abdominal pain.
Nausea ± vomiting.
Ultrasound evidence of ascites.
Ovarian size usually 8–12 cm.

Severe

•
•
•
•

Critical

Clinical ascites (occasionally hydrothorax). • Oliguria.
Haemoconcentration; haematocrit > 45%.
Hypoproteinaemia.
Ovarian size usually >12 cm.

•
•
•
•
•
•

Tense ascites or large hydrothorax.
Haematocrit > 55%.
White cell count > 25,000/ml.
Oligo-/anuria.
Thromboembolism.
Acute respiratory distress syndrome.

Management
Essentially supportive care until the condition resolves spontaneously.

Outpatient

• Mild OHSS and majority of moderate OHSS.
• Analgesia – paracetamol or codeine.
• Encourage to drink to thirst, rather than to excess. It is the most
physiological approach to replace volume avoiding the risk
of hypervolaemia and worsening ascites that may occur with
vigorous intravenous therapy.
• Continue progesterone luteal support.
• Review every 2–3 days.
• Urgent review if increasing severity of pain, increasing abdominal
distension, shortness of breath, and a subjective impression of
reduced urine output as signs of worsening OHSS.

Inpatient

• Severe OHSS.
• Moderate OHSS if unable to achieve control
of pain and/or nausea with oral treatment.
• Where there are difficulties in ensuring
adequate ongoing monitoring.
• Assess at least daily.

Intensive care

• Critical OHSS.
• Specific complications – ARDS, renal failure, and
thromboembolism.
• Severe OHSS where initial crystalloid and
colloid therapy fails to correct dehydration and
haemoconcentration.
• Needs more frequent than daily assessment.

http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/CBO9781316156513.023

Inpatient care

Assessment
• History – pain, breathlessness.
• Examination – degree of distension of abdomen, palpable ovaries, presence
of ascites and paralytic ileus.
• Abdominal girth and weight – admission and daily until resolution.
• Cardiovascular – heart rate, blood pressure.
• Hydration – monitor intake and output chart at least on daily basis,
with more frequent assessment if the woman is dehydrated or receiving
intravenous fluids. Urine output of <1000 ml/day or a persistent positive
fluid balance is a cause for concern.

• Experienced clinicians.
• MDT care – anaesthetic, medical colleagues, specialists
with expertise in intensive care.

Investigations
• FBC – haemoconcentration is a measure of the severity of OHSS and may be measured by raised
haemoglobin and haematocrit.
• White cell count – an increase may indicate an ongoing systemic stress response.
• Urea and electrolytes – hyponatraemia, may be dilutional as a result of antidiurectic hormone
hypersecretion.
• LFTs may be abnormal in 25–40% of severe OHSS cases and usually normalize with resolution of the
disease.
• Baseline clotting studies.
• Pelvic ultrasound for ascites and ovarian size.
• Chest X-ray if respiratory symptoms and signs are suggestive of hydrothorax, pulmonary infection, or
pulmonary embolism.
• Chest ultrasonography can assist diagnosis of hydrothorax.
• ECG and echocardiogram if suspected pericardial effusion or pulmonary embolism.

Inpatient management

Symptomatic relief

• Antiemetics if necessary. Nausea is usually related to the accumulation of
ascites, so measures to reduce abdominal distension should provide relief.
• Analgesia – paracetamol, opiates.
• Do not use NSAIDs because they may compromise renal function in
patients with OHSS.

113

Fluid management

• Drink to thirst, rather than to excess.
• Where oral intake cannot be maintained, IV crystalloids, such as normal saline
2–3 L in 24 hours, guided by a strict fluid balance chart.
• Colloids – women with persistent haemoconcentration and/or UOP < 0.5 ml/kg/hour
may benefit from colloids; e.g., human albumin, 6% hydroxyethyl starch (HES),
dextran, mannitol, and Haemaccel.
• HES – reported to be associated with a higher mean daily UOP, fewer paracenteses,
and shorter hospital stay than human albumin.
• Avoid diuretics as they deplete intravascular volume. They may have a role with
careful haemodynamic monitoring in cases where oliguria persists despite adequate
intravascular volume expansion and a normal intra-abdominal pressure.

SECTION 4

Subfertility

Prevention of thrombosis

• Incidence of thrombosis is 0.7–10%, with an apparent preponderance of upper body
sites and frequent involvement of the arterial system. Unusual neurological symptoms
should raise the possibility of a thrombotic episode in an uncommon location.
• Thromboprophylaxis to all women admitted to hospital.
* Full-length venous support stockings and prophylactic heparin.
* Intermittent pneumatic compression device if patient is confined to bed.
• In women who do not conceive, discontinue thromboprophylaxis with resolution of
OHSS. In women who conceive, the risk of thrombosis persists into the first trimester
of pregnancy; therefore, consider the risks and benefits of heparin prophylaxis until
the end of the first trimester, or even longer, depending on the presence of risk factors
and course of the OHSS.
• Therapeutic anticoagulation if thromboembolism is suspected, and manage
accordingly.

Surgical management
• Paracentesis – indications:
* Women distressed with significant discomfort or respiratory compromise due to severe
abdominal distension.
* Oliguria persisting despite adequate volume replacement. Relief of intra-abdominal pressure
may promote renal perfusion and improve UOP.
* Under USS guidance to avoid inadvertent puncture of vascular ovaries distended by large
luteal cysts.
* Avoid repeated paracenteses.
* To avoid cardiovascular collapse from massive fluid shifts, control the rate of ascitic fluid
drainage, administer IV colloids, and monitor BP and pulse.
• Symptomatic hydrothorax – drainage of ascites may suffice to resolve hydrothorax; however, if
it persists, may be drained directly.
• Adnexal torsion or coincident problems requiring surgery:
* Experienced surgeon following careful assessment.
* Untwisting of the twisted adnexa followed by observation of improved colour at laparoscopy
or laparotomy is associated with a favourable prognosis for ovarian function.

CHAPTER 23 Fertility sparing treatments in gynaecological cancers
Annually in the UK, over 1000 women with cervical cancer, 120 with endometrial cancer, and over 500 with
ovarian cancer present before the age of 45 years.

Cervical cancer
Up to 43% of all cervical cancers diagnosed are in women under the age of 45 years.

Stage IA1 – cone biopsy

Stage IA2 – cone biopsy and laparoscopic pelvic node dissection

• Stage IA1 squamous cell carcinoma – risk of < 1% of lymph node involvement compared with 5% in
women with tumour invading to a depth > 3 mm. Manage with knife/laser cone biopsy or LLETZ,
provided the excisional margins are free of dysplasia or invasive disease and there is no lymphovascular
space invasion. Further cone biopsy may be performed if the surgical margins are involved.
• Stage IA1 adenocarcinoma – knife cone biopsy with the depth of the cone being at least 25 mm and clear
margins of 5 mm or more.
• LLETZ – diathermy can make pathological assessment difficult because of the heat artefact. To obtain a
2.5 cm depth of cervical tissue, two loop specimens may be necessary, whereas with a knife or laser cone
one specimen can be obtained. Staging can be more accurately assessed with one intact specimen.
• Knife cone biopsy – increased risk of PTD, LBW and CS. Meta-analysis – PTD rate is related to the
proportion of the cervix removed; delivery before 37 weeks of gestation is 11% vs 7% in controls.

• Stage IA2 squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma of the
cervix – large cone biopsy and laparoscopic pelvic node dissection.
Tumours < 1 cm in diameter have a 0.6% chance of parametrial
involvement and lymph node spread is up to 5%. Therefore, a
pelvic node dissection is required as part of the treatment. However,
the lesion on the cervix is very small and local treatment need not
be radical.

Stage IB1

Radical vaginal trachelectomy (RVT)

Radical abdominal trachelectomy (RAT)

• Laparoscopic lymph node dissection and radical removal of the upper vagina, cervix, and paracervical
tissue vaginally, leaving the body and fundus of the uterus to allow conception. A permanent cerclage
suture is placed around the isthmic portion of the uterus to decrease the incidence of mid and late
pregnancy loss. Any subsequent pregnancies are delivered by CS.
• Tumour diameter should be < 2 cm, grade 1–2, with no lymphovascular space invasion.
• 10–12% of patients require adjunctive treatment for positive margins, positive lymph nodes, or poor
prognostic features. No significant difference in recurrence rates after RVT compared with radical
hysterectomy (5.8% vs 4.4%) with a 5-year survival of 97% in both groups.
• A significantly higher recurrence rate with tumours > 2 cm in diameter; therefore, restrict the use of RVT to
those with smaller tumours.
• Intraoperative and postoperative complication rates similar to radical hysterectomy. Approximately 15% of
RVT patients develop cervical stenosis, which can lead to dysmenorrhoea or infection.
• 41–79% conception rate is reported. The rate of miscarriage in first trimester is similar to the background
population at 16–20%, but there is 8–10% risk of second trimester miscarriage. Only 70–75% of
pregnancies deliver at term (> 37 weeks of gestation), but the risk of significant prematurity is only 12%.

• Similar to radical hysterectomy. Dissect the parametrium and remove
the paracervical tissue as a radical hysterectomy; by laparotomy or
laparoscopically.
• Whereas RVT should be restricted to tumours < 2 cm in diameter, this
technique may be useful in tumours > 2 cm that would otherwise need
a radical hysterectomy.
• Data from 94 women – 3 recurrences, 2 deaths, and 5/20 women
successfully conceived.
Simple hysterectomy with pelvic lymph node dissection may be an option
for Stage IB1 tumours, with possibility of ovarian preservation.

SECTION 4

Subfertility

Cervical cancer (contd.)

Stage IB2 and above – ovarian transposition and oocyte retrieval

• Advanced cervical cancers (pelvic nodal metastasis or parametrial invasion) are treated with pelvic radiation
and chemotherapy. Radiation destroys ovarian function.
• Ovarian transposition – repositioning the ovaries outside the field of radiation, relocating them into the
paracolic gutters at the level of the lower ribs with preserved blood supply to preserve ovarian function.
It can be performed at laparotomy during the time of surgical treatment, or laparoscopically prior to
chemoradiation. It does not protect against the risks associated with chemotherapy.
• It may prevent early menopause and ovaries may be used later for oocyte retrieval, IVF, and surrogate
pregnancy. However, there is still a high risk of ovarian failure. There have been reports of ovarian cyst
formation in the transposed ovary as well as vascular injuries.
• There have been reports of pregnancy.
• IVF – oocyte or embryo freezing. Disadvantage of delaying the treatment in order for hormonal stimulation.
Transposition of the ovaries can be performed after egg retrieval, but may be complicated due to the
increased size of the ovaries caused by the hormonal stimulation required.

Endometrial cancer
6% of endometrial cancers are diagnosed in women under the age of 50 years.
Stage IA endometrial cancer – progesterone treatment

• Case reports of stage IA grade 1 being treated with MPA, megestrol acetate, tamoxifen, and
gonadotrophin-releasing hormone analogue.
• Concerns:
* Accurate staging – hysteroscopy, dilatation and curettage, and MRI (MRI has a 90%
accuracy) may lead to underestimation of the staging. Disease that is curable with
hysterectomy may progress to advanced incurable disease.
* 10–29% of young women with endometrial cancer will have coexisting ovarian cancer.
• LNG-IUS – very limited evidence. There are reports of disease progression while the
LNG-IUS was in place and, therefore, it is not recommended on its own.
• No consensus on the appropriate duration of treatment. Endometrium may need to be
sampled at 3-monthly intervals and the time to response varies between 3 and 12 months.
• There is no consensus on long-term treatment. It is likely that a hysterectomy after
childbearing will decrease the risk of long-term disease.

• Response rate is 75% and there is no evidence that those who do not respond have a
poorer prognosis than if they had proceeded to hysterectomy initially.
• Recurrence rate is 23%; can be re-treated 3 or 4 times in order to give a window of
opportunity to conceive.
• There is a high risk of recurrence and survival chances may be compromised.
• Fertility rates tend to be lower and most series have offered assisted conception
immediately following complete response.
• A total of 89 live births have been recorded in the 278 women in these studies.
• There is currently no evidence to suggest a difference in the pregnancy outcomes once
conception has been achieved.

http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/CBO9781316156513.024

Ovarian cancer
Approximately 10% of ovarian cancers are in women of reproductive age.
The most common ovarian tumours in young women are germ cell tumours.

Stage I germ cell tumours confined to one ovary – unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (USO)

Borderline epithelial ovarian tumours – USO

• Survival rate – 98% for dysgerminoma, 90% for endodermal sinus, 100% for mixed types,
and 100% for immature teratoma. Survival rates are not significantly different from those
of women who were not treated conservatively.
• 88% of women were able to conceive and 69% had a full-term delivery.
• Metastatic germ cell ovarian tumours – unilateral oophorectomy or guided biopsy should
be taken to confirm the diagnosis and neoadjuvant chemotherapy should be given.
Germ cell tumours are very chemosensitive and an excellent response is expected. If the
diagnosis is made by biopsy and the ovary still appears abnormal on scanning at the end of
chemotherapy, then a unilateral oophorectomy should be performed.

• Epithelial ovarian tumours account for 85% of ovarian cancers. Approximately 10% are
borderline tumours and about 25% of these are in women of childbearing age.
• Most are confined to the ovaries and can be managed conservatively with preservation of
the uterus and contralateral ovary.
• The survival rates are 95–97% at 5 years, recurrences tend to occur late and this can give a
false sense of reassurance.
• If the tumour is bilateral, bilateral ovarian cystectomy may be performed.
• Successful pregnancy outcomes have been documented.
• Recurrence rates are generally higher; however, survival rates are similar to those in women
who have undergone hysterectomy and BSO.

Stage I epithelial ovarian cancer – USO

• USO to women who wish to retain their fertility. However, these women will need full surgical staging, as metastasis occurs in
15–20% of women with apparent stage I ovarian cancer.
• Endometrial biopsy is needed as 10–29% of women have a coexisting endometrial cancer.
• Full staging may be performed laparoscopically. The incidence of laparoscopic tumour rupture is similar to laparotomy and port
site metastasis is low. If the diameter of the ovarian cyst exceeds a 15 mm endobag, then perform a laparotomy.
• No additional benefit with taking a biopsy from a normal contralateral ovary. However, if the uterus and the contralateral ovary
are to be preserved, there is presumably a risk that microscopic metastatic disease will not be recognized, leading to an increased
risk of recurrence. In 2.5% the contralateral ovary has microscopic disease.
• A review (507 women) – 10% chance of recurrence and 5.5% chance of death from disease, which is comparable to historical
controls. A total of 186 full-term deliveries were recorded. Recurrent disease confined to the preserved ovary in 4–6%.
• European Society of Gynecologic Oncology – Stage IA grade 1 and possibly grade 2 tumours of mucinous, endometrioid, or
serous types are suitable for fertility sparing surgery. Grade 1 stage IC could also be considered.

SECTION 4

Subfertility

Fertility preservation
•
•
•
•

Where fertility sparing surgery is not appropriate, undertake embryo cryopreservation.
There are no guarantees that this method will result in a successful pregnancy.
Surrogacy will be required if the uterus is removed.
Provision of sex hormone replacement should be in line with other long-term replacement therapies.

Sperm banking

Oocyte/embryo cryopreservation

Ovarian tissue cryopreservation

• Consider for all males prior to treatment that
carries a risk of long-term gonadal damage.
• Testicular sperm extraction is sometimes possible
even when azoospermia is present.

• Technically challenging and requires ovarian stimulation,
with a potential delay in cancer treatment.
• It may be contraindicated if the tumour is thought to be
hormone sensitive although there are no scientific data.

• Can be performed without significant delay,
but success rates from its use remain unclear.

Oocyte cryopreservation

Embryo cryopreservation

• Oocyte vitrification may offer increased success rates
in comparison with slow freezing, but is limited by the
number of oocytes that can be obtained.
• This technique carries only a 3–5% chance of
resulting in a successful pregnancy per frozen egg.

• Embryo storage prior to treatment is possible for the minority
of patients with a partner and sufficient time for IVF.
• Limited data on its success rates in achieving pregnancy.

People with cancer who wish to preserve fertility
• There is no fixed lower age limit for cryopreservation for fertility preservation in people
diagnosed with cancer.
• Consider – diagnosis, treatment plan, expected outcome of subsequent fertility treatment,
prognosis of the cancer treatment, viability of stored/post-thawed material.
• Sperm cryopreservation for men and adolescent boys who are preparing for chemotherapy
that is likely to make them infertile. Use freezing in liquid nitrogen vapour as the preferred
cryopreservation technique for sperm.
• Oocyte or embryo cryopreservation for women of reproductive age who are preparing
for chemotherapy that is likely to make them infertile if: they are well enough to undergo
ovarian stimulation and egg collection and this will not worsen their condition, and enough
time is available before the start of their cancer treatment. Use vitrification instead of
controlled-rate freezing if the necessary equipment and expertise is available.
• Store cryopreserved material for an initial period of 10 years. Do not continue to store
cryopreserved sperm beyond 10 years for a man whose normal fertility has been restored
by the time he is discharged from oncology follow-up.

SECTION 5

U rogynaecology, pelvic floor problems, and hormone replacement therapy

CHAPTER 24 Urinary incontinence (UI)

Prevalence and incidence
•
•
•
•

Definition: any involuntary urinary leakage (International Continence Society (ICS)).
Prevalence underreported.
Stress UI (SUI) is reported in 50%, only urge UI (UUI) in 11%, and mixed UI in 36%.
UK – UI is reported in 20% of people aged ≥ 40 years, increases to 36% at age ≥ 80.

History
• Urinary symptoms – determine storage and voiding patterns.
* Storage symptoms: frequency, nocturia, urgency, UUI, SUI, constant leakage (fistula).
* Voiding symptoms: hesitancy, straining to void, poor or intermittent urinary stream.
* Post-micturition symptoms: sensation of incomplete emptying, post-micturition
dribbling.
* Symptoms such as haematuria, persisting bladder or urethral pain may indicate a more
serious diagnosis.
• Bowel symptoms:
* Constipation and straining can contribute to loss of bladder control by weakening pelvic
floor muscles and may predispose to UI and adversely affect the outcome of continence
surgery.
* Faecal incontinence may suggest the presence of cognitive impairment, neurological and/
or anatomical damage.
• Obstetric and gynaecological history:
* Number and type of deliveries and their outcome, woman’s desire for further
childbearing.
* Menstrual history, menopausal status, symptoms of prolapse, sexual function.
• Medical history – conditions that may exacerbate or coexist with UI or OAB – neurological
system (e.g., multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury), metabolic system (e.g., diabetes),
cardiorespiratory system, renal system.
• Surgical history – previous surgery for UI or for prolapse may complicate diagnosis and
treatment. Any surgery that might have interfered with normal nerve supply to the bladder
or urethra, e.g., low spinal surgery, radical hysterectomy.
• Drug history – drugs may be associated with UI. Drugs that affect:
* CNS, e.g., sedatives, hypnotics, anxiolytics, and smooth muscle relaxants.
* Autonomic nervous system, e.g., drugs with antimuscarinic action, sympathomimetics,
and sympatholytics.
* Fluid balance, e.g., diuretics and alcohol.
* Previous medication for UI symptoms.
• Occupational, social, personal history – assess social and functional impact of UI,
expectations, and motivation.
• Lifestyle factors such as smoking and BMI.

Background and definition
• Urodynamic SUI – demonstration of involuntary leakage of urine during increased
abdominal pressure but in the absence of detrusor contraction during filling cystometry.
• UUI – involuntary urine leakage accompanied by or immediately preceded by urgency.
• Overactive bladder (OAB) syndrome – urgency, with or without UUI, usually with
frequency and nocturia. OAB wet is where UUI is present, and OAB dry is where
incontinence is absent.
• Mixed urinary incontinence (MUI) – involuntary leakage associated with urgency and also
with exertion, effort, sneezing, or coughing.
• Chronic urinary retention (overflow incontinence) occurs when the bladder cannot empty
completely and becomes over-distended.
• Detrusor over-activity is a urodynamic observation characterized by involuntary detrusor
contractions during the filling phase, which may be spontaneous or provoked.

Risk factors
• Age.
• Obstetric factors – risk of SUI is increased in women who developed SUI for the first time
during their first pregnancy or during the first 6 weeks postpartum. There is an association
of vaginal delivery, increased parity, and heavier birth weight with SUI.
• Menopause, hysterectomy.
• Obesity. • Smoking.
• Lower urinary tract symptoms.
• Functional impairment, cognitive impairment.
• Family history. • Diet and genetics. • Neurological disease.

Risks or complications
• Psychological problems: depression, feelings of shame, loss of self confidence,
poor self-rated health, low self esteem, impairment in QOL.
• Social isolation.
• Sexual problems: loss of urine during sexual intercourse may cause embarrassment and
relationship problems.
• Loss of sleep: nocturia is associated with sleep disruption.
• Constipation: owing to limiting fluid intake.
• Falls and fractures: particularly in older people.

Comparison of urinary history with urodynamic assessment (UDA)

Examination and assessment

• Assess cognitive impairment.
• Abdominal examination – enlarged bladder (chronic urinary retention) or pelvic mass.
• Speculum/vaginal examination – identify and assess prolapse, atrophic changes, infection and
excoriation,uterine and ovarian enlargement, urine leak on straining. Ask women to cough and bear
down, which may demonstrate SUI or presence of cystocele or rectocele.
• Rectal examination – evaluate posterior vaginal wall prolapse.
• Neurophysiology – where history suggests neurological disease, examination of lower limbs together with
sacral sensation and sacral reflexes.
• Pelvic floor muscle assessment: * Digital palpation. * EMG. * Perineometry.
• There is a lack of evidence as to whether digital assessment of pelvic floor muscle contraction affects
the outcome of pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT). However, the determination of whether a woman
can contract pelvic floor muscles will direct treatment decisions. Assess pelvic floor muscle contraction
digitally before the use of supervised PFMT for the treatment of UI.
• Assess residual urine in women suspected of voiding dysfunction. Large post-void residual urine may
indicate the presence of underlying bladder outlet obstruction, neurological disease, or detrusor failure.
Methods used to measure post-void residual urine – abdominal palpation, USS, and catheterization.
The sensitivity and specificity of USS in comparison with catheterization are within clinically acceptable
limits. USS is less invasive with fewer side effects. Measure post-void residual volume by bladder scan
or catheterization in women with symptoms suggestive of voiding dysfunction or recurrent UTI. Use a
bladder scan in preference to catheterization on the grounds of acceptability and less adverse events.

Initial assessment and referral
•
•
•
•

At the initial clinical assessment, categorize woman’s UI as SUI, mixed UI, or UUI/OAB.
Commence initial treatment on this basis.
In mixed UI, treat the predominant symptom.
Identify relevant predisposing and precipitating factors and other diagnoses that may require referral for
additional investigation and treatment.

Assessment
Bladder diaries – a reliable method of quantifying urinary frequency and incontinence.
• These are used to document each cycle of filling and voiding over a number of days and can provide
information about urinary frequency, urgency, diurnal and nocturnal cycles, functional bladder capacity,
fluid intake, urine output, leakage episodes, pad changes, and give an indication of the severity of wetness.
They may also be used for monitoring the effects of treatment.
• Optimum duration of bladder diaries is unclear. They should be used in the initial assessment with a
minimum of 3 days of the diary covering variations in their usual activities.
Symptom scoring and QOL assessment – to quantify the impact of urinary symptoms and to provide a measure that can be used to assess outcomes of treatment.
Pad tests – to detect and quantify urine loss. While there is no evidence of diagnostic value or clinical utility,
the pad tests may be useful for evaluating therapies for incontinence. They are not recommended in the routine assessment of women with UI.
Cystoscopy – the direct visualization of the bladder and urethral lumen. It identifies areas of inflammation,
tumour, stones, and diverticula, all of which will require referral.
• Evidence does not support the role of cystoscopy in the assessment of women with UI. It may be of value
in women with pain or recurrent UTI following previous pelvic surgery, or where a fistula is suspected; its
place in recurrent SUI without these additional features is less clear.
• Cystoscopy is not recommended in the initial assessment of women with UI alone.
121

• If there is no history of mixed UI (i.e., pure SUI or pure UUI), the probability of
finding SUI plus detruser overactivity on cystometry is small (10%), therefore UDA
offers little additional diagnostic value.
• If no pure UUI, the probability of finding DO on cystometry is small (10%),
therefore UDA offers little added diagnostic value.
• Pure SUI – 15–51% of women who do not report pure SUI may be found to have
SUI on cystometry.
• Low level of agreement between a history of urinary symptoms and UDA.
• However, women who do not report mixed or UUI are unlikely to have findings of
mixed UI or DO on UDA.
• In the absence of evidence that UDA improves the outcome of women treated
conservatively, and without robust evidence that UDA provides additional valuable
information to the history alone in the initial assessment of women with UI, UDA
is not required before initiating conservative treatment.

Referral indications
Urgent

• Microscopic haematuria in women aged ≥ 50 years. • Visible haematuria.
• Recurrent or persisting UTI associated with haematuria in women aged ≥ 40 years.
• Suspected malignant mass arising from the urinary tract.
Routine
• Symptomatic prolapse that is visible at or below the vaginal introitus.
• Palpable bladder after voiding. • Persisting bladder or urethral pain.
• Clinically benign pelvic masses. • Associated faecal incontinence.
• Suspected neurological disease. • Symptoms of voiding difficulty.
• Suspected urogenital fistulae.
• Previous continence surgery, pelvic cancer surgery, pelvic radiotherapy.

Urine dipstick test

• Urine dipstick for blood, glucose, protein, leucocytes, and nitrites.
• Urine dipstick test for leucocytes and nitrites has low sensitivity and high
specificity for the diagnosis of UTI. A negative test excludes a UTI with a high
degree of certainty. However, only one third of positive tests are associated with
bacteriologically proven UTI.
• False negatives can arise when infection occurs with organisms that do not convert
nitrates to nitrites. Hence, in symptomatic patients with a negative test, consider
prescribing antibiotics before results of urine culture are available.
• In patients with symptoms of UTI and a positive urine test for leucocytes and
nitrites, infection is highly likely and prescribe antibiotics immediately.
• MSU for culture and antibiotic sensitivities before prescribing in all.
• Women with symptoms of UTI with urine test:
* Positive for both leucocytes and nitrites – prescribe antibiotics pending culture.
* Negative for leucocytes or nitrites – consider antibiotics pending culture results.
• Women who do not have symptoms of UTI with urine test
* Positive for both leucocytes and nitrites – do not offer antibiotics without the
results of MSU culture.
* Negative for leucocytes or nitrites – unlikely UTI, do not send a urine culture.

SECTION 5

U rogynaecology, pelvic floor problems, and hormone replacement therapy

Investigations and assessment of severity
Urodynamic assessment (UDA) – a number of varied physiological tests of bladder and urethral function,
which aim to demonstrate an underlying abnormality of storage or voiding.

Cystometry

Tests of urethral function

Measurement of intra-vesical pressure – by single recording channel (simple cystometry) or by multichannel cystometry
(measurement of both bladder and intra-abdominal pressures by means of catheters inserted into the bladder and the
rectum or vagina). The aim is to replicate the woman’s symptoms by filling the bladder and observing pressure changes
or leakage caused by provocation tests. Multichannel cystometry may reveal the underlying pathophysiological explanation of incontinence. Single-channel cystometry is less reliable.
• A clinical stress test may be as accurate as multichannel cystometry in the diagnosis of USI.
• There is no evidence that pre-treatment multichannel cystometry will improve the outcomes of treatments for UI.
Although some urodynamic parameters have been found to correlate with adverse outcomes of surgery such as
voiding difficulty and OAB, no test has been shown to reliably predict beneficial or adverse outcomes of surgery.
• Uroflowmetry entails a free-flow void into a recording device, which provides the information about the volume of
urine passed and the rate of urine flow.
• Videourodynamics – synchronous radiographic screening of the bladder with multichannel cystometry. It has the
benefit of simultaneous structural and functional assessment; however, it is not clear whether this adds any relevant
diagnostic accuracy, compared with multichannel cystometry.
• Ambulatory urodynamics involves multichannel cystometry carried out with physiological bladder filling rates and
using portable recording devices. It demonstrates functional abnormalities more often than multichannel cystometry,
but the significance of this is unclear.
• Use of multichannel cystometry, ambulatory urodynamics, or videourodynamics is not recommended before starting
conservative treatment.
• For women with a clearly defined clinical diagnosis of pure SUI, the use of multichannel cystometry is not routinely
recommended.
• Multichannel cystometry is recommended in women before surgery if:
* There is clinical suspicion of detrusor overactivity.
* There has been previous surgery for USI or anterior compartment prolapse.
* There are symptoms suggestive of voiding dysfunction.
* Ambulatory urodynamics or videourodynamics may also be considered in these circumstances.

• Urethral pressure profilometry and leak point pressure measurement.
These are used to derive values that reflect the ability of the urethra
to resist urine flow, expressed as maximum urethral closure pressure
(MUCP); or as abdominal, cough, or Valsalva leak point pressures
(ALPP, CLPP, VLPP).
• Q-tip, POP-Q, Bonney, Marshall, and fluid-bridge tests have
been developed to evaluate the mobility or competence of the
urethrovesical junction.
• Q-tip test – placing a sterile Q-tip in the urethra and the woman is
asked to bear down. If the Q-tip moves more than 30°, the test is
considered positive.
• Bonney and Marshall tests – pressing either the index and middle
finger of the examiner’s hand (Bonney test) or the jaws of a forceps
(Marshall test) against the anterior vaginal wall, without pressing on
the urethra. The stress provocation test is repeated and if no leakage
occurs, the Bonney or Marshall test is said to be positive.
• Fluid-bridge test is designed to test bladder neck competence by
testing for the presence of fluid within the urethra, by demonstrating
continuity between two channels of a pressure-recording catheter
(one in the bladder and the other in the urethra).
• Q-tip, Bonney, Marshall and fluid-bridge tests demonstrate no
evidence to support their role in the clinical assessment of UI,
therefore these tests are not recommended in the assessment of
women with UI.

Imaging

• USS, X-ray, CT, MRI – for confirmation of alternative pelvic pathology which is an indication for referral.
• Imaging may be used to characterize the extent and anatomical contents of a prolapse, especially in the standing position, with MRI.
• USS – diagnosis of post-void residual urine, bladder wall thickness, bladder neck positioning, specific urethral measurements, and the
posterior urethrovesical angle.
• Bladder wall thickness of > 5 mm has sensitivity of 84%, specificity 89%, and PPV 94% for diagnosing DO.
• Correlation of anatomical shape or movement with SUI is not clear.
• There is a lack of evidence regarding the use of MRI or CT in the assessment of women with UI.
• Imaging is not recommended for the routine assessment of women with UI.
• USS is not recommended other than for the assessment of residual urine volume.

Management

Non-therapeutic interventions
Lifestyle – general measures

• There is a lack of data on the effects of modifying lifestyle factors such as bowel habit
and dietary factors in women with UI or OAB.
• Constipation and increased straining in early adult life may be associated with an
increased tendency to prolapse and UI, but no evidence on the effect of modifying
bowel habit on continence is identified.
• Increased caffeine intake may be associated with OAB and UI. There is some evidence
that caffeine reduction leads to less urgency and frequency when used in addition to
bladder training. Give a trial of caffeine reduction for the treatment of OAB.
• There is evidence of an association between obesity and UI or OAB. Weight reduction
of at least 5% is associated with relief of UI symptoms. Advise women with UI or
OAB who have a BMI > 30 to lose weight.
• Smoking is associated with an increased risk of UI and OAB although there is no
evidence relating to smoking cessation in the management of these symptoms.

Management – SUI

• Acupuncture, hypnosis, herbal medicines – poor-quality evidence shows that acupuncture may
reduce nocturia and both SUI and UUI in the short term.
• Hypnotherapy – limited evidence of some benefit over the short term for UUI.
• Lack of evidence on herbal medicines for UI or OAB.
• Do not recommend complementary therapies for the treatment of UI or OAB.
• Catheters – intermittent catheterization is associated with reduced risk of UTI compared with
indwelling catheterization.
• Bladder catheterization (intermittent or indwelling urethral or suprapubic) – consider for women
in whom persistent urinary retention is causing incontinence, symptomatic infections, or renal
dysfunction.
• Products to prevent leakage – intravaginal devices: continence guard, bladder neck support
prosthesis, meatal devices, a urethral plug. Intravaginal and intraurethral devices are not
recommended. Do not advise women to consider such devices other than for occasional use when
necessary to prevent leakage, for example during physical exercise.
• Pessaries – the limited evidence does not support the use of ring pessaries for the treatment of UI in
women whether or not there is prolapse present.

SECTION 5

U rogynaecology, pelvic floor problems, and hormone replacement therapy

Management – SUI

Physical therapies
Medical management

Surgical management

Pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT)

Weighted vaginal cones

Electrical stimulation

• Contraction of pelvic floor muscles (PFM) causes inward lift of
the muscles, with resultant increase in urethral closure pressure,
stabilization and resistance to downward movement.
• Daily PFMT is an effective treatment for SUI or mixed UI
compared with no treatment over the short term. Side effects may
be pain or discomfort.
• PFMT is more cost effective than duloxetine, as first-line treatment
for SUI.
• PFMT used during a first pregnancy reduces the prevalence of UI
at 3 months following delivery. The effects in the longer term are
inconsistent and the impact of subsequent pregnancies unknown.
Offer PFMT to women in their first pregnancy as a preventive
strategy for UI.

• Cone-shaped appliances of various weights are used
to facilitate strengthening of PFMs. Passive and
active contractions of the PFMs prevent the cones
from slipping out of the vagina.
• In women with SUI, vaginal cones are more
effective than no treatment. No difference in
effectiveness between cones and PFMT.
• Vaginal cones are inappropriate in – moderate
to severe prolapse, too narrow or too capacious
a vagina causing difficulty with insertion or
misplacement of the cone, untreated atrophic
vaginitis, vaginal infection, menstruation, or
pregnancy.

• Application of electrical current, usually via vaginal
electrodes, to stimulate the PFMs.
• Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) –
electrical nerve stimulation in which the electrodes are
placed over the dermatomes of S2 to S4 for long periods
of time, daily. Limited data on its efficacy.
• Stoller afferent nerve stimulator (SANS) – inserting a
fine-gauge needle into the posterior tibial nerve just
above the ankle. The tibial nerve then carries an electrical
stimulation in an afferent direction to the sacral spine.
• No evidence of additional benefit of electrical stimulation
in combination with PFMT compared with PFMT alone.

Biofeedback

• Promotes awareness of the physiological action of PFMs
by visual, tactile, or auditory means, e.g., by manometry or
electromyography (EMG).
• No evidence of additional benefit from biofeedback with PFMT in
comparison with PFMT alone in treating UI.
• Biofeedback with PFMT is more costly than PFMT alone and
therefore is not cost-effective given a lack of additional benefit.

• Duloxetine – a serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor that acts chiefly in the sacral spinal cord. The
resultant increase in pudendal nerve activity increases urethral sphincter contraction and closure pressure.
• Side effects – nausea, dry mouth, constipation, fatigue, insomnia, dizziness, increased sweating, vomiting,
somnolence, and discontinuation rates.
• Associated with a reduction in leakage episodes, an increased voiding interval, and improved QOL in women
with SUI or mixed UI where stress-related leakage is the predominant symptom.
• Offer duloxetine as a second-line treatment, but only if the woman prefers it to surgical treatment or is not
suitable for surgical treatment.

Recommendations
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Offer a trial of supervised PFMT of at least 3 months duration as a first-line treatment to women with SUI or mixed UI.
PFMT programme should comprise at least 8 contractions performed 3 times per day.
Advise women to maintain an exercise programme, if PFMT is beneficial.
Do not use perineometry or pelvic floor electromyography as biofeedback as a routine part of PFMT.
Do not use electrical stimulation routinely in the treatment of women with OAB or in combination with PFMT.
Consider electrical stimulation and/or biofeedback in women who cannot actively contract PFMs in order to aid motivation and adherence to therapy.
Duloxetine:
* Do not use as a first-line treatment for SUI.
* Do not routinely use as a second-line treatment for SUI.
* Consider and offer as an alternative to surgical treatment.
* Counsel women about adverse effects.

Surgical management

To support or stabilize bladder neck or urethra

To augment urethral closure

Others

Objective is to prevent the downward displacement of the urethra

• Retropubic suspension procedures secure the paraurethral or vaginal tissues
to a fixed structure by sutures. Burch colposuspension, Marshall–Marchetti–
Krantz (MMK) and vagino-obturator shelf procedure.
• Colposuspension – open or laparoscopic.
• Open colposuspension is an effective treatment and has longevity. There is no
difference in effectiveness between laparoscopic and open colposuspension.
However, laparoscopic colposuspension consumes more resources and skills
take longer to acquire.
• Complications are common – voiding difficulty, urgency syndrome,
development of vaginal vault and posterior wall prolapse.
• No evidence that the MMK procedure offers any advantage over open
colposuspension. MMK procedure is no longer in routine clinical practice
owing to the serious additional complication of osteitis pubis.
• Minimally invasive procedures that suspend the paraurethral tissues by means
of a suspensory suture, usually inserted under endoscopic control and secured
to the rectus sheath to provide support. These include the Raz, Pereyra,
Stamey, and Gittes procedures.

• Sling operations aim to stabilize the urethra by placing a strip of material around the underside of the urethra
and securing the ends to a fixed structure above, with ‘no tension’ under the urethra.
• These could be classified according to:
* The tissues to which they are fixed (pubic arch or rectus sheath).
* The route by which they are inserted: open abdominal, combined abdominovaginal; minimally invasive.
* Retropubic space (from bottom upwards or from top downwards).
* Obturator foramen (from outside inwards/from inside outwards).
* The materials used.
• Most RCT data regarding synthetic slings for the treatment of SUI relate to a macroporous (type 1)
polypropylene mesh inserted through the retropubic space using a bottom-up approach (TVT). This has
comparable efficacy to colposuspension, less use of hospital resources, more cost-effective, and shorter
recovery time. Limited data on outcomes beyond 3 years.
• Higher prevalence of prolapse in open colposuspension would increase the relative cost effectiveness of TVT.
• Slings inserted through the obturator foramen appear to be effective in the short term.
• Intraoperative complications are rare except for bladder perforation, which, although common, has no
long-term sequelae provided it is recognized and repaired at the time of surgery.
• Long-term complications – voiding difficulties and development of urgency and UUI.

To augment urethral closure

Others

• Operations to augment sphincter closure:
* Injection of urethral bulking agents and implants that aim to occlude the urethra.
* Intramural urethral bulking procedures.
* Extraurethral retropubic adjustable compression devices.
• Artificial urinary sphincter – a complex device that comprises an occlusive cuff inserted around the urethra, which,
while inflated, will exert a constant closure pressure. Pressure is maintained by means of an inflated pressure-regulating
balloon. A small pump located in the labium is manually operated by the woman whenever she wishes to pass urine.
• Data supporting the use of an artificial urinary sphincter are limited. Subjective cure rates are high although
complications requiring removal or revision are common.
• Bulking agents may be less effective than open surgery, but are associated with fewer postoperative complications.
• Urethral bulking agents have relatively poor efficacy. Any benefit observed declines with time, and complications,
although common, are transient; include acute retention, dysuria, haematuria, frequency, and UTI. De novo DO with
urge UI is the only long-term complication.

• Anterior colporrhaphy and abdominal paravaginal repair are aimed
primarily at treating prolapse but may have a secondary effect in
preventing associated SUI.
• Most suspension procedures are effective in the short term but
the longer-term outcomes for anterior colporrhaphy, abdominal
paravaginal repair, and needle suspension are poor when used for
SUI alone.

SECTION 5

U rogynaecology, pelvic floor problems, and hormone replacement therapy

Surgical management

Recommendations
• Retropubic mid-urethral tape procedures using a ‘bottom-up’ approach with macroporous
(type 1) polypropylene meshes.
• Open colposuspension and autologous rectus fascial sling are alternatives.
• Synthetic slings using a retropubic ‘top-down’ or a transobturator foramen approach
provided women are made aware of the lack of long-term outcome data.
• Intramural bulking agents (glutaraldehyde cross-linked collagen, silicone, carbon-coated
zirconium beads, or hyaluronic acid/dextran co-polymer). Inform women that repeat
injections may be required to achieve efficacy; efficacy diminishes with time; efficacy is
inferior to that of retropubic suspension or sling.
• In view of the associated morbidity, consider the use of an artificial urinary sphincter only if
previous surgery has failed. Life-long follow-up is recommended.

What not to do
• Synthetic slings using materials other than polypropylene that are not of a macroporous
(type 1) construction.
• Laparoscopic colposuspension as a routine procedure.
• Anterior colporrhaphy, needle suspensions, paravaginal defect repair, and the Marshall–
Marchetti–Krantz procedure.
• Autologous fat and polytetrafluoroethylene as intramural bulking agents.

Management of OAB or mixed UI

Behavioural therapies

• Women with OAB usually void more frequently than usual owing to
urgency. Bladder training involves the individual, attempting to increase
the interval between the desire to void and the actual void. Either by
mandatory schedules in which the individual may not use the toilet
between set times for voiding, or a self-scheduled regimen where the
patient gradually increases their inter-voiding times, and may use the toilet
between times if the urge becomes unbearable.
• Bladder training is more effective than no treatment in women with urge
or mixed UI. It has a similar subjective cure rate to oxybutynin in UUI but
adverse effects and relapse rates are lower. Offer bladder training lasting
for a minimum of 6 weeks as first-line treatment.
• The combination with oxybutynin or tolterodine results in greater
reduction in frequency of micturition but has not been shown to lead to
further improvements in incontinence.
• If women do not achieve satisfactory benefit, consider the combination
of an antimuscarinic agent with bladder training if frequency is a
troublesome symptom.
• In women with UI who also have cognitive impairment, prompted and
timed voiding toileting programmes are recommended for reducing
leakage episodes.

Surgical management

Medical management
Antimuscarinic drugs

• Block muscarinic receptors in the bladder, which reduces the ability of bladder muscle to contract and
affects bladder sensation. The drugs differ in their selectivity for various muscarinic receptors, and some
drugs have additional actions such as direct smooth muscle effects.
• Darifenacin, flavoxate, imipramine, and other tricyclic antidepressants.
• Oxybutynin, propantheline, propiverine, solifenacin, tolterodine.
• Extended release (ER) tolterodine, trospium.
• Darifenacin, oxybutynin, solifenacin, tolterodine, and trospium are associated with improvements in
frequency, leakage episodes, and improved QOL.
• No evidence of a clinically important difference in efficacy between antimuscarinic drugs.
• Immediate release (IR) oxybutynin is most cost effective.
• Propiverine may be associated with an improvement in frequency. Consider as an option to treat frequency
of urination in women with OAB, but is not recommended for the treatment of UI.
• Limited evidence that doxepin reduces night-time leakage episodes and nocturia.
• No evidence of efficacy of flavoxate, propantheline or imipramine.
• Antimuscarinic adverse effects are common with all. Dry mouth is more likely with oral IR oxybutynin.
• Offer IR non-proprietary oxybutynin as first-line antimuscarinic drug treatment, if bladder training has been
ineffective.
• If IR oxybutynin is not well tolerated, consider darifenacin, solifenacin, tolterodine, trospium, or an ER or
transdermal oxybutynin as alternatives.
• Counsel women about the adverse effects of antimuscarinic drugs. Review following any change in
antimuscarinic drug therapy.

Desmopressin (DDAVP)

Others

• A synthetic analogue of vasopressin/antidiuretic hormone, which acts by inhibiting
diuresis while avoiding vasopressive effects and significantly reduces nocturia.
• There is insufficient evidence that desmopressin reduces incontinence in adult
women.
• Symptomatic hyponatraemia may be more common in elderly women, and is more
likely to occur soon after treatment initiation. Monitor pre-treatment and early posttreatment (72 hours) serum sodium.
• Consider desmopressin specifically to reduce nocturia in women with UI or OAB
who find it a troublesome symptom.
• Use of desmopressin for nocturia in women with idiopathic UI is outside the UK
marketing authorization for the product.

• Diuretics – there is insufficient evidence to support the use of diuretics for the treatment of
nocturia in women with UI.
• Oestrogens – help to maintain health of the tissues that are essential for normal pressure
transmission in the urethra. Intravaginal oestrogens may improve symptoms of incontinence
and frequency in postmenopausal women who have urogenital symptoms secondary to
vaginal atrophy.
• Systemic oestrogen does not confer any benefit in women with UI and systemic HRT is not
recommended for the treatment of UI.
• Intravaginal oestrogens are recommended for the treatment of OAB symptoms in
postmenopausal women with vaginal atrophy.

SECTION 5

U rogynaecology, pelvic floor problems, and hormone replacement therapy

Surgical management
Aims to increase the capacity of the bladder, alter or modulate its nerve supply and contractility, or bypass the lower urinary tract completely.
The contractility of the detrusor is reduced, leading to difficulty in voiding, a very common adverse effect.

Sacral nerve stimulation (SNS) neuromodulation

Augmentation cystoplasty

Urinary diversion

• Appropriate electrical stimulation of the sacral reflex pathway
will inhibit the reflex behaviour of the bladder.
• Permanently implantable sacral root stimulators provide
chronic stimulation directly to the S3 nerve roots.
• Up to two thirds of patients achieve continence or substantial
improvement after SNS, and the beneficial effects appear to
persist for up to 3–5 years after implantation.
• Around one third of patients may require re-operation,
owing to pain at the implant site, infection, or the need for
adjustment and modification of the lead system.
• Permanent removal of the electrodes may be required in 1/10
patients.
• Offer sacral nerve stimulation for the treatment of UI owing
to DO in women who have not responded to conservative
treatments. Offer sacral nerve stimulation on the basis of their
response to preliminary percutaneous nerve evaluation. Lifelong follow-up is recommended.

• Aims to increase functional bladder capacity by bivalving the
bladder wall and incorporating a segment of bowel into the
resultant defect.
• Limited data. Improvement in at least half of patients with
idiopathic DO.
• Complications – bowel disturbance, metabolic acidosis,
mucus production and/or retention in the bladder, UTI, and
urinary retention are common and many patients will need to
self-catheterize.
• Malignant transformation in the bowel segment or urothelium
has been reported. Life-long follow-up is recommended.
• Augmentation cystoplasty for the management of idiopathic
detrusor overactivity should be restricted to women who have
not responded to conservative treatments and who are willing
and able to self-catheterize.

• Urine drainage is re-routed away from the
urethra by means of transposing the ureters to an
isolated segment of ileum, which is used to create
a permanent cutaneous stoma (ileal conduit).
• Limited data; vesical infection, stoma-related
problems, and the need for surgical revisions
occur very commonly.
• Consider urinary diversion for a woman with
OAB only when conservative treatments have
failed, and if sacral nerve stimulation and
augmentation cystoplasty are not appropriate or
are unacceptable.
• Life-long follow-up is recommended.

Detrusor myectomy

Botulinum toxin

• Aims to improve the functional bladder capacity by excising bladder
muscle from the fundus of the bladder while leaving the mucosa intact,
thus creating a permanent wide-necked diverticulum. The defect is
usually covered with a segment of mobilized omentum.
• While urodynamic parameters may improve in some patients, the
clinical outcomes are unclear; hence its role in the treatment of DO is
not yet established.

• A potent neurotoxin derived from the bacterium Clostridium botulinum. Two strains – types A and B.
Botulinum toxin blocks the release of acetylcholine and it will temporarily paralyse any muscle into which it
is injected. However, the precise mechanism of action when injected into the detrusor muscle is unknown.
• Can be injected directly into the bladder wall using a flexible cystoscope.
• Botulinum toxin A – limited data show improvement in about half of patients, with duration of benefit
between 3 and 12 months.
• Botulinum toxin B appears to be effective only in the short term (up to 6 weeks).
• Botulinum toxin A should be used in the treatment of idiopathic DO only in women who have not
responded to conservative treatments and who are willing and able to self-catheterize.
• Use of botulinum toxin A for this indication is outside the UK marketing authorization for the product.
• Botulinum toxin B is not recommended for the treatment of women with idiopathic OAB.

What not to do

• UDA before conservative treatment.
• Use of multichannel cystometry, ambulatory urodynamics or videourodynamics,
before starting conservative treatment.
• For women with a clearly defined clinical diagnosis of pure SUI, the use of
multichannel cystometry.
• Routine ultrasound, except to assess residual urine volume.

SECTION 5

U rogynaecology, pelvic floor problems, and hormone replacement therapy

CHAPTER 25 Uterovaginal prolapse

Background and prevalence
• Life-time risk for undergoing surgery for prolapse or urinary incontinence is 11%.
• Most common indication for hysterectomy in women aged ≥ 50 years.
• Descent of one or more pelvic structures:
* Uterine cervix or vagina apex – apical/uterine prolapse.
* Anterior vagina usually with the bladder – cystocele.
* Posterior vagina usually with the rectum – rectocele.
* Peritoneum of the cul-de-sac usually with the small intestine – enterocele.
* Vaginal apex after hysterectomy– vaginal vault prolapse.

Risk factors
• Age – prolapse is more common in older women.
• Parity – particularly with history of long or difficult labour, multiple births, or delivery of a
large baby. It is rare in women who have not had children.
• Menopause – owing to low levels of oestrogen resulting in weakening of tissue.
• High BMI – being overweight or obese creates extra pressure in the pelvic area.
• Previous pelvic surgery, such as hysterectomy or bladder repair.
• Factors associated with increased intra-abdominal pressure – heavy lifting and manual work,
long-term coughing (smoking), long-term constipation.
• Genetic predisposition.
• Conditions that cause weakening of the tissues and connective tissue disorder – joint
hypermobility syndrome, Marfan syndrome, Ehlers–Danlos syndrome, etc.

History
• Asymptomatic – incidental finding in some women. Up to half of all women who have had
children are affected by some degree of prolapse; however, most are clinically not affected.
• A sensation of something coming down or out of the vagina – progressive protrusion of the
bulge as the day goes on, or after long periods of physical exertion (lifting/standing).
• An uncomfortable feeling of fullness or heaviness.
• Difficulty having sex and difficulty walking.
• Backache or dragging sensation.
• Stress incontinence – severe prolapse may mask the symptoms of incontinence.
• Difficulty voiding or incomplete emptying of bladder/rectum. Might require manual pressure
for complete voiding.
• It can have a significant impact on a woman’s QOL.
The only symptom specific to prolapse is the awareness of a vaginal bulge or protrusion. For all
other pelvic symptoms, resolution with prolapse treatment cannot be assumed. (ACOG)

Assessment
• Severity of the symptoms and affect on QOL.
• Nature and extent of the prolapse needs to be assessed – the maximum degree of descent may
be observed on examination with the patient supine in heel stirrups, performing a Valsalva
maneuver. (ACOG)
• All pelvic floor defect assessment should be based on standard tools such as POP-Q.
• Assess occult urinary stress incontinence after reducing the prolapse with a pessary – prolapse
reduction stress test. Currently there is no consensus on how to best reduce prolapse for SUI
testing.
• Assess efficiency of bladder emptying – by assessing post-void residual urine volume.
• Baden–Walker system or POP-Q system – POP-Q system may be more detailed than necessary
for clinical practice and may be better suited for clinical research purposes.

Baden–Walker system for evaluation of prolapse
Grade 0 – normal position.
Grade 1 – descent halfway to the hymen.
Grade 2 – descent to the hymen.
Grade 3 – descent halfway past the hymen.
Grade 4 – maximum possible descent/procidentia.

http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/CBO9781316156513.026

Management
Depends on: the stage of the prolapse, severity of symptoms, age, general health of the patient,
and desire for future childbearing.

Non-surgical management

Expectant

Pelvic floor muscle training

Pessaries

• If asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic prolapse.
Symptom-directed therapy

• Weight loss if overweight.
• Avoid standing for long periods of time.
• Defaecatory problems – behavioural training, dietary
modification (high-fibre diet), and laxatives to
prevent constipation and straining.
Hormone replacement therapy (HRT)

• There is no evidence to support the use of oestrogen
replacement to prevent or treat prolapse.

• Indicated in pregnant women, physically frail women, those unfit for
surgery, or when surgery is declined.
• Change every 6–8 months to prevent ulceration of the vaginal vault. If
left for a long period, there is a risk of calcium deposition, erosion, and
fistula formation.
• Various shapes and sizes. Supportive (ring) or space-occupying (donut
pessary).
• Shelf pessaries preclude sexual intercourse and are therefore suitable for
women who are not sexually active.
• Ring pessaries tend to fail in women with deficient perineum, who may
require shelf pessaries instead.
• Side effects – vaginal discharge, irritation, bleeding.
• Pessarie scan be fitted in most women with prolapse, regardless of
prolapse stage or site. (ACOG)

PFMT may improve pelvic function and is recommended as an adjunct therapy for women with prolapse and
associated symptoms.

Evidence round-up
Cochrane review (2013) – pessaries (mechanical devices) for pelvic organ prolapse in women found only one RCT
­comparing ring and Gellhorn pessaries. Both pessaries are effective in 60% of women, with no differences between the
two types of pessary.
Cochrane review (2011) – PFMT improves in prolapse stage by 17% compared to no PFMT. There is some evidence indicating a positive effect of PFMT for prolapse symptoms and severity; 6 months of supervised PFMT has anatomical and
symptom improvement.
Cochrane reviews (2010) – oestrogen – use of local oestrogen in conjunction with PFMT before surgery may reduce ­the
incidence of postoperative cystitis within 4 weeks after surgery.

SECTION 5

U rogynaecology, pelvic floor problems, and hormone replacement therapy

Surgical management

Posterior vaginal prolapse/rectocele

Anterior vaginal prolapse/cystocele

• Anterior colporrhaphy with or without mesh/graft material.
• Paravaginal repair – vaginally or retropubically (open/laparoscopic).
Studies comparing the above approaches are lacking.
• Retrospective case series – recurrence rate of 15–37%.
• Cochrane review (2010):
* Standard anterior repair is associated with more recurrent cystoceles than with a
polyglactin mesh or porcine dermis mesh inlay, polypropylene mesh overlay, or armed
transobturator mesh; but data on morbidity and other clinical outcomes are lacking.
* No differences in subjective outcomes, QOL data, de novo dyspareunia, stress
incontinence, re-operation rates for prolapse, or incontinence.
* Blood loss with transobturator meshes was significantly higher than for native tissue
anterior repair.
* Mesh erosions – 10% of anterior repairs with polypropylene mesh.

• Posterior colporrhaphy with or without mesh/graft material.
• Site-specific repair – a specific defect in the vaginal muscularis or adventitia is repaired.
• Levator myorraphy (plication of the medial portion of levator ani) – insufficient evidence to
judge the value of levatormyorraphy during vaginal repair. Its use has been largely abandoned
because of dyspareunia except when postoperative sexual activity is not anticipated. (ACOG)
• Sacral colpoperineopexy – performed in conjuction with sacral colpopexy, where a mesh is
placed along the posterior vagina, all the way to perineal body (open/laparoscopic). Main
complication is dyspareunia.
• Transanal approach with plication of redundant rectal mucosa and anterior rectal muscle.
Transvaginal repair was more effective for subjective symptom relief and recurrence of
prolapse.
• Cochrane review (2010) – vaginal approach was associated with a lower rate of recurrent
rectocele, or enterocele, or both, than the transanal approach, although there was a higher
blood loss and postoperative narcotic use. No data on efficacy of polypropylene mesh in the
posterior vaginal compartment.

Apical prolapse
Abdominal/laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy (ASC)
Vaginal sacrospinous fixation/colpopexy (SSF)
Vaginal uterosacral ligament suspension
Iliococcygeus fixation
Sling procedures/hysteropexy
Colpocleisis

• See Chapter 26.
•	Hysterectomy – the traditional surgical approach. However, hysterectomy alone or hysterectomy with anterior or posterior colporrhaphy does
not address the underlying problem of deficient apical support. When hysterectomy is performed for prolapse, apical support should be restored.
• Cochrane review (2010) – surgical management of pelvic organ prolapse – ASC is better than vaginal SSF in terms of a lower rate of recurrent
vault prolapse (RR 0.23) and less dyspareunia (RR 0.39). However, there is no difference in re-operation rates for prolapse. The vaginal SSF is
quicker and cheaper to perform and associated with quicker recovery.
• Whether the results are superior with uterosacral vs SSF is unknown as these procedures have not been compared in RCTs.

What can be done

What can be done
Young women with childbearing potential or women who prefer to avoid hysterectomy

Vaginal suspension procedures:
• Utero-scaral or SSF; ASC.
Hysteropexy/sling procedures:
• Sacral hysteropexy (abdominal/laparoscopic attachment of lower uterus to sacral promontory
with synthetic mesh); sacrospinous hysteropexy. Prolapse recurrence – 7–30%.
• Hysteropexy should not be performed by using the ventral abdominal wall for support
because of the high risk of recurrent prolapse, mainly enterocele.
Round ligament suspension:
• It is not effective in treating uterine prolapse.
Future pregnancy:
• Limited data on pregnancy outcome.
• Ideally, childbearing should be completed before considering surgery for prolapse to avoid
the theoretical risk of recurrence after subsequent pregnancy and delivery.
• For women who become pregnant after prolapse repair, decision regarding mode of delivery
should be made on case-to-case basis.

To anticipate or prevent occurrence of urinary stress incontinence after surgery
for uterovaginal prolapse

• Many women with severe degree of prolapse (particularly with cystocele) will not have
symptoms of USI because:
* Sphincter mechanism is intact.
* Prolapse kinks the urethra, masking the USI.
Therefore, some of these urinary continent women will become incontinent following surgery
(occult USI).
• Investigation – prolapse reduction stress test – women with positive test more frequently have
USI following prolapse repair compared with negative test.
• Postoperative USI is significantly reduced with the addition of anti-continence procedure
along with the prolapse surgery in women with positive prolapse reduction stress test. The
TVT mid-urethral sling rather than sub-urethral fascial plication offers better prevention
from postoperative USI. However, this prophylaxis against postoperative USI is not perfectly
effective as some women continue to have urinary incontinence, both stress and urge
incontinence, after the surgery.
• Cochrane review (2012) – continence surgery at the time of prolapse surgery in continent
women does not significantly reduce the rate of postoperative SUI.

Use of mesh in prolapse repair surgery
NICE

• Surgical repair of vaginal wall prolapse using mesh may be more efficacious than traditional surgical repair without mesh. Both efficacy and
safety vary with different types of mesh, and the data on efficacy in the long term are limited. There is a risk of complications that can cause
significant morbidity.
• Insertion of mesh uterine suspension sling (including sacrohysteropexy), infracoccygeal sacropexy using mesh – current evidence on the safety
and efficacy is inadequate.
• Therefore, the above procedures should only be used with special arrangements for clinical governance, consent, and audit or research.
ACOG

• Based on currently available limited data, although many patients undergoing mesh augmented vaginal repairs heal well without problems,
there seems to be a small but significant group of patients who experience permanent life altering sequelae including pain and dyspareunia.
• Range of mesh-related complications available from RCTs – mesh erosions 5–19%; buttock, groin, pelvic pain 0–10%; de novo dyspareunia
8–28%; re-operation (excluding operation of USI) 3–22%.
• Pelvic organ prolapse: mesh repair should be reserved for high-risk individuals in whom the benefit of mesh replacement may justify the risk,
such as individuals with recurrent prolapse (particularly of anterior compartment) or with medical co-morbidities that preclude more invasive
lengthier open and endoscopic procedures.

CHAPTER 26 Vault prolapse

Prevention at the time of hysterectomy
Background and prevalence
• Definition – descent of the vaginal cuff scar below a point that is 2 cm less than the total
vaginal length above the plane of the hymen.
• Incidence – follows 12% of hysterectomies performed for prolapse and 2% of those
performed for other indications.

Assessment
•
•
•
•

• McCall culdoplasty at the time of vaginal hysterectomy to prevent enterocoele formation.
It involves approximating the uterosacral ligaments using continuous sutures, to
obliterate the peritoneum of the posterior cul-de-sac as high as possible. It is more
effective than vaginal Moschowitz or simple closure of the peritoneum in preventing
enterocele.
• Attaching the uterosacral and cardinal ligaments to the vaginal cuff and high
circumferential obliteration of the pouch of Douglas at the time of hysterectomy to
prevent vault prolapse and enterocele formation.
• Prophylactic sacrospinous fixation (SSF) at the time of vaginal hysterectomy is
recommended when the vault (point C on the POP-Q system) descends to the introitus
during closure.

Symptoms – pressure and discomfort; effect on urinary, bowel and sexual function.
Can affect QOL.
Assess all pelvic floor defects on standard tools such as POP-Q.
Assess occult stress incontinence of urine after reducing the prolapse with a pessary.

Management

Surgical management

Non-surgical management
• Pessaries – require change every 6–8 months to prevent ulceration of the vaginal vault. If left for a long period, there
is a risk of calcium deposition, erosion, and fistula formation. Therefore, they are reserved for physically frail women,
those considered unfit for surgery, or when surgery is declined.
• Shelf pessaries preclude sexual intercourse and, therefore, are more suitable for women who are not sexually active.
• Ring pessaries tend to fail in women with deficient perineum, who may require shelf pessaries instead.
• Pelvic-floor exercises – no evidence to suggest that pelvic-floor exercises are helpful in vault prolapse.

Surgical management

Vaginal wall repair

Vaginal uterosacral ligament suspension

Vaginal sacrospinous fixation

• Anterior and posterior repair along with
obliteration of the enterocele sac is inadequate.
It does not support the vaginal vault and
risks vaginal narrowing and shortening and
dyspareunia, especially with posterior repair.
• Levator myorraphy – there is insufficient evidence
to judge the value of levator myorraphy during
vaginal repair.

• Although it is effective for vault prolapse,
caution is advised. Complications included
ureteric injury (11%), bladder injury, UTI, blood
transfusion, small bowel injury, and suture
erosion.
• A re-operation rate of 5% and patient
dissatisfaction rate of 11% have been reported.

• Compared to ASC – there is no difference in objective and subjective success;
urinary, bowel, sexual dysfunction or QOL. SSF may have a higher failure
rate, higher rate of apical and anterior vaginal wall prolapse, but has lower
postoperative morbidity.
• Complications (rare) – blood transfusion, bladder injury, rectovaginal
haematoma, vaginal pain.
• It requires adequate vaginal length and vault width to enable reaching the
sacrospinous ligament.
• Coexistent anterior and/or posterior vaginal wall prolapse can easily be
managed by anterior and/or posterior repair.
• There is no evidence to recommend bilateral or unilateral SSF.

Abdominal sacrocolpopexy

• Mesh is attached to the apex of the vagina and may also be attached to the anterior and/or
posterior vaginal wall, with the aim of preventing future vaginal vault prolapse.
• As compared to SSF – longer operating time, slower return to normal activity, higher cost,
increased number of posterior vaginal wall prolapses, less dyspareunia, and a lower rate of
recurrence.
• Complications (rare) – blood transfusion, bladder injury, incisional hernia, mesh rejection,
wound infection.
• Separate vaginal procedure will be required, although the sacrocolpopexy mesh can be
extended in front of and/or behind the vagina to effect anterior and/or posterior vaginal
repair.
• Can be carried out if women require laparotomy for other indications.
• Is more suitable for sexually active women, as SSF is associated with exaggerated retroversion
of the vagina, leading to a less physiological axis than that following ASC.
• Vaginal length is well maintained whereas SSF can cause vaginal narrowing and/or
shortening, especially when carried out alongside repair of anterior and/or posterior vaginal
wall defects, leading to dyspareunia.

Laparoscopic approach

• Laparoscopic – sacrocolpopexy, SSF, and uterosacral ligament suspension.
• Advantages – enhanced view of the pelvis which facilitates a more anatomical repair and less
scarring, reduced postoperative morbidity, and shorter hospital stay.
• It requires skill, training, and longer operating time.
• Laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy appears to be as effective as ASC.
• Complications – injury to bladder and bowel, wound haematoma, and UTI. Conversion to
laparotomy can be up to 8% but drops with experience to <1%.
• Laparoscopic uterosacral ligament suspension entails reattachment of the uterosacral
ligaments to the vaginal vault. Success rates over 90%. There is a risk of ureteric injury, and
cystoscopy is advised after suture placement to detect such injury. Sutures can be cut and
replaced if the ureters are kinked or obstructed.

Surgical management (contd.)

Iliococcygeus fixation

Infracoccygeal sacropexy with mesh

Sling procedures

• Involves bilateral fixation of the vaginal vault to the
iliococcygeus fascia.
• Reduces the exaggerated retroversion of the vagina, and
thus the subsequent increase in anterior vaginal wall
prolapse, and avoids the risk of injury to pudendal and
sacral nerves and vessels associated with SSF.
• No significant difference in postoperative complications
or subsequent development of anterior vaginal wall
prolapse compared to vaginal SSF; therefore, is not
routinely recommended.

• An incision is made in the posterior wall of the vagina
and a small puncture incision is made in each buttock. A
tape (mesh) is introduced through one buttock and, using
a tunnelling device, the tape is passed around the rectum.
The tape is then passed up the side of the vagina, across
the top, and down the other side, and out through the
incision in the other buttock. The tape is sutured to the
top of the vagina to act as a tension-free sling that aims to
suspend the vault.
• Limited evidence – uncertainty about the procedure’s
safety, including mesh erosion and the risk of recurrence.
• Failure rate 9–10%. Symptomatic relief is reported in 85%.
• Complications – mesh erosion, infection, rectal perforation.

• Uterine suspension sling using mesh involves attaching the
uterus (or cervix) either to the sacrum (sacrohysteropexy)
or to the ileopectineal ligaments.
• The mesh can be attached to the uterus either in the
midline of the posterior cervix or bilaterally, where the
uterosacral ligaments join the uterus; or to the front of the
cervix and to the ileopectineal ligaments.
• Can also be used for women with cervical prolapse after
supracervical hysterectomy.
• Significantly longer operating times and more blood loss
compared to SSF.
• Complications – mesh erosion, infection, rectal perforation,
bleeding, incisional hernia, small bowel obstruction.

Total mesh reconstruction

Vault suspension to the anterior abdominal wall

• A number of techniques, where a sheet of synthetic mesh material is fixed at a
number of points to act as a new pelvic floor (‘total mesh’).
• Insufficient evidence to judge the safety and effectiveness.
• Complications – mesh erosion and infection.
• Data on long-term effectiveness are limited.

• Simple measure; however, data are limited.
• Techniques include suspending the vaginal vault to anterior rectus sheath, to pectineal (Cooper’s)
ligament; plus the use of a rectus sheath fascial sling, using a transverse or a midline incision or an
abdominovaginal approach.
• Minimal operative complications.
• Failure rate of 10%.
• Main concern – unphysiological axis of the vagina.

Colpocleisis

• Safe and effective procedure.
• It entails closure of the vagina, which is suitable for frail women who
do not want to retain sexual function.
• Short operating time and low incidence of complications.
• Success rates of 97% and above.
• Can also be performed under local anaesthesia.

CHAPTER 27 Menopause and hormone replacement therapy

Background and prevalence

Risks or complications

• Menopause – when menstruation ceases permanently owing to the loss of ovarian follicular
activity. It is diagnosed with certainty after 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhoea.
• The average age of menopause is 52 years.
• Peri-menopause is the period before the menopause when the endocrinological, biological,
and clinical features of approaching menopause commence because of decreasing oestrogen
levels.
• Premature ovarian insufficiency (POI) is menopause that occurs at an age less than two
standard deviations below the mean established for the reference population. In practice, in
developed countries, 45 years of age is the cut-off point.
• About 80% of women in the UK experience menopausal symptoms and 45% find the
symptoms distressing.
• Hot flushes occur in 70–80% of peri-menopausal women. They are most common in the first
year after the final menstrual period.
• Vaginal symptoms occur in about 30% of women during the early post-menopausal period
and in up to 47% of women during the later post-menopausal period.
• Only 10% seek medical advice.
• Racial, cultural, religious, sociological, and nutritional factors modify the quality and
incidence of menopausal symptoms.

• Can affect QOL. Without treatment menopausal symptoms are usually self-limiting
(2–5 years), although some women experience symptoms for many years. Hot flushes are
usually present for less than 5 years; however, some women may continue to flush beyond the
age of 60 years.
• Vaginal symptoms, including dryness, discomfort, itching, and dyspareunia, generally persist
or worsen with ageing.
• Risk of chronic disease:
* Risk of osteoporosis, urogenital atrophy, cardiovascular disease, and stroke all increase
after the menopause.
* It is unclear whether dementia is associated directly with decreased oestrogen levels.

Assessment at primary care
• Assess the stage of menopause – whether peri-menopausal, post-menopausal, or a POI.
• Assess the symptoms – hot flushes, night sweats, vaginal dryness; primary depression or
primary insomnia.
• Determine severity of the symptoms and the extent to which they are affecting the woman’s
QOL.
• Discuss woman’s expectations.
• Assess the risk of cardiovascular disease and of osteoporosis.
• Rule out any contraindications (history of breast cancer, VTE).
• Discuss the risks and benefits of HRT.
• Record BMI and BP.
• Breast examination is not routinely necessary; however, discuss the national mammography
screening programme and personal breast awareness before starting HRT.
• Pelvic examination is not routinely required unless clinically indicated.
• Investigations are not routinely indicated.
• Women who are not suitable for HRT or do not want to use HRT discuss alternatives to HRT.
• Encourage all women to participate in the national cervical screening programme.
• Discuss the perceived benefits and possible risks for their individual situations, including
consideration of alternative therapies.
• Discuss the risk of VTE and the signs and symptoms of VTE. Advise to access medical help
rapidly if they suspect that they have developed a thrombosis.

History – symptoms
• Menstrual cycle length may shorten to 2–3 weeks or lengthen to many months. The amount
of menstrual blood loss may change.
• Most common symptoms are hot flushes, night sweats, vaginal dryness, and sleep
disturbance.
• Hot flushes and night sweats – hot flushes arise as a sudden feeling of heat in the upper body
(face, neck, and chest) and spread upwards and downwards. Diffuse or patchy flushing of the
skin is followed by sweating and tachycardia/palpitations. Hot flushes generally last only a
few minutes.
• Sleep disturbance is often due to night sweats but may also be associated with mood
disorders or primary sleep disorders. Chronically disturbed sleep can lead to irritability and
to difficulties with short-term memory and concentration.
• Urinary and vaginal symptoms, such as vaginal discomfort and dryness, dyspareunia, and
recurrent lower urinary tract infection, are common in the menopause.

Contraindications to starting HRT
•
•
•
•

Hormone-dependent cancer (endometrial cancer, current or past breast cancer).
Active or recent arterial thromboembolic disease (angina or myocardial infarction).
VTE, PE. • Severe active liver disease.
Undiagnosed breast mass. • Uninvestigated abnormal vaginal bleeding.

http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/CBO9781316156513.028

Investigations
Do not offer routine investigations before starting HRT unless:
• Change in menstrual pattern, IMB, PCB, or PMB: consider an endometrial assessment.
• Personal or family history of VTE: consider a thrombophilia screen.
• High risk of breast cancer: mammography or MRI as appropriate for the woman’s age.
• Woman has arterial disease or other risk markers for arterial disease: a lipid profile
may be useful.

Routes and regimens
• Oestrogen – transdermal (gels or patches) and subcutaneous (implants) routes avoid the
first-pass effect through the liver and are not associated with an increased risk of VTE.
• Progestogen – vaginal route, e.g., levonorgestrel IUS and progesterone gel and pessaries,
provide adequate endometrial protection with reduced systemic side effects. Progesterone
is available in an oral micronized form, vaginal pessaries, and gel.
• Continuous combined regimens avoid the need for regular withdrawal bleeds but may
be associated with continuous low-grade progestogenic side effects. Ultra low-dose
oestradiol/progestogen continuous combined regimens appear to maintain the benefits of
higher-dose regimens while allowing minimal use of progestogen to reduce side effects.
• Low-dose vaginal oestrogenic creams, rings, tablets, and pessaries should be considered
for all women with symptoms of urogenital atrophy. Local oestrogenic preparations
may be more effective than systemic therapy and can be used in conjunction with
oral/transdermal HRT. Indefinite usage is usually required as symptoms often return
when treatment is discontinued. Progestogenic opposition is not required as systemic
absorption is minimal with oestradiol and oestriol preparations.
• Drospirenone, a spironolactone analogue, has anti-androgenic and anti-mineralocorticoid
properties. It has been incorporated with low-dose oestrogen in a continuous combined
formulation.
• With both cyclical and continuous regimens, there may be some erratic bleeding to begin
with, but 90% of these women will eventually be completely bleed free.

139

• Do not routinely measure FSH levels for diagnosing the menopause. The diagnosis is clinical.
Measurement of LH, oestradiol, progesterone, or testosterone is of no value.
• Measurement of FSH is of limited value as:
* FSH levels fluctuate during the peri-menopause.
* Normal results do not exclude the menopause.
* An increased concentration is suggestive of ovarian failure but does not indicate an inability to
conceive.
• Measurement of FSH may be useful in (≥ 2 occasions at least 1–2 months apart):
* Women < 45 years of age with suspected POI.
* Women who have had a hysterectomy with ovarian conservation before 40 years of age.
* Women using hormonal contraception. As the COC suppresses gonadotrophins, a low level
may be impossible to interpret. Measure FSH when the woman is not taking oestrogen-based
contraception either by stopping the COC or by changing to a progesterone only preparation.
Allow 6 weeks between terminating therapy and measuring FSH.

Progestonic side effects
Non-hysterectomized women require 12–14 days of progestogen to avoid endometrial hyperplasia and
minimize the risk of endometrial cancer with unopposed oestrogen.
• One of the main factors for reduced compliance with HRT is that of progestogen intolerance.
• Progestogens – symptoms of fluid retention are produced by the sodium-retaining effect of the
renin–aldosterone system, triggered by stimulation of the aldosterone receptors.
• Androgenic side effects such as acne and hirsuitism are a problem of the testosterone-derived
progestogens owing to stimulation of the androgen receptors.
• Mood swings and PMS-like side effects result from adverse stimulation of the central nervous
system progesterone receptors.
• Dose can be halved and duration of progestogen can be reduced to 7–10 days to minimize
progestogenic side effects. This may result in bleeding problems and hyperplasia, so keep a low
threshold for ultrasound scanning and endometrial sampling if clinically indicated.
• Progesterone and dydrogesterone generally have fewer side effects.
• Progestogenic side effects may be reduced by transvaginal pessaries or gels and LNG-IUS.
LNG-IUS provides adequate endometrial protection in women receiving oestrogen therapy.
Systemic side effects are reduced, although not completely eliminated. The impact on breast cancer
risk remains unclear with preliminary data showing no significant difference when compared to
systemic progestogens.

SECTION 5

U rogynaecology, pelvic floor problems, and hormone replacement therapy

Benefits of HRT – immediate effects of HRT

Vasomotor symptoms – oestrogen remains the most effective
treatment. Decide the optimum dose and duration according to
the severity of symptoms and response to therapy.
Mood – short-term use of HRT may improve mood and
­depressive symptoms during the menopausal transition and in
the ­early menopause. Women with severe depression and those
who do not respond to HRT will require psychiatric assessment.
Sexual function – HRT, systemic or topical, may improve
sexual function in women with dyspareunia secondary to
vaginal atrophy, through its proliferative effect on the vulval
and vaginal epithelium and by improving vaginal lubrication.
Systemic testosterones result in significant improvement in
sexual function, including sexual desire, and orgasm.

Urogenital symptoms – oestrogen has a proliferative effect
on the bladder and urethral epithelium and may help relieve
symptoms of urinary frequency, urgency, and possibly reduce
the risk of recurrent UTIs in women with urogenital atrophy.
Low-dose vaginal oestrogen preparations can be used longterm in symptomatic women as required, and all topical
oestrogen preparations are effective. There is no requirement
to combine this with systemic progestogen treatment for endometrial protection, as low-dose vaginal oestrogen preparations
do not result in significant systemic absorption. However, there
is little evidence to prove the safety of vaginal preparations
beyond one year of use; therefore, clinicians should aim to use
the lowest effective dose for symptom control.

Musculoskeletal effects – oestrogen deficiency after the menopause has a negative effect on connective tissue metabolism
in the bone matrix, skin, intervertebral discs, and elsewhere
in the body. Oestrogen therapy has a protective effect against
connective tissue loss and may possibly reverse this process in
menopausal women receiving HRT.
Colorectal cancer – reduced risk of colorectal cancer with the
use of oral combined HRT.
WHI – colorectal cancer risk was reduced in women taking
combined conjugated equine oestrogens (CEE) and MPA, but
there was no effect of CEE-only therapy.
There are no data on the effect of transdermal HRT and risk
of colorectal cancer.

Long-term effects of HRT

Osteoporosis

Cardiovascular

Cognition

• HRT is effective in preserving bone density and preventing
osteoporosis in both spine and hip, as well as reducing the
risk of osteoporosis-related fractures. • HRT is the first-line
therapeutic intervention for the prevention and treatment of
osteoporosis in women with POI and menopausal women
< 60 years, particularly those with menopausal symptoms.
• Initiating HRT after the age of 60 years for the sole
purpose of the prevention of osteoporotic fractures is not
recommended.
• The bone-protective effect of oestrogen is dose related. The
bone-preserving effect of HRT on bone mineral density
declines after discontinuation of treatment.
• Use of HRT for a few years around the menopause may
provide a long-term protective effect many years after
stopping HRT.

• Early cohort studies suggested that HRT is associated with
a significant reduction in the incidence of heart disease,
whether oestrogen alone or combined with progestogen.
• WHI – women using CEE 0.625 mg alone or with MPA
2.5mg had a small increase in incidence of coronary heart
disease in the first 12 months.
• ‘Early harm’ can occur when therapy is commenced in
women > 60 years of age with relative overdoses of oral
oestrogen. When prescribing HRT for the first time in
women over the age of 60 years, use the lowest effective
dose.
• RCT data from the Danish Osteoporosis Trial have shown
that hormone therapy reduces the incidence of coronary
heart disease by around 50% if commenced within 10 years
of the menopause – this is referred to as the ‘window of
opportunity’ for primary prevention.

• Observational data show an improvement in cognitive
function with HRT started in early menopause and a
possible reduction in the long-term risk of Alzheimer’s
disease and all causes of dementia. Further evidence is
needed to confirm this.
• Other studies, including the WHI, showed no significant
improvement in memory or cognitive function with HRT in
older post-menopausal women, with a reported increase in
the risk of dementia in women aged 65–79 years.
• Do not initiate HRT for the sole purpose of improving
cognitive function or reducing the risk of dementia in postmenopausal women.

Risks of HRT

Breast cancer

Endometrial cancer

Ovarian cancer – conflicting data.

• WHI – oestrogen and progesterone has a small increase in risk of breast
cancer after 5 years of use of approximately one extra case per 1000
women per annum.
• WHI – oestrogen alone has a small but statistically significant decrease in
risk.
• The Million Women Study (MWS) raised concerns over the long-term
safety of HRT from the perspective of breast cancer.
• The data from these trials are too limited to establish a causal association
between HRT and breast cancer.
• Combined HRT has been associated with the highest risk.
• Risk is lower with oestrogen-only HRT than with combined HRT.
• Risk increases with duration of use and returns to baseline within 5 years
of stopping treatment.

• Unopposed oestrogen therapy increases
the incidence of endometrial cancer;
largely avoided by the use of combined
sequential oestrogen/progestogen therapy.
• Long-term use of sequential combined
HRT for > 5 years may be associated with
a small increase in risk of endometrial
cancer. Continuous combined regimens
are associated with a significantly lower
risk of endometrial cancer than an
untreated population.

• Several case–control studies reported a significant increase in
risk associated with the use of oestrogen replacement therapy
and either a smaller or no increased risk with combined
oestrogen and progestogen therapy.
• WHI reported no increased risk.
• Recent data from the Danish National Cancer Registry
showed a small but significant increase in the incidence of
ovarian cancer following 8 years’ use of unopposed oestrogen
and oestrogen/progestogen therapy.
• Long-term use of oestrogen-only or combined HRT may be
associated with a small increased risk of ovarian cancer. This
risk returns to baseline a few years after stopping treatment.

Venous thromboembolism

Stroke

• Oral HRT increases the risk of VTE 2–4 fold, with the highest risk in the first year of use. The
absolute risk, particularly in the absence of other risk factors, remains low. VTE incidence rate is
4.2/1000 patient–years in women who are never exposed to HRT, compared to 5.8/1000 patient–
years in women of a similar age exposed to combination HRT with conjugated oestrogen.
• VTE risk is further increased if there is a personal or family history of VTE or other risk factors.
• Oestrogen-type – risk of VTE may be less with esterified oestrogens compared with CEE; there is
still a significant VTE risk with both types of oestrogen.
• Combination HRT – there may be a greater risk of VTE with combination therapy. However, HRT
with oestrogen alone is also associated with a significant VTE risk.
• Progestogen type – micronized progesterone and pregnane derivatives may carry a lower
thrombotic risk compared with norpregnane derivatives and MPA.
• Oestrogen dose – the effect of oestrogen may be dose related. With no significant VTE risk
associated with doses of oral oestrogen of around 0.3 mg; a higher VTE risk with oestrogen doses
of ≈ 1.25 mg or more (ORs 2.4–6.9) compared with 0.625 mg (ORs 1.7–4.3).
• Transdermal preparations are associated with a substantially lower risk of VTE than oral
preparations. A systematic review revealed a nonsignificant OR of VTE in association with
transdermal oestrogen of 1.2 (95% CI 0.9–1.7).
• Duration of therapy – risk of VTE is highest in the first year of HRT use, with no evidence of
continuing risk on stopping HRT.
• Past use of HRT – there is no significant pooled VTE risk with those who had used oral oestrogen
HRT in the past.

• Conflicting data.
• WHI – increased incidence of stoke in women using oestrogen and
progestogen therapy or oestrogen alone; a smaller increase in incidence of
stroke in women who commenced HRT between the ages of 50 and 59 years.
• HERS study – no increased risk of stroke with HRT.
• HRT is not recommended for the primary or secondary prevention of stroke.
• Oestrogen-only and combined HRT increased the risk of stroke (mostly
ischaemic).
• Although the increase in relative risk seems to be similar irrespective of age,
baseline risk of stroke increases with age and therefore older women have a
greater absolute risk.
• Be cautious when prescribing HRT in women > 60 years, particularly when
they have a risk factor for stroke or VTE. In these groups, transdermal route
may be advantageous. The effects of HRT may be dose related; prescribe the
lowest effective dose in women with significant risk factors.

SECTION 5

VTE – history and assessment of risk factors (RCOG)
Family history of VTE – heritable thrombophilia

Personal/previous history of VTE

• Combination of HRT and one prothrombotic mutation gives a combined OR of 8.0 for VTE
compared with women without exposure to either risk factor. Asymptomatic carriers of FVL
mutation – incidence of VTE related to HRT is 3%/year.
• Do not offer universal screening for thrombophilic defects before prescribing HRT. Screening of
795 women would be required to prevent one episode of VTE in 5 years. Screening selected women
is the most cost-effective method.
• A history of VTE in a first-degree relative is a relative contraindication to HRT. Discuss alternatives
to HRT or consider transdermal preparations. Given the polygenic nature of VTE, the risk of
VTE may still be increased in those members of the family who do not carry that thrombophilia.
Consequently, a negative thrombophilia result does not necessarily exclude an increased risk.
• If a heritable thrombophilia is detected in an affected family member testing for thrombophilia
does not provide a definitive estimate of risk in most cases; therefore, do not offer routinely.
However, where a high-risk heritable thrombophilia is identified in a symptomatic family member
(e.g., deficiency of anti-thrombin, protein C, or protein S) testing for thrombophilia may assist in
the counselling of overall thrombotic risk.
• In women without a personal history of VTE but with a high-risk thrombophilic trait (deficiency of
anti-thrombin, protein C or protein S, or combination of defects) that has been identified through
screening because of a symptomatic family member, avoid oral HRT and seek specialist advice.
• With other thrombophilic defects, there is insufficient evidence at present to indicate that HRT
should be completely avoided. In the presence of multiple-risk factors for VTE, avoid HRT.

• A personal history of thrombosis is a contraindication to oral HRT.
• Oral combined HRT has a 4–5-fold higher risk of recurrent VTE.
• If QOL is so severely affected that the benefits of HRT outweigh the risks:
* Use a transdermal preparation.
* Discuss the risk of recurrence.
* Consider prophylactic anticoagulant therapy while the woman is taking HRT.
However, it has risk of major haemorrhage at around 1% per year of treatment
and 25% of these bleeds are fatal.
* Seek specialist advice.
• Testing for thrombophilia in selected women (e.g., those with previous severe
unprovoked or recurrent VTE indicating a severe defect such as deficiency of antithrombin, protein C, or protein S) may be helpful in assessing the overall thrombotic
risk in women with a personal history of VTE; however, the result will not alter the
advice that oral HRT should be avoided.
• Do not routinely offer testing for thrombophilia in unselected women who have
experienced a first episode of VTE, as there is insufficient evidence that testing
reduces the risk of recurrence, or that the results should influence the duration of
anticoagulant therapy.

Other risk factors

• Avoid HRT in women with multiple pre-existing risk factors for VTE. Additional risk factors:
* Increasing age. * Obesity (BMI > 30). * Post-thrombotic syndrome.
* Varicose veins with phlebitis. * Immobility for > 3 days.
* Surgical procedures (anaesthesia and surgical time > 60 minutes).
* Other disorders, e.g., malignancy, myeloproliferative disorders, cardiac disease, paralysis of lower limbs,
systemic infection, inflammatory bowel disease, nephritic syndrome, sickle cell disease.
• Age – compared with women aged 50–59 years, those aged 60–69 years had a doubling of risk, and those
aged 70–79 years had an almost 4-fold increase in risk.
• Obesity – increased risk of VTE associated with increasing weight. OR of 2.7 associated with BMI 25
to < 30 and an OR of 4.0 with BMI > 30 kg/m2. The use of transdermal HRT does not increase the risk
associated with weight.

• Assess risk of VTE prior to commencing HRT. Routine
thrombophilia testing is not required, but consider if there
is a family history of thrombosis.
• In ‘high-risk’ individuals who require HRT, use
transdermal preparations, and if a progestogen is
required, suitable options are micronized progesterone or
dydrogesterone.
• Review and provide thromboprophylaxis if a woman on
HRT is hospitalized.

Management

Women with intact uterus

• Peri-menopausal women
• If the LMP was < 1 year, start a sequential
combined regimen, i.e., continuous oestrogen
with progestogen for 12–14 days per month.
• Combined oestrogen and progestogen cyclical
preparation, as it gives predictable withdrawal
bleeding, whereas continuous regimens often
cause unpredictable bleeding.
• Consider switching from cyclical therapy to
continuous combined therapy when the woman
is considered to be post-menopausal.

Women who have had a hysterectomy

Urogenital symptoms alone

• Oral or transdermal oestrogen
replacement

• Low-dose vaginal oestrogen (cream,
pessary, tablet, or ring)

Post-menopausal women

• After a minimum of one year of HRT, or one year after the LMP (2 years in POI), women
who wish to avoid a monthly withdrawal bleed, switch to a continuous combined regimen.
If breakthrough bleeding occurs following the switch to continuous combined HRT and does
not settle after 3–6 months, then the woman can be switched back to a sequential regimen
for at least another year.
• Cyclical HRT may be used; however, continuous combined preparations are generally
preferred because they do not induce bleeding.
• If the woman requires treatment for decreased libido, consider tibolone. Tibolone is effective
for treating VMS and improving sexual functioning.

If bleeding is heavy or erratic on
a sequential regimen, the dose of
progestogen can be doubled or
duration increased to 21 days.
Persistent bleeding problems > 6
months warrant investigation with
USS and/or endometrial biopsy.

Follow-up
• Review at 3 months and once each year thereafter.
• An initial review at 3 months, as most menopausal symptoms respond by then VMS
improvement is usually noted within 4 weeks. At the initial 3-month review:
* Assess the effectiveness of treatment and adjust to achieve symptom relief.
* Enquire about any bleeding patterns, adverse effects and manage appropriately.
* Check blood pressure and body weight.
• Annual review because the risks and benefits of HRT change over time and need to be
discussed regularly.
* Check effectiveness of treatment and adverse effects and manage appropriately.
* Interrupt treatment with intravaginal oestrogen and consider stopping systemic
HRT to re-assess the need for continued use.
* Perform a breast examination if indicated by personal or family history. Encourage
breast awareness and participation in the national breast screening programme.
* Pelvic examination only if clinically indicated; check blood pressure.

When to stop HRT

• If HRT is being used for symptom control consider a trial withdrawal (if a woman is
symptom-free) after 1–2 years.
• Symptoms may recur for a short time once HRT is stopped.
• Topical oestrogen may be required long term as symptoms can recur once treatment
is stopped.
• Stop treatment at least annually to re-assess the need for continued treatment.

143

Refer women if:

• There is multiple treatment failure.
• Pattern of withdrawal bleeding or breakthrough bleeding changes while
taking monthly cyclical therapy.
• There is breakthrough bleeding that persists for more than 4–6 months or
does not lessen while taking a 3-monthly regimen.

Poor symptom control

• Review the woman and her expectations.
• Check that the HRT has been used for at least 3 months to ensure full
effect.
• Check that patches are adherent.
• Consider an alternative diagnosis.
• Treatment options include increasing the oestrogen dose.
• Adding vaginal oestrogen if urogenital symptoms are not controlled.
• Switching from oral to a non-oral route (e.g., if absorption is poor because
of a bowel disorder or if a drug interaction is present).
• Switching delivery system if patch adhesion is poor.

SECTION 5

U rogynaecology, pelvic floor problems, and hormone replacement therapy

Alternatives to HRT for the management of symptoms of the menopause (RCOG)
Lifestyle measures

Non-pharmacological agents for vaginal dryness

• Aerobic exercise – limited evidence. Can improve psychological health, QOL, and can result in significant
improvements in vasomotor symptoms and other menopause-related symptoms (e.g., mood and insomnia).
Low-intensity exercise such as yoga may be beneficial. The best activity appears to be regular sustained
aerobic exercise such as swimming or running.
• Hot flushes and night sweats – take regular exercise, wear lighter clothing, sleep in a cooler room, and
reduce stress. Avoid possible triggers, such as spicy foods, caffeine, smoking, and alcohol. Smoking
cigarettes and having a BMI > 30 kg/m2 increases the likelihood of flushing.
• Sleep disturbances – avoiding exercise late in the day and maintaining a regular bedtime.
• Mood and anxiety disturbances – adequate sleep, regular physical activity, and relaxation exercises.
• Cognitive symptoms – exercise and good sleep hygiene may improve subjective cognitive symptoms.

• Lubricants and vaginal moisturizers (Replens and Sylk) –
limited evidence.
• Lubricants – a combination of protectants and thickening
agents in a water-soluble base used to relieve vaginal
dryness during intercourse.
• Moisturizers may contain a bioadhesive polycarbophilbased polymer that attaches to mucin and epithelial
cells on the vaginal wall and retains water. May provide
longer-term relief of vaginal dryness.

Pharmacological alternatives

Progestogens

Clonidine

Selective serotonin and noradrenaline

• Megestrol acetate has benefit for VMS
over placebo.
• WHI – safety of progestogens is
questionable, as the increase in risk of
breast cancer with HRT is due to the
combination of oestrogen and progestogen
(rather than oestrogen alone). Therefore,
it is inappropriate to treat women who
are at increased risk of breast cancer with
progestogens, particularly women with
progesterone-receptor-positive tumours.
• Doses of progestogens that achieve VMS
control can increase the risk of VTE.

• Centrally active α2 agonist.
• The trial data are contradictory.
• Oral/ transdermal – by avoiding
first-pass metabolism, will
increase efficacy.
• A systematic review – marginally
significant benefit over placebo;
however, the effects of clonidine
are not as great as those of
oestrogen, and adverse effects
may restrict its use.

reuptake inhibitors

• SSRIs (fluoxetine and paroxetine) – study
on citalopram and fluoxetine showed no
benefit.
• SNRIs – most convincing data are for
venlafaxine (37.5 mg BD).
• High incidence of nausea, reduced libido
and sexual response.
• Analogue of venlafaxine (desvenlafaxine
succinate) – symptom relief can be
maintained while adverse effects are
reduced.
• Further research is required.

• β-blockers – trials have been
disappointing.
• Gabapentin – showed efficacy for hot
flush reduction compared with placebo,
but oestrogen is more effective.
• Adverse effect profile (drowsiness,
dizziness, fatigue) may restrict use.
• Dehydroepiandrosterone – a pilot study
showed a modest reduction in hot flushes.

Diet and supplements

Homeopathy

Stellate ganglion blockade

• Vitamins such as E and C, and minerals such as
selenium are present in various supplements. The
evidence that they are of any benefit is limited.
• Vitamin E – a statistically significant reduction in hot
flush frequency is reported with vitamin E 800 IU/day
compared with placebo; however, this reduction was
only small and might not be clinically significant.

• Mechanisms that underlie the biological response to
ultra-molecular dilutions are unclear.
• Data from case histories, observational studies, and a
small number of randomized trials are encouraging,
but more research is needed.

• Local anaesthetic injection into the stellate ganglion.
Recently emerged as a new technique against hot
flushes and sweating refractory to other treatments or
where HRT is contraindicated.
• Preliminary studies report encouraging efficacy with
minimal complications.

Alternatives to HRT (contd.)
Complementary therapies

Botanicals – evidence is limited and conflicting. Herbal medicines
have pharmacological actions and thus can cause unwanted effects
and have potentially dangerous interactions with other medicines.

• Phyto-oestrogens – soy and red clover.
* Plant substances that have similar effects to
oestrogens.
• Isoflavones – found in soybeans, chickpeas, red clover,
and in other legumes (beans and peas).
• Lignans – oilseeds such as flaxseed are rich in lignans;
also found in cereal bran, whole cereals, vegetables,
legumes, and fruit.
* Evidence is conflicting.
* Systematic review – no evidence that they help to
relieve symptoms.
• Isoflavone supplementation may produce a slight to
modest reduction in the number of daily flushes in
menopausal women.
* Unwanted effects are not increased.
* Owing to the oestrogenic actions, concerns about
safety in hormone-sensitive tissues such as breast
and uterus.

• Black cohosh (Actaea racemosa).
* There is no consensus as to the mechanism by
which it relieves hot flushes. Whether it has any
oestrogenic actions is debated; raises concerns
about its use in women with hormone-sensitive
conditions.
* Evidence is conflicting.
* Little is known about the long-term safety.
Possible liver toxicity has been reported.
• Evening primrose oil – rich in γ-linolenic and linolenic
acid.
* No evidence for its efficacy.
• Ginseng – has not been found to be superior to
placebo for VMS, PMB, and mastalgia.

• Reflexology
* Aims to relieve stress or treat health conditions
through the application of pressure to specific
points or areas of the feet, hands, and ears.
* Study comparing reflexology to nonspecific foot
massage reported a reduction in symptoms in both
groups, but there was no significant difference
between the groups.

145

Other complementary interventions – further research is needed.
Acupressure, acupuncture, Alexander technique, Ayurveda, osteopathy, hypnotherapy, reflexology, magnetism, and Reiki.

• Chinese herbs
* Dong quai (Angelica sinensis) – not superior to
placebo, but may be effective when combined
with other herbs. Interactions with warfarin and
photosensitization are reported.
* Trial on Danggui Buxue Tang – benefit over
placebo was found only for mild hot flushes.
* St John’s wort – shown to be efficacious in mild
to moderate depression because of its SSRI-type
effect, but its efficacy for VMS remains to be
proved. It interacts with many other medications.
It may cause breakthrough bleeding and
contraceptive failure when used concomitantly
with oral contraceptives.
* Agnus castus (chasteberry) – limited data.

• Acupuncture
* Evidence is conflicting.
* Systematic review failed to show beneficial effects
of acupuncture over ‘placebo’.
• Magnetism
* Various forms such as bracelets and insoles. There
is no known mechanism of action for magnet
therapies for the treatment of hot flushes. There is
no evidence of benefit at present.

SECTION 5

U rogynaecology, pelvic floor problems, and hormone replacement therapy

HRT after cancer

Sexual function/androgens

• Endometrial – no increased risk of recurrence or a reduced recurrence rate with an increased
disease-free interval. Most of these studies have been on early stage disease and the findings may be
different in advanced cancer where there may be microscopic metastatic deposits.
Local endometrial sarcomas are oestrogen sensitive and are a contraindication to HRT.
• Ovarian cancer – there is no evidence that oestrogen therapy following treatment for ovarian
cancer will adversely affect the prognosis. Studies have shown either no difference in survival rate
or an improvement in survival rate with the use of HRT in women with epithelial ovarian cancer.
There is no evidence of an adverse effect of HRT on women with germ cell tumours. There are no
data on the use of HRT following granulosa cell tumours, although HRT should be avoided in this
situation largely on theoretical grounds.
• Cervical – no association between cervical cancer and HRT. HRT is not contraindicated after
treatment for squamous cell carcinoma or adenocarcinoma of the cervix.
• Vulval – systemic and topical oestrogen can be used following vulval carcinoma. There is no
evidence of an adverse effect with regard to recurrence of vulval disease.

Women with distressing low sexual desire and tiredness:
• Androgen supplementation – testosterone gels licensed for male use are
available in 50 mg, 5ml sachets or tubes. Unlicensed prescribing by specialists
is an option for female androgen replacement, at a reduced dosage of 0.5–1.0
mL/day or a quarter-sachet/tube on alternate days. Androgenic side effects and
risks are minimal and reversible if testosterone levels are maintained within
the female physiological range.
• Tibolone has a weak androgenic effect, which can have a beneficial effect on
mood and libido.
• DHEA – further research is needed to confirm efficacy and safety.

Women requiring surgery
• Each woman requires an individual assessment of the risks and benefits
of stopping HRT before elective surgery.
• Consider stopping HRT four weeks before elective surgery; this may not
be necessary if appropriate thromboprophylaxis is used.

SECTION 6

Gynaecological oncology

Suspected gynaecological cancer – NICE recommendations for referral

If symptoms ­suggest gynaecological cancer, refer to a team specializing in the management of gynaecological cancer.

• Alterations in the menstrual cycle, IMB, PCB, PMB, or vaginal
discharge – perform speculum and pelvic examination. If
suspicion of cervical cancer.
• A cervical smear test is not required before referral, and a
previous negative cervical smear result is not a reason to delay
referral.

Suspected ovarian cancer

• If examination identifies ascites and/or a pelvic or abdominal
mass (which is not obviously uterine fibroids).

• Palpable abdominal or pelvic mass that is not obviously uterine
fibroids or not of gastrointestinal or urological origin – arrange
urgent USS. Refer if the USS suggests ovarian cancer.

• PMB:
* Women who are not on HRT.
* Women on HRT with persistent or unexplained PMB after
cessation of HRT for 6 weeks.
* Women taking tamoxifen.

• Persistent IMB and a negative pelvic examination.

• Vulval symptoms – vulval examination; unexplained
vulval lump.
• Vulval bleeding due to ulceration.

• Pruritus or pain – it is reasonable to use a period of ‘treat, watch
and wait’, with an active follow-up until symptoms resolve or a
diagnosis is confirmed. If symptoms persist, then refer as urgent
or non-urgent, depending on the symptoms and the degree of
concern about cancer.

Investigate with CA125

Urgent referral

• If a woman (especially if ≥ 50 years of age) reports any of the
following symptoms on a persistent or frequent basis, particularly > 12
times per month:
* Persistent abdominal distension (‘bloating’).
* Feeling full (early satiety) and/or loss of appetite.
* Pelvic or abdominal pain.
* Increased urinary urgency and/or frequency.
• Any woman ≥ 50 years of age who experienced symptoms within the
last 12 months that suggest IBS, as IBS rarely presents for the first time
in women of this age.
• Consider investigations if a woman reports unexplained weight loss,
fatigue, or changes in bowel habit.

CA125 ≥ 35 IU/ml – arrange an urgent USS of the abdomen and
pelvis. Refer if the USS suggests ovarian cancer.

Normal CA125 (< 35 IU/ml), or CA125 ≥ 35
IU/ml or greater but a normal USS – assess carefully for other clinical causes of her symptoms
and investigate if appropriate.

If no other clinical cause is apparent, advise to return if her symptoms become more frequent and/or persist.

CHAPTER 29 Vulval dystrophy and vulvar intra-epithelial neoplasia

History
• Nonspecific symptoms such as pruritus and pain; change in skin colour and texture.
• Explore symptoms at other skin sites.
• Past history of abnormal cervical cytology, smoking, and immune deficiency in women with
suspected VIN.
• Personal or family history of:
* Autoimmune conditions (thyroid disorders, alopecia areata, pernicious anaemia, type 1
diabetes) associated with lichen sclerosus and erosive lichen planus.
* Atopic conditions (hay fever, asthma, eczema) associated with vulval dermatitis.
• Symptoms of urinary or faecal incontinence as dermatitis may be exacerbated by moisture,
temperature, and friction.
• Medical and drug history – self-medication or previous inadequate or inappropriate
treatments.
• Enquire about over-the-counter preparations that may aggravate skin conditions.
• Any potential allergens and irritants.

Background and prevalence
• Symptoms and signs of vulval skin disorders are common.
• Community-based surveys indicate that about one fifth of women have significant vulval
symptoms.
• Lichen sclerosus accounts for at least 25% of the women seen in vulval clinics. Estimated
incidence in patients referred to dermatology clinics is 1/300 to 1/1000.
• Specialist MDT and other services, such as a patch test clinic, psychosexual counsellors, or
reconstructive surgeons, may be necessary for appropriate management.

Differential diagnosis
Examination
Systematic examination of the anogenital region and other skin and mucosal sites

• Systematically examine the vulva.
• Examine other lower genital tract sites including the vagina, cervix, and perianal skin.
• Examine the rest of the body including the mouth for signs of lichen planus, and the scalp,
elbows, knees, and nails for psoriasis.
• Eczema may be seen at any site.

•

Dermatitis.
Vulval candidiasis.
Lichen simplex.
Lichen sclerosus and lichen planus.
Dermatoses.
Infection.
Contact dermatitis.
Hormone deficiency.
Systemic skin disorders.

Management

Investigations
• Test for thyroid disease, diabetes, and STIs, if clinically indicated.
• Biopsy – not necessary when a clear diagnosis can be made on history and clinical examination.
* Needed if the woman fails to respond to treatment or there is clinical suspicion of VIN or
cancer.
* Biopsy all atypical or suspicious areas to exclude invasive disease.
• Circulating autoantibodies – for other autoimmune conditions in women suspected of lichen
sclerosus or lichen planus.
• Serum ferritin – in women with vulval dermatitis.
• Skin patch testing – for women with vulval dermatitis; 26–80% may have at least one positive
result on patch testing.

151

General advice

• Avoid any potential irritants.
• Emollients – protect the skin and restore skin barrier function.
• Avoid contact with soap, shampoo, and bubble bath. Use simple emollients as a
soap substitute and general moisturizer.
• Avoid tight fitting garments that may irritate the area.
• Avoid use of spermicidally lubricated condoms.
• Provide a detailed explanation of the condition with an emphasis on the
long-term implications.

SECTION 6

Gynaecological oncology

VIN
Two types depending on its histopathological characteristics.

Differentiated type
•
•
•
•
•
•

Rarer.
Seen in older women, aged 55–85 years.
Some cases are associated with lichen sclerosus.
Linked to keratinizing squamous cell carcinomas of the vulva.
Clinically – unifocal in the form of an ulcer or plaque.
Risk of progression appears to be higher than in usual type VIN.

Usual type
•
•
•
•
•

Warty, basaloid, and mixed.
More common in women aged 35–55 years.
Associated with HPV-16, CIN, VaIN, smoking, and chronic immunosuppression.
May be multifocal and multicentric.
Appearance varies widely: red, white, or pigmented; plaques, papules, or patches;
erosions, nodules, warty or hyperkeratosis.
• Associated with warty or basaloid squamous cell carcinoma.

http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/CBO9781316156513.030

Management
To relieve symptoms of severe pruritus, exclude invasive disease and reduce the
risk of developing invasive cancer.

• Surgical management

Non-surgical management

• Local excision provides a specimen for histological diagnosis and is adequate, with the same
recurrence rates as vulvectomy.
• Simple vulvectomy and radical vulvectomy are inappropriate owing to their adverse effects
on sexual function and body image.
• 12–17% of women undergoing excision of VIN have clinically unrecognized invasion
diagnosed on histology.
• Complete response rates are higher with excision than with ablative or medical treatment.
• Risk of recurrence is lower if surgical margins are free from disease. Even with clear surgical
margins, there is still a residual risk of recurrence.
• Women undergoing surgical excision should have access to reconstructive surgery. With
larger lesions, multifocal lesions, or certain anatomical sites, scarring and tension can result
in pain and psychosexual morbidity.

• Women require regular, long-term follow-up.
• It avoids the complications of surgery and spares vulval anatomy.
• Topical imiquimod cream – 15–81% clinical and histological response rate; regimen used
2–3 times per week. Adverse effects include pain, erythema, and swelling, and can result in
non-compliance.
• Cidofovir – has shown a clinical and histological response.
• Laser ablation – effective. Treatment failure rates are about 40%, but laser ablation is not
suitable for hair-bearing skin owing to the involvement of skin appendages. Laser therapy
is most useful where tissue conservation is important, such as in the glans and hood of the
clitoris or when surgery is contraindicated.
• Small case series have evaluated the use of cavitron, ultrasonic surgical aspiration,
photodynamic therapy, interferon, and therapeutic HPV vaccine, but there is insufficient
evidence to recommend any of these for treatment in routine clinical care.

Surveillance
•
•
•
•

153

Follow-up annually for vulvoscopy, or careful clinical assessment and biopsy of any suspicious areas.
Risk of cancer developing within 8 years of diagnosis is 40–60%.
Women treated surgically for VIN still have a residual risk of developing invasive cancer (4%).
4% of women diagnosed with VIN will have intra-epithelial neoplasia at other lower genital tract sites. Perform colposcopy at
follow-ups. Women with usual type VIN with multifocal/multicentric disease are at higher risk of recurrence. Follow-up with specialist
colposcopy service to ensure inspection of other lower genital tract sites, including the cervix, vagina, and vulval and perianal skin.

SECTION 6

Gynaecological oncology

Lichen sclerosus
• Accounts for at least 25% of the women seen in vulval clinics, and one in 300–1000 of all patients referred to dermatology clinics.
• Can present at any age, but is more commonly seen in post-menopausal women.
• It is an autoimmune condition, with around 40% having another autoimmune condition.

Symptoms
• Severe pruritus, which may be worse at night.
• Uncontrollable scratching may cause trauma with bleeding and skin splitting,
and symptoms of discomfort, pain, and dyspareunia.
• Occasionally, the labia minora fuse together medially, which also restricts the
vaginal opening and can cause difficulty with micturition, and even urinary
retention.

Examination
•
•
•
•
•

Whole vulval perianal area may be affected in a figure-of-eight distribution.
Active inflammation with erythema and keratinization of the vulval skin.
Hyperkeratosis can be marked with thickened white skin.
Skin is often atrophic, with subepithelial haemorrhages, and it may split easily.
Continuing inflammation results in inflammatory adhesions. Lateral fusion of the labia
minora, which become adherent and eventually are completely reabsorbed. The hood of the
clitoris and its lateral margins may fuse, burying the clitoris. Midline fusion can produce skin
bridges at the fourchette and narrowing of the introitus.

Medical management – ultra-potent steroids

• Anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive properties by altering
lymphocyte differentiation and function.
• Clobetasol propionate is the most potent topical corticosteroid.
• Complete or partial resolution of symptoms in 54–96% of women.
• Probability of remission is significantly associated with age. Women under
the age of 50 years have the highest response rates.
• Relapse – 84% of women experience a relapse within 4 years.

• Various regimens are used; one of the most common is daily use for
1 month, alternate days for 1 month, twice weekly for 1 month, with
review at 2–3 months. There is no evidence on the optimal regimen.
• Maintenance treatment may be required and can be either with weaker
steroid preparations or less frequent use of very potent steroids.
• 30 g of very potent steroid lasts at least 3 months.
• Ointment bases are less allergenic but the choice of base will depend on
patient tolerability.

http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/CBO9781316156513.030

Steroid-resistant disease – ≈ 4–10% do not improve with topical ultra-potent steroids

• A very potent topical steroid with antibacterial and
antifungal agent; e.g., Dermovate NN or a preparation
that combats secondary infection (such as Nystaform)
may be appropriate if secondary infection is a concern.
• Oral retinoids, e.g., acitretin may be effective in severe
recalcitrant disease but it should only be given by
experienced dermatologists.
• Successful UVA phototherapy has been reported in a small
number of cases.

Tacrolimus and pimicrolimus (calcineurin inhibitors):
• Immunosuppressant drugs, reduce inflammation by
suppressing T-lymphocyte response.
• Under the supervision of a specialist clinic.
• Off-licence use.
• Maximal effects seen after 10–24 weeks of treatment with
77% full or partial response.
• Well tolerated and avoids the adverse effects of steroids.
• Long-term safety is not established; do not use for > 2
years owing to concerns about potential malignancy.

Surgical management
Surgery and CO2 laser vaporization – not recommended.

• Laser surgery may be useful in treating the sequelae
of scarring secondary to lichen sclerosus, such
as urinary retention or narrowing of the vaginal
introitus.
• Surgery – for the treatment of coexistent VIN/SCC
or fusion. Disease tends to recur around the scar.

Follow-up
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

155

After 2–3 months, to assess response to treatment.
Assess active disease, as clinically required.
Review stable disease annually, except in well-counselled patients who control their symptoms well.
Lifetime risk of developing invasive vulval cancer – 2–4%.
There is no evidence that follow-up of women with lichen sclerosus needs to be hospital based.
Best practice is to recommend self-surveillance.
Provide information regarding the risk of invasive disease, small risk of neoplastic change; advise them to contact the
doctor if they notice a change in appearance or texture (e.g., lump or hardening of skin).

SECTION 6

Gynaecological oncology

Other vulval skin conditions
Lichen planus

• May affect skin anywhere on the body.
• Usually affects mucosal surfaces and is more commonly seen in oral mucosa.
• Polygonal flat-topped violaceous purpuric plaques and papules with a fine white reticular pattern
(Wickham striae).
• In the mouth and genital region, it can be erosive and is more commonly associated with pain than
with pruritus.
• Erosive lichen planus appears as a well-demarcated, glazed erythema around the introitus.
• Aetiology is unknown; may be an autoimmune condition.

Lichen simplex chronic or chronicus vulval dermatitis

• Severe intractable pruritus, especially at night.
• Nonspecific inflammation often involves the labia majora but can extend to the mons pubis and
inner thighs.
• There may be erythema and swelling with discrete areas of thickening and lichenification.
• Symptoms can be exacerbated by chemical or contact dermatitis, and are sometimes linked to
stress or low body iron stores.
• Treatment – general care of the vulva; avoid potential irritants and use emollients and soap
substitutes.
* Antihistamines or anti-pruritics, especially if sleep is disturbed.
* Moderate or ultra-potent topical steroids may be necessary to break the itch–scratch cycle.

Vulval psoriasis

• Can involve the skin of the vulva but not vaginal mucosa.
• Appearance of vulval psoriasis differs from the typical scale of non-genital sites; it often appears as
smooth, non-scaly red or pink discrete lesions.
• Examine other sites including nails and scalp.
• Emollients, soap substitutes, topical steroids, and calcipotriene.
• Do not use cold tar preparations in genital sites.

Beçhet’s disease

•
•
•
•

A chronic multisystem disease characterized by recurrent oral and genital ulcers.
Ulcers can involve cervix, vulva, or vagina.
Ulcers are usually recurrent and painful and can leave scarring.
Topical or systemic immunosuppressants.

http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/CBO9781316156513.030

Vulval candidiasis

• Irritation and soreness of the vulva and anus rather than discharge.
• Diabetes, obesity, and antibiotic use may be contributory.
• May become chronic, with a leading edge of inflammation with satellite lesions extending out from
the labia majora to the inner thighs or mons pubis.
• Prolonged topical antifungal therapy with oral or topical preparations.

Vulval Crohn’s disease

• Can involve the vulva by direct extension from involved bowel or ‘metastatic’ granulomas.
• Rarely, seen without known bowel disease or preceding the presentation of bowel disease.
• Vulva is often swollen and oedematous with granulomas, abscesses, draining sinuses, and
ulceration.
• Avoid surgery as it can result in sinus and fistula formation and tissue breakdown.
• Treatments include metronidazole and oral immunomodulators.

Paget’s disease

•
•
•
•
•
•

Rare vulval condition seen in post-menopausal women.
Main symptom is pruritus.
Lesions have a florid eczematous appearance with lichenification, erythema, and excoriation.
Can be associated with an underlying adenocarcinoma.
Check the gastrointestinal tract, urinary tract, and breasts.
Surgical excision to exclude adenocarcinoma of a skin appendage. Surgical margins are difficult to
achieve owing to subclinical disease, and recurrence is common.

Seborrhoeic dermatitis

• Most common signs are scaling and erythema.
• Extra-genital areas are usually involved – eyebrows, nasolabial folds, peri-auricular, posterior
hairline, and axilla.
• Short hyphae and spores of Tinea versicolor may be seen on the potassium hydroxide preparation
of the lesional scales.
• Treatment is with topical keratolytic agents and/or 1% hydrocortisone preparation.

Gynaecological oncology

CHAPTER 30 Vulval cancer

Prevalence and incidence

History
• History – pruritus, discomfort, pain, visible or palpable lesion, ulceration, bleeding, dysuria
or vaginal discharge. Skin showing colour changes, elevation or irregularity of surface.
• Post-menopausal woman presenting for the first time with lesions assumed to be vulval
condyloma – get a biopsy for histological confirmation as newly acquired condylomas are
unusual in this age group.
• Unexplained vulval lump/mass – refer urgently.
• Vulval bleeding, pruritus, pain, and ulceration – it is reasonable to use a period of ‘treat,
watch, and wait’ with active follow-up until these symptoms resolve or a diagnosis is
confirmed. If symptoms persist refer to secondary care.

Risk factors
• Lichen sclerosus (4–7%), vulval intra-epithelial neoplasia (VIN) and multifocal disease
(5–90%), Paget’s disease, and melanoma in situ.
• Lichen sclerosus is relatively common and it is not practical to follow-up all women once
their symptoms are controlled. Review urgently if persistent ulceration or new growth.
• High-grade VIN, VIN with high-grade multicentric disease, VIN in the immunosuppressed
and those with Paget’s disease or melanoma in situ probably pose higher risks for
progression, therefore follow them up at least annually.
• HPV (types 16, 18, and 31) is associated with approximately 30–40% of cases and 80% of
VIN.
• Previous cervical cancer or CIN increases risk of vulval cancer.
• Infection with HSV type 2 may increase the risk of vulval cancer. This virus may interact
with HPV to cause vulval and other cancers in the genital and anal area.
• Women who have had radiotherapy treatment for uterine cancer have an increased risk of
vulval cancer some years later.

Examination
• Inspection – 90% of women have a visible tumour. Assess the size and location.
• Assess involvement of the vagina, urethra, base of bladder, and anus.
• Palpate to assess whether the tumour is infiltrating deep to the pubic and ischial
bones.
• EUA may be necessary because of the pain often associated with large tumours.
• Assess groin lymphadenopathy.

Rate per 100,000

• Cancer of the vulva and vagina accounts for < 1% of all cancer cases and 8% of
gynaecological cancers diagnosed in women in the UK.
• The 20th most common cancer among women.
• UK (2010) – 1172 women diagnosed and 410 died from vulval cancer.
• Crude incidence rate is 1.7/100,000 women and a death rate is 1.2/100,000 women.
• Vulval cancer is a disease of elderly women in their 70s and 80s; incidence increases with age
peaking in women aged 85 years or more; 80% occur among women > 60 years of age.
• Lifetime risk of developing vulval cancer is around 1/293 for women in the UK.

For small suspicious lesions, refer women to a gynaecological cancer centre, to be seen within 2 weeks.
Manage vulval cancer in gynaecological cancer centre by MDT (including gynaecological oncologist and clinical oncologist).
If a surgical approach is not an option, manage by a clinical oncologist with an appointment within 2 weeks.
Commence surgical treatment within 4 weeks of diagnosis.
Commence radiotherapy within 4 weeks of the decision to treat.

Representative biopsy
• Include the area of epithelium where there is a transition of normal to malignant tissue; of sufficient size (> 1 mm depth
to allow differentiation between superficially invasive and frankly invasive tumours) and orientated to allow pathological
interpretation.
• In cases of elderly woman with major medical problems and a severely symptomatic lesion, a small punch biopsy under LA
may be adequate.
• In cases where the clinical diagnosis is apparent and the patient is very symptomatic, i.e., heavy bleeding or pain, definitive
surgery to the vulval lesion may be performed but take biopsy with frozen section prior to any radical procedure.
• Consider excisional biopsy only in small lesions where a wide margin of normal tissue can also be excised.
• Do not undertake radical treatment without prior biopsy confirmation of malignancy.

• Histology:
* Squamous cell carcinomas – 90%.
* Melanoma, Paget’s disease, Bartholin’s gland tumours,
adenocarcinoma, and basal cell carcinoma – 10%.
• Tumours most commonly occur on the labia majora,
but are also found on the labia minora, clitoris, and
perineum; melanomas are more likely to affect the clitoris
or labia minora.

Investigations
Once the diagnosis is confirmed, to determine the extent of the disease and suitability for treatment:
• Full blood count. • Biochemical profile. • Chest X-ray. • Electrocardiogram.
• Cervical smear if normal cervical smear is overdue.
• For tumours > 2 cm in diameter, perform CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis to detect disease above the inguinal ligament.
• Take a fine-needle aspirate of any clinically suspicious nodes or other metastases where the result will alter management.
• A preoperative vulvoscopy may help in the planning of surgery.

anus), with negative LNs.

• IA – tumour confined to vulva or vulva and
perineum, greatest dimension ≤ 2 cm, stromal
invasion of ≤ 1.0 mm.
• IB – tumour confined to vulva or vulva and
perineum, greatest dimension < 2 cm, stromal
invasion > 1.0 mm with negative LNs.
• 5-year survival – 79%.

• 5-year survival – 59%.

				

• IIIA – with 1 LN metastasis, any size, or 2
LN metastases < 5 mm.
• IIIB – with ≥ 2 LN metastases > 5 mm or
≥ 3 LN metastases < 5 mm.
• IIIC – positive LNs with extracapsular
spread.
• 5-year survival – 43%.

Prognostic factors
• Histology represents a variable in determining the likelihood of LN involvement.
• Presence of infiltrative growth patterns, compared with a pushing pattern and
LVSI, is associated with a higher local recurrence rate. Both are markers of poor
prognosis but they do not indicate the need for adjuvant treatment.
• LVSI has not been associated with an increased risk of groin node metastasis.
• About 30% of women with operable disease have nodal spread.
• Nodal status, site, and size of the primary lesion are the main variables
associated with prognosis.
• The 5-year survival in cases with no LN involvement is >80%. This falls to
< 50% if the inguinal nodes are involved and 10–15% if the iliac or other pelvic
nodes are involved.

• IVA – tumour invades any of the
following: * Bladder mucosa. * Rectal
mucosa. * Upper urethral mucosa or is
fixed to bone and/or bilateral regional LN
metastases.

Management

• Stage IA
* Wide local excision (WLE) only, without
groin node dissection (GND), because the
risk of LN metastases is negligible.
• Stage IB
* WLE with GND.

• Stage II or worse
* WLE with GND.

• Stage III
* WLE with a minimum of 1 cm diseasefree margin.
* Radical vulvectomy – large primary
lesion and clinically suspicious nodes – a
radical vulvectomy with ‘en-bloc’ GND.

• Stage IV
* Excision +/- chemoradiation.
* Consider reconstructive surgery in
all cases where radical excision is
contemplated.

Surgery for early stage (I and II)

Need for adequate resection margins (1 cm)

Groin node dissection

• Aim for adequate margins with surgery – incidence of vulval recurrence is related to the
measured disease-free surgical margin.
• WLE with a minimum margin of 15 mm of disease-free tissue is often sufficient.
• When the surgical margins are < 1 cm, it may be appropriate to perform a further local
resection, although there is no evidence of reduction in local recurrence. There is no evidence
to recommend adjuvant local therapy in patients with close surgical margins.
• Consider excision of atypical skin (lichen sclerosus or VIN) affecting the remainder of the
vulva, as these areas might contain separate foci of invasion.
• Complications associated with surgery: * Wound breakdown. * Wound infection.
* DVT and PE. * Pressure sores. * Introital stenosis. * Urinary incontinence.
* Rectocele. * Faecal incontinence. * Inguinal lymphocyst. * Lymphoedema.
* Hernia. * Psychosexual complications.

• Radical GND is associated with significant morbidity; however, nodal metastasis is the
main prognostic factor. Appropriate GND is the single most important factor in decreasing
mortality.
• Omit it in stage IA squamous cancer, verrucous tumour, basal cell carcinoma, and melanoma.
• For lateral disease – ipsilateral GND is adequate; contralateral GND may be required if
ipsilateral nodes are positive.
• For central disease – bilateral GND. Undertake through separate incisions (triple incision
technique) to reduce morbidity. The incidence of skin bridge recurrence in early stage disease
is very low.
• Remove superficial inguinal nodes, as well as the deep femoral nodes. Superficial inguinal
LND alone is associated with a higher risk of groin node recurrence.
• Preservation of the long saphenous vein may reduce both groin wound and subsequent lower
limb problems.
• Recently, sentinel node biopsy (the sentinel node receives the primary lymphatic flow from
the tumour) has been introduced to reduce morbidity; studies have shown NPV of 95–100%.

SECTION 6

Gynaecological oncology

Advanced vulval cancer (Stage III and
IV) Multimodality treatment

Surgery – vulvectomy, GND

• Radical vulvectomy, anovulvectomy might be an option in selected cases.
• Skin-bridge recurrence is more likely to occur in patients with positive lymph
nodes. An en-bloc dissection is advised if the nodes are known or suspected to be
positive, to remove the tissue between the vulva and involved nodes.
• Reconstructive surgical techniques to enable primary surgical closure and to
reduce morbidity due to scarring.
• GND – when there are clinically suspicious groin nodes.
• In cases with fixed or ulcerated groin nodes, consider surgery and/or RT. There
are no data suggesting the superiority of one treatment over the other.

Chemotherapy

• Can be used:
* As an adjuvant postoperatively, concomitant with RT for node-positive
disease.
* Concomitantly with pelvic RT for management of inoperable/unresectable
disease.
* Neoadjuvantly to ‘downstage’ tumours and to render them more suitable for
either delayed primary surgery or RT.
* Either alone or concomitant with RT for the management of relapsed disease.

Radiotherapy

• RT allows for sphincter preserving surgery and as an alternative to surgery for GND.
• In the post-radiation setting, surgery can be more complicated and there is increased morbidity.
Primary radiotherapy

• Preoperative RT may allow for sphincter-preserving surgery.
• RT may also be used for histologically proven involved GLNs. It is unknown whether postradiation GLN removal is advantageous in terms of outcome.
• Individual women who are not fit enough to withstand surgery can be treated with primary RT.
Adjuvant radiotherapy

•
•
•
•

Factors influencing the need for RT are surgical margins and GLN positivity.
Not enough evidence to recommend adjuvant local therapy in patients with close surgical margins.
Adjuvant treatment for positive margins has an improved survival compared with observation.
Consider adjuvant RT when:
* Either groin has ≥ 2 LN involved with microscopic metastatic disease.
* Or there is complete replacement.
* And/or extra-capsular spread in any node.
• No evidence on whether adjuvant RT should be given to both sides or to the involved side only.
• Treat both groin and the pelvic nodes.

		

Vulval cancer - 5 year survival rate %

Follow-up

80

• Long-term review is recommended, as these patients remain at an increased risk of developing
carcinomas elsewhere in the genital tract and pelvis, even though routine follow-up does not
offer early detection or survival advantage.
• Follow-up intervals are arbitrary and the following schedule is suggested:
* 3-monthly in first year.
* 6-monthly in second and third years.
* Annual review thereafter.
• Women with carcinoma of the vulva are at an increased risk of developing other genital
cancers, particularly cervical cancer.

Recurrent disease
• Recurrence rate – 15–33%. The most common site of recurrence is the vulva in 70%, the groin nodes in
24%, the pelvis in 16%, and distant metastases in 19% of cases.
• Treatment and outcome depend on the site and extent of the recurrence.
• Local recurrence – WLE can result in a 5-year survival rate of 56% when the inguinal nodes are
negative.
• If excision would impair sphincter function, consider RT as the first choice. If RT has already been
given to maximum dose, then consider excision.
• Groin recurrence has a much poorer prognosis and is difficult to manage. In women who have not
been treated previously with groin RT, RT (with or without additional surgery) would be the preferred
option. The options are much more limited in those who have already been irradiated; consider
palliation, which may include surgery.
• Chemotherapy for relapsed disease may be determined by what previous treatments have been offered
and also by the age, performance status, and renal function of the patient.

CHAPTER 31 Cervical intra-epithelial neoplasia and colposcopy

HPV – HPV testing as a form of risk assessment
Background and pathogenesis
• CIN is the pre-invasive stage of cervical cancer. It denotes atypical changes in the transformation
zone of the cervix. Time taken from development of cytological abnormality to invasive cancer
could be up to 15–20 years. Most cases of CIN remain stable, or are eliminated by the host’s
immune system without intervention. However, a small percentage of cases progress to cervical
cancer if left untreated. Roughly one third of early CIN lesions disappear spontaneously, one
third persist, and one third progress to CIN 3 or invasive cancer.
• Regression rate depends mainly on the grade of CIN and the age of the woman. Regression is
more common in women younger than 30 years. High-grade lesions of CIN 2 and CIN 3 have
higher risk of progression to invasive cancer. Women who are immunocompromised are also at
higher risk of progression.
• Cervical screening is a method of preventing cancer by detecting and treating early abnormalities
which, if left untreated, could lead to cervical cancer.
• Since the start of NHS Cervical Screening Programme (NHSCSP), cervical cancer incidence rates
have almost halved (16/100,000 women in 1986–1988 to 8.5/100,000 women in 2006–2008).
• Cervical screening saves approximately 4500 lives per year in England and prevents up to 3900
cases of cervical cancer per year in the UK. It can prevent around 75% of cancer cases in women
who attend regularly.

HPV – triage of low-grade abnormalities and test of cure – advantage is rapid diagnosis and,

providing there is no abnormality, a rapid return to normal recall.
HPV testing for follow-up of treated CIN – there is some evidence to suggest that all
women who have had treatment for CIN should have an HPV (Hybrid Capture or
HC2) test and a cervical cytology after 6 months and HPV test after 12–18 months.
If all three of these tests are negative, the patient can be returned to routine screening
at 3- (for those < 49 years of age) or 5-yearly intervals (for those aged 50–64 years).
If both cytology and HPV testing are negative at six months, then the risk of CIN 2+
over the next two years is less than 0.5%. Returning these women to normal recall
after six months would prevent the need for 10 annual cytology tests as currently
recommended.
Population screening with HPV testing – primary screening with high-risk HPV DNA
testing generally detects more than 90% of all CIN 2/3 or cancer cases, and is ≈ 25%
more sensitive than cytology at a cut-off of borderline dyskaryosis or worse. However, it
is about 6% less specific. HPV testing is not currently recommended for routine use.

Offer routine screening for women – The NHS Cervical Screening Programme

• The first stage in cervical screening is taking a sample using liquid-based cytology (LBC).

Age of referral and smear intervals
• 3-year interval for women aged 25–49 years and 5 years for women 50–64 years of age. 3-yearly screening
offers protection of 84% compared to 5-yearly screening (73%) for cervical cancer at ages 40–54 years, but
is almost as good as annual screening (88%).
• Starting age of screening is 25 years old. Screening women under the age of 25 years may do more harm
than good. In 2007, 56 cases of cervical cancer were registered among women aged 15–24 years in England
and Wales and a total of 3 deaths were reported. The incidence of cervical cancer in the < 25-year age group
is low and the prevalence of transient HPV infection is high. Much of the low-grade disease would resolve
spontaneously. Screening may thus lead to unnecessary attendances at colposcopy, with the possibility of
increased anxiety, overtreatment, and potentially negative consequences. Screening has not been shown to be
effective at reducing the incidence of invasive cancer in women under the age of 25 years.
• Routine screening ends at the age of 65 years. Although it may possibly be safe to withdraw well-screened
women with 3 consecutive negative cervical samples from the screening programme at age 50 years, at
present there is insufficient evidence to warrant this.

• Additional cervical screening is not justified in any of the following
situations,
providing the woman is in the age group to be screened and has undergone
screening within the previous 3–5 years:
* On taking or starting to take an oral contraceptive.
* On insertion of an IUCD.
* On taking or starting to take HRT.
* In association with pregnancy – either antenatally or postnatally, or after
termination, unless a previous screening test was abnormal.
* In women with genital warts.
* In women with vaginal discharge.
* In women with pelvic infection.
* In women who have had multiple sexual partners.
* In women who are heavy cigarette smokers.

http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/CBO9781316156513.032

Dyskaryosis – cytology findings
• Dyskaryosis – a disproportionate nuclear enlargement in comparison to the amount of
cytoplasm present in the cell. These cells have abnormal chromatin content and distribution and
abnormal nuclear shape. These are precursors to cancer.
• Mild dyskaryosis – typical koilocytes – cells showing perinuclear clearing of the cytoplasm with
a hard margin to the vacuole (arrowed) with features of mild dyskaryosis.
• Moderate dyskaryosis – intermediate squamous cells with dyskaryotic nuclei, with some
binucleation and koilocytosis.
• Severe dyskaryosis – nuclei enlarged, with variation in shape and size, and hyperchromasia and
irregular nuclear outline.

Refer to colposcopy – cervical screening showing:

•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

3 consecutive inadequate samples (within 8 weeks).
3 borderline nuclear change in squamous cells in a series (within 8 weeks).
1 borderline nuclear change in endocervical cells (within 8 weeks).
3 abnormal tests at any grade in a 10-year period (within 8 weeks).
Ideally, 1 mild dyskaryosis, but it remains acceptable to repeat the test. Women must be referred
after 2 mild dyskaryosis results (within 8 weeks).
1 moderate dyskaryosis (within 4 weeks).
1 severe dyskaryosis (within 4 weeks).
1 possible invasion (within 2 weeks).
1 possible glandular neoplasia (within 2 weeks).
Women who have been treated for CIN and have not been returned to routine recall, and a
subsequent test is reported as mild dyskaryosis or worse.

Mild dyskaryosis

Severe dyskaryosis

Gynaecological examination and onward referral for colposcopy if cancer is suspected for:

• Women with an abnormal cervix (within 2 weeks).
• Women presenting with symptoms of cervical cancer – such as PCB (particularly in women
> 40 years of age), IMB, and persistent vaginal discharge.
• Contact bleeding at the time of cervical sampling may often occur and is not an indication
for referral for colposcopy in the absence of other symptoms or an abnormal result.

Colposcopy
• Naked eye visualization of the cervix can only detect invasive disease but cannot differentiate
pre-invasive disease from normal cervix. Colposcopic examination helps to identify these
lesions. This allows clinical verification of cytology report.
• Colposcope provides illumination and magnification (6–40 fold) of the cervix.
• It is not diagnostic in itself, it helps to evaluate the abnormal cytology as an aid to diagnosis to
guide further management.
• Consider colposcopic screening in addition to cytology for routine cervical screening in very
high-risk groups of women who are at increased risk of CIN; they include immunosuppressed
women, such as transplant recipients or patients with renal failure requiring dialysis.
• Take a history prior to examination – menstrual cycles/LMP, contraception, pregnancy,
smoking, previous cytology/previous treatment if any.
• Saline, acetic acid and Lugol’s iodine are used sequentially and changes on the cervix are noted
as benign, low-grade CIN, high-risk CIN, or invasive changes.
• Record the following data at the colposcopic examination: * Reason for referral: * Grade
of cytological abnormality. * Whether the examination is satisfactory (this is defined as the
entire squamocolumnar junction having been seen and the upper limit of any cervical lesion also
being seen). * Presence or absence of vaginal and/or endocervical extension. * Colposcopic
features. * Colposcopic impression of lesion grade.

SECTION 6

Gynaecological oncology

Women referred with moderate or severe dyskaryosis (high-grade):

Women referred with mild dyskaryosis or less:

• Normal colposcopy – these women are at significant risk of CIN 2 or 3 even in the
presence of normal colposcopy. Take a biopsy. If treatment is not undertaken, keep
a close surveillance with colposcopy and cytology every 6 months. If, at follow-up, a
high-grade cytological abnormality persists, undertake an excisional treatment.
• Colposcopically low-grade lesion – with satisfactory colposcopy, take multiple
biopsies as the likelihood of an underlying high-grade lesion in this situation
is extremely high. If CIN 1 or less is confirmed, provide close colposcopic and
cytological follow-up.

• Normal and satisfactory colposcopy – at low risk of developing cervical cancer. Repeat
cytology in 6 months.
* If this is normal, they can be returned to recall.
* If this is borderline, repeat test in 12 months.
* If this is mild dyskaryosis, repeat colposcopy with another cytology within 12 months.
* Any other cytology result warrants further colposcopy with or without biopsies.
• Colposcopically directed punch biopsy from a normal transformation zone is of no benefit
following a low-grade referral.
• Colposcopically low-grade lesion – may be treated or followed up at 6–12 months in the
colposcopy clinic or by the GP. Colposcopic biopsy at initial assessment is not essential. If the
lesion has not resolved within 2 years, take a biopsy. In practice, many women are offered
treatment at this point as persistent surveillance risks default.

Directed biopsy
• Unless an excisional treatment is planned, take a biopsy when the cytology
indicates moderate dyskaryosis or worse, and always when a recognizably atypical
transformation zone is present. Pregnancy is an exception.
• If colposcopically directed biopsy is reported as inadequate for histological
interpretation, repeat it if there is a residual colposcopic lesion.
• All women must have histological diagnosis established before destructive therapy.

Excisional biopsy
• Undertake excisional biopsy only when:
* Most of the ectocervix is replaced with high-grade abnormality.
* Low-grade colposcopic change is associated with severe dyskaryosis or worse.
* A lesion extends into the canal. Sufficient canal must be removed with endocervical extension
of abnormality.
• Options are: knife cone biopsy, laser conization, large loop excision of the transformation zone
(LLETZ), laser ablation, cryocautery, cold coagulation, and radical diathermy.
• Use cryocautery only for low-grade CIN with a double freeze–thaw–freeze technique. The rate
of clearance of CIN 3 is poor. The double freeze technique has a lower incidence of residual
disease compared with a single freeze technique.

Ablative techniques are only suitable when:

• Entire transformation zone is visualized.
• There is no evidence of glandular abnormality.
• There is no evidence of invasive disease.
• There is no major discrepancy between cytology and histology.
Only in exceptional circumstances should ablative treatment be
­considered for women over 50 years of age.

http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/CBO9781316156513.032

CIN in histology findings
CIN 1 features – abundant koilocytosis; the atypical cells extend through the epithelium with
some differentiation in the middle and upper thirds and atypical basal changes.
CIN 2 – an increase in atypical supra-basal cells that extend through about half the epithelial
thickness. Nuclear atypia and hyperchromasia are present, multinucleated cells are common,
mitotic figures can be seen extending into the middle part of the epithelium.
CIN 3 – full thickness atypia with proliferation of supra-basal cells exhibiting hyperchromasia:
hardly detectable surface differentiation with mitosis present close to the surface.

CIN 1

CIN 3

Repeat excision
• CIN 3 extending to the lateral or deep margins of excision (or uncertain margin status) results in a higher incidence of recurrence, but
routine repeat excision is not needed provided:
* There is no evidence of glandular abnormality. * There is no evidence of invasive disease. * The woman is < 50 years of age.
• Repeat excision to try to obtain clear margins in all women > 50 years old, who have CIN 3 at the lateral or deep margins, and in
whom satisfactory cytology and colposcopy cannot be guaranteed.
• Women with adenocarcinoma in situ or cGIN who wish to retain fertility can be managed by local excision. Incomplete excision at
the lateral or deep margins requires a further excision to obtain clear margins and exclude occult invasive disease.
• Micro-invasive squamous cancer FIGO stage IA 1 can be managed by local excisional techniques if the excision margins are free
of both CIN and invasive disease. If the invasive lesion is excised but CIN extends to the excision margin, then a repeat excision to
confirm excision of the CIN and to exclude further invasive disease is required. This should be performed, even in those cases planned
for hysterectomy, to exclude an occult invasive lesion requiring radical surgery.

Follow-up with cytology at six months
• Women who do not have negative test results after treatment – re-colposcope at least once within 12 months.
• Women treated for high-grade disease (CIN 2, CIN 3, cGIN) require 6- and 12-month follow-up cytology and annual cytology for
the subsequent 9 years (high-risk follow-up).
• Women treated for low-grade disease require 6-, 12-, and 24-month follow-up cytology. If all results are negative, then each woman
may be returned to screening at the routine interval (low-risk follow-up).
• If a woman has not attended for all the specified cytology for her high-risk follow-up, allow her to return to routine screening
provided her samples are normal at least 10 years after treatment.
• Women treated for cervical glandular intra-epithelial neoplasia (cGIN) are at somewhat higher risk of developing recurrent disease
than those with high-grade CIN. In addition, recurrent disease is more difficult to detect cytologically in women with cGIN. Ideally,
take 6-monthly samples for 5 years, followed by annual samples for a further 5 years.

SECTION 6

In women with severe cervical stenosis, it may not be possible to obtain a cytological sample that is representative of the whole transformation zone. The options
are:
• Hysterectomy.
• Cervical dilatation.
• Withdrawal from further recall in the NHSCSP.
Consider cervical dilatation in all cases. Cervical dilatation or hysterectomy is
recommended for women with a history of high-grade CIN, cGIN, or unexplained
high-grade cytology.

Women who have had a hysterectomy with CIN
• These women are at risk of developing vaginal intra-epithelial neoplasia (VaIN)
and invasive vaginal disease.
• For women on routine recall and with no CIN in their hysterectomy specimen,
no further vaginal vault cytology is required.
• Women not on routine recall and with no CIN in their hysterectomy specimen –
vaginal vault cytology at 6 months following hysterectomy.
• Women who undergo hysterectomy and have completely excised CIN – vaginal
vault cytology at 6 and 18 months following hysterectomy.
• For women who undergo hysterectomy and have incompletely excised CIN (or
uncertain excision), follow as if their cervix remained in situ:
* CIN 1: vault cytology at 6, 12, and 24 months.
* CIN 2/3: vault cytology at 6 and 12 months, followed by 9 annual cytology
samples.
* Follow-up for incompletely excised CIN continues to 65 years of age or
until 10 years after surgery (whichever is later).

• There is evidence of a higher prevalence of benign endometrial cells in cervical
samples taken using LBC.
• In women < 40 years of age, their presence has no significance; do not report or
act upon them.
• In women > 40 years of age, their significance varies with the phase of the
menstrual cycle, the use of some hormones, and the patient’s clinical history.
After the 14th day of the menstrual cycle, the presence of normal endometrial
cells in a cervical sample may indicate endometrial pathology except in women
who are receiving COCs, HRT, tamoxifen, or are fitted with an IUCD. In these
women, provided there are no other clinical symptoms to suggest endometrial
disease, no further clinical action is required. In the remaining women, such
cells may be associated with endometrial pathology, particularly if out of phase
or after the menopause. Refer for a gynaecological opinion.

Gynaecological oncology

Actinomyces-like organisms
• Usually seen in patients using an IUCD (including the Mirena IUS).
• If asymptomatic:
* Do not remove the coil and do not offer antibiotics.
* Perform an abdominal and pelvic examination.
* Warn regarding the small possibility of developing pelvic actinomycosis and advise to return if
she develops any symptoms.
• Do not repeat cytology unless the cervical cytology sample was inadequate or abnormal and is due
for an early repeat.
* If the asymptomatic patient wishes the device to be removed or it is due for removal, then send
it for culture.
* No follow-up is required.
• If the patient complains of specific symptoms – remove the device after ensuring that she has not
had sexual intercourse in the preceding 5 days. These symptoms include:
* Pelvic pain. * Deep dyspareunia. * Inter-menstrual bleeding (after 6 months of a device
being in situ). * Vaginal discharge, dysuria, or significant pelvic tenderness.
* Send the device for culture and advise alternative contraception. * Prescribe a course of
antibiotics (amoxicillin 250 mg TDS for two weeks, or erythromycin 500 mg TDS for two
weeks in penicillin-sensitive patients) and arrange gynaecological follow-up to ensure that the
symptoms or signs have resolved.

What not to do
• Additional cervical screening is not justified in any of the following situations, providing the
woman is in the age group to be screened and has undergone screening within the previous 3–5
years:
* On taking or starting to take an oral contraceptive.
* On insertion of an IUCD.
* On taking or starting to take HRT.
* In association with pregnancy – either antenatally or postnatally, or after termination, unless a
previous screening test was abnormal.
* In women with genital warts.
* In women with vaginal discharge.
* In women with pelvic infection.
* In women who have had multiple sexual partners.
* In women who are heavy cigarette smokers.

CHAPTER 32 Cervical cancer

Prevalence and incidence
• Cervical cancer is the second most common cancer in women worldwide. The mortality is 10
times higher in developing countries, where > 80% of new cases occur.
• It is the 19th most common cancer in the UK and constitutes 2% of all cancers in women.
• In 2010, 2851 women were diagnosed and 936 died from cervical cancer in the UK.
• Crude incidence rate – 11 new cases per 100,000 women in the UK.
• The lifetime risk of developing cervical cancer in the UK is 1/134.
• The most common cancer in women < 35 years old.
• Age-specific incidence rates – two peaks: first in women aged 30–34 years (21/100,000
women) and the second in women aged 80–84 years (14/100,000 women). The earlier peak
is related to women becoming sexually active with an increase of HPV; the second peak is
due to increasing cancer incidence with age. In the UK, about 21% of new cases were in
people aged ≥ 65 years.
• Cervical cancer mortality rates generally increase with age, with the highest number of deaths
occurring in women in their late 70s.
• Survival rate – 84% of women survive for at least one year, falling to 67% surviving five
years or more, to 63% at 10 years or more. Relative survival is higher in younger women –
five-year relative survival ranges from 89% in 15–39 year olds to 22% in 80–99 year olds.

Clinical features
• PCB, IMB, persistent/irregular vaginal bleeding, PMB.
• Abnormal and offensive vaginal discharge.
• Cervix looks or feels abnormal.
Referral to colposcopy

• Diagnosis is based on a surgical biopsy.
• If the lesion is large and clinically highly suspicious – take a directed biopsy.
• In smaller lesions – include whole lesion in the biopsy with a cone biopsy or a LLETZ.

FIGO – staging is based on clinical examination. EUA with bimanual rectovaginal palpation.
FBC, U&E, LFTs.
Endocervical curettage, hysteroscopy, cystoscopy, proctoscopy.
Chest X-ray and intravenous pyelogram.
MRI abdomen and pelvis – superior to CT scan for tumour extension assessment.
CT scan and MRI – pelvic and para-aortic nodal involvement.
PET – has sensitivity and specificity of 100% and 99%, respectively. It is still under evaluation.
Chest X-ray or thoracic CT scan for metastasis assessment.

Risk factors
• Persistent infection with high-risk HPV is responsible for virtually all cases of cervical cancer.
About 15 types of HPV are high risk for cervical cancer; HPV-16 and HPV-18 are the most
prevalent. These two types cause about 70% of cervical cancers.
• Early age at first sexual intercourse and multiple sexual partners – higher risk of acquiring
high-risk HPV.
• Other STIs – risk of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) increases by about 80% in women with
both HPV and Chlamydia infections and the risk is doubled in women with both herpes and
HPV infections.
• Risk of SCC is increased by 50% in women who smoke.
• Immunocompromised states – risk is higher than average. Women with HIV, AIDS, or on
immunosuppressants are at higher risk if they also have HPV infection.
• Risk is doubled in women who have taken the pill for at least 5 years. However, this is still
a small risk and the pill has a protective effect against endometrial and ovarian cancers. The
increased risk of cervical cancer begins to drop as soon as the pill is stopped and the risk is
the same as background risk after 10 years.
• Women with partners who have been circumcised are at lower risk.
• No evidence that pregnancy increases the risk. The risk of SCC doubles with three or more
children, compared to no children and risk of adenocarcinoma increases by 50%. Having the
first baby early, before 17 years old, also doubles the risk compared to having the first baby
at 25 years of age or older.
• Black women with HPV may have a higher risk than white women with HPV.
• Women with a first-degree relative with cervical cancer have double the risk of cervical
cancer, compared to women without a family history.
• Occupation – exposure to tetrachloroethylene used in dry cleaning and metal degreasing.
About 1% of cervical cancers in the UK are thought to be linked to this.
• Risk is higher in women with low socioeconomic background.
• Daughters of women who took diethylstilboestrol during pregnancy are more at risk of
developing cervical cancer (clear cell adenocarcinoma).

Gynaecological oncology

Staging - FIGO classification

Stage II

Stage I

Confined to the cervix.

Stage III

Tumour beyond the cervix but not to pelvic
wall or to lower third of the vagina.

• IIA without parametrial extension:
* IIA1 clinically visible lesion < 4.0 cm in
greatest dimension.
* IIA2 clinically visible lesion > 4.0 cm in
greatest dimension.

• IA:
* IA1 stromal invasion ≤ 3.0 mm
in depth and ≤ 7.0 mm in
horizontal spread.
		 Risk of positive LNs – 1%.
* IA2 stromal invasion > 3.0
mm and ≤ 5.0 mm with a
horizontal spread of ≤ 7.0 mm.
		 Risk of positive LNs – 4%.

• IIB with parametrial extension.

• IB:
Clinically visible lesion confined to cervix or
microscopic lesion > IA2.
* IB1 clinically visible lesion ≤ 4.0 cm in
greatest dimension.
* IB2 clinically visible lesion > 4.0 cm in
greatest dimension.

• Histological type – around two thirds of cervical cancers
are SCC and around 15% are adenocarcinoma; the
remainder of cases are poorly specified.
• There is an increase in relative distribution of
adenocarcinoma in developed countries owing to the
cervical screening programme.
• Adenocarcinoma has significantly lower survival rates
compared with SCC.
• Prognostic variables – tumour size, stage, nodal
involvement, lymphovascular space involvement (LVSI),
and histological subtype.
• Presence of positive pelvic lymph nodes reduces the survival
rate by 50%, stage for stage, whereas involvement of paraaortic lymph nodes reduces the survival by 75%.

Stage IV

Tumour extends to pelvic wall and/or involves lower third of the vagina and/or with
hydronephrosis or non-functioning kidney.

• IIIA tumour involvement of the
lower third of the vagina without
extension to the pelvic wall.
• IIIB tumour extension to the pelvic
wall and/ or causes hydronephrosis
or non-functioning kidney.

• IVA tumour involvement of rectal and/or
bladder mucosa and/or extends beyond true
pelvis.
• IVB distant metastasis.

http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/CBO9781316156513.033

Management

Stage IA1

• LLETZ, cone biopsy.
• Simple hysterectomy.
• In case of LVSI, pelvic lymphadenectomy
is recommended.
• In patients with at least two high-risk
factors (deep stromal invasion, LVSI, large
primary tumours) – consider postoperative
pelvic RT with or without concomitant
chemotherapy.

•
•
•
•

Stage IA2

Stage IB1

Conization or trachelectomy in young patients.
Simple or radical hysterectomy in others.
Pelvic lymphadenectomy is required.
In patients with positive margins, parametrial
involvement or pelvic node involvement –
complementary concomitant chemoradiation.

• No standard treatment. Options – surgery or radiotherapy. Both have similar
survival and recurrence rates.
• Surgery is less likely to result in impaired sexual, bowel, or bladder function.
* Radical hysterectomy, BSO, and pelvic LND.
* Radical trachelectomy – conservative fertility-sparing surgery in young
patients with good prognostic factors: tumours with largest diameter of
< 20 mm, without LVSI and without lymph node involvement. Radical
trachelectomy and lymphadenectomy – recurrence rate of < 5%. Pregnancy –
41–78% is reported.
• Radiotherapy:
* External irradiation plus brachytherapy.
* Radiation-associated morbidity – problems with vagina/sexual difficulties,
bowel, bladder dysfunction, and POF.
• Combined RT and surgery – preoperative brachytherapy followed 6–8 weeks
later by surgery. Avoid as it is associated with higher risk of complications. Postoperative RT if the resection margins or pelvic lymph nodes are involved.
• Positive LN on MRI/staging LN dissection – chemoradiotherapy.

Stage IB2–IVA

• Concomitant chemoradiotherapy – superior to RT alone for local control, metastasis rate, disease-free
and overall survival.
• Patients with stage IB2–IIA/B may benefit more from chemoradiotherapy than patients with stage III
and IVA.
• Non-platinum-based regimens for chemoradiation are as efficient as platinum-based chemotherapy.
However, the most common regimen is cisplatin monotherapy.
• Chemoradiotherapy increases acute toxicity, particularly gastrointestinal and haematological side
effects. Data on late effects of this combined treatment are not available.
• Role of adjuvant chemotherapy after concomitant chemoradiation is unclear.
• Do not use recombinant human erythropoietin owing to the risk of thromboembolic events.
• External irradiation is combined with brachytherapy and the total treatment duration should remain
<55 days. MRI 3D-based brachytherapy seems to improve local control.
• Complementary extra-fascial hysterectomy after radiotherapy can be considered for patients with
persistent disease.
• Neoadjuvant chemotherapy remains controversial.

171

If no evidence of tumour at the margins and stage IA disease –
manage at cancer unit.
Higher stage of disease – refer to cancer centre.

Stage IVB

• Platinum-based combination chemotherapy.

• Regional and metastatic recurrence.

• Palliative chemotherapy is the standard.
• Pelvic exenteration in selected cases of central pelvic recurrence. Major impact
on psychological, social, and sexual function.
• Salvage radiotherapy.

Follow-up strategy – unclear
• Every 3 months for the first 2 years; every 6 months for the next 3 years, and yearly
thereafter.
• Clinical examination (speculum and bimanual examination) including PAP smear.
• Suspected recurrence – EUA, biopsy, MRI, PET/CT might have a role in early local
recurrence and metastasis detection.
• UK – majority of the patients are followed up for up to 5 years and then discharged.
• Cervical cytology – if there is high suspicion of residual VaIN.

• Biopsy may be associated with severe bleeding.
• Colposcopic appearance may be atypical, therefore refer to experienced colposcopist.
• MRI to assess the extent.
• Pregnancy does not adversely affect the outcome of cervical cancer.
• Treatment – same as in non-pregnant women.
• Viable fetus – radical hysterectomy can be performed at the time of Caesarean section.
At < 20 weeks – radical hysterectomy could be performed without prior induction of
abortion.

CHAPTER 33 Endometrial hyperplasia

Background and pathogenesis

Risk factors

• Excessive cellular proliferation leads to an increased volume of endometrial tissue, where
an increase of endometrial glands to stroma is seen at a ratio of > 1:1.
• There is risk of progression to endometrial carcinoma when hyperplasia is associated with
cytological atypia.
• Majority of endometrial cancers (except serous, clear cell, and some endometrioid-type
adenocarcinomas) follow a continuum from endometrial hyperplasia without atypia, to
endometrial hyperplasia with atypia, to well-differentiated endometrial carcinoma.
• Categorized into simple and complex, based on the complexity and crowding of the
glandular architecture.
• Some cases regress spontaneously.
• Most hyperplasias without atypia represent early, highly reversible lesions, and atypical
endometrial hyperplasia is a precursor of endometrioid endometrial cancer.
• Atypical endometrial hyperplasia is considered as a pre-malignant lesion of the
endometrium and redefined as endometrial intra-epithelial neoplasia (EIN).
• EIN lesions have an increased risk of developing carcinoma and require treatment.
• EIN classification:
* Simple (cystic) and complex (adenomatous) endometrial hyperplasia without atypia –
endometrial hyperplasia
* Atypical endometrial hyperplasia – EIN.

Clinical features
• Abnormal uterine bleeding – menorrhagia, IMB, PMB, irregular bleeding on HRT or
tamoxifen.
• Asymptomatic.

• A relative excess of oestrogen, exogenous or endogenous, compared with progesterone.
• Seen in both pre-menopausal and post-menopausal women (approximately 15% of cases of
women presenting with PMB).
• Post-menopausal women treated with supplemental oestrogens are at increased risk if a
progestin is not used to oppose the proliferative actions of oestrogen on the endometrium. The
risk increases with dose and duration of treatment with a 10-fold increased risk associated with
each decade of use.
• Other risk factors – obesity, nulliparity, diabetes, and hypertension.
• PCOS – owing to unopposed oestrogenic stimulation secondary to anovulation.
• Women with hereditary non-polyposis colonic cancer (HNPCC) develop complex atypical
endometrial hyperplasia at an earlier age.
• Peripheral conversion of androgens to oestrogens in androgen-secreting tumours of the adrenal
cortex (rare).
• Tamoxifen has a partial agonist effect and can induce a proliferative effect on the endometrium,
the increased risk persisting after cessation of treatment; 16% of women treated with tamoxifen
developed atypical hyperplasia and 39% developed abnormal endometrial histology.

Routine screening for women at high risk of endometrial hyperplasia has not proven efficacious or
cost-effective.

Investigations (See Chapter 35)
• Blind endometrial biopsy using the Pipelle, Vabra aspirator, and endometrial lavage:
* Pipelle biopsy – highest sensitivity (81%); sensitivity of Vabra (67%) and endometrial lavage (53%).
* Specificity of all three is high (>98%).
* Failure rate of 3% and an inadequate specimen rate of 1.5%.
• Pipelle vs curette – both are blind techniques and they do not sample the entire endometrial cavity. Associated with 96% agreement between biopsy pathology and final diagnosis for both procedures.
• Hysteroscopy – gold standard. It allows the whole surface of the endometrium to be visualized, but performed alone has a high false-positive rate. Hysteroscopy with targeted biopsy has best
sensitivity and specificity and is superior to hysteroscopy, dilatation and curettage, or endometrial biopsy performed alone.
• TVS – see Chapter 35.
• Sonohysterography and Pipelle biopsy – sensitivity (94%) comparable to those of hysteroscopy and dilatation and curettage.

Simple hyperplasia

Complex atypical hyperplasia

Complex hyperplasia

Risk of progression

•
•
•
•

Majority spontaneously regress.
18% persist.
3% progress to complex atypical hyperplasia.
1% progress to endometrial adenocarcinoma.

•
•
•
•

Majority regress spontaneously.
22% persist.
4% progress to endometrial carcinoma.
Mean duration to progression of
approximately 10 years.

• Progress in 29% of cases, with a mean duration to progression of 4 years.
• Risk of concomitant carcinoma is reported as up to 50% in recent studies.
• Endometrial carcinomas with concomitant hyperplasia are thought to be
associated with less aggressive disease, tending to be of lower grade and stage with
significantly lower recurrence risk and higher 5-year survival rates.
• However, a study reported – 37.5% of women with concomitant atypical
hyperplasia had endometrial carcinoma with FIGO stage IB or higher.

Treatment

• Conservative – persistent or
progressive disease is seen in one third
of conservatively managed cases.
• Progestogens:
* Have both indirect anti-oestrogenic
and direct antiproliferative effects
on the endometrium.
* Route – systemically, either alone
or in combination with oestrogen
(COC or HRT), or locally in the
form of LNG-IUS. Both routes
have a 75–90% and 90–100%
conversion rate of non-atypical
endometrial hyperplasia to normal
endometrium, respectively.

• Surgical:
* In the presence of persistent symptoms or
non-regressive disease, hysterectomy is
appropriate.

• Progestogen:
* In women < 40 years – 94% success
rate with 3–18 months of therapy;
subsequent successful pregnancies
are reported.
* In post-menopausal women, a 25%
risk of progression to carcinoma is
reported in those treated with MPA.
* Re-sample the endometrium after
suitable therapeutic intervals (3–6
months) to ensure that hormonal
ablation has occurred.

1. Palmer JE, Perunovic B, Tidy JA. Endometrial hyperplasia. The Obstetrician and Gynaecologist 2008;10:211–216.

• Surgical:
* Where fertility or significant surgical risk
is not an issue – hysterectomy in view
of the risk of coexisting malignancy or
progression to cancer.
* Because of the risk of concomitant
endometrial carcinoma and the
possibility of it being of higher stage in
some cases, evaluate women carefully for
the possibility of more advanced disease
prior to surgery.

CHAPTER 34 Endometrial cancer

Prevalence and incidence
•
•
•
•
•

Most common gynaecological malignancy in the developed world/UK.
UK 2010 – 8288 women were diagnosed and 1937 died from uterine cancer.
The 4th most common cancer in women in the UK (5% of all female cancers).
Lifetime risk of developing uterine cancer in the UK – 1/46 women.
Age – more common in post-menopausal women (PMW). Median age of occurrence is
63 years; > 90% of women are older than 50 years.
• Incidence rises from 2/100,000 women/year in women < 40 years of age to 40–50/100,000
among women aged 60–89 years.
• Survival rate – 90% of women survive for at least 1 year; 77% survive 5 years or more; 75%
survive up to 10 years.
Stage – 5-year survival is around 85% for stage I tumours, compared with 25% for stage IV.
	Grade – 81% 5-year survival in grade 1, stage IC tumours compared with 42% for grade
3 ­tumours of the same stage.

History
• Post-menopausal women – PMB, persistent/abnormal vaginal discharge.
• 25% of cases present in peri-menopausal women – irregular bleeding, IMB, PCB.
• Examination, investigations, and referral for PMB/abnormal bleeding in peri-menopausal
women – see Chapter 35.
Refer all PMB and women aged > 45 years with abnormal uterine bleeding for assessment at a
local cancer unit. (NICE)

Investigations – preoperative evaluation for staging

Risk factors
Increase risk with:
• Increased endogenous hormones:
* Excess exposure to oestrogen unopposed by progestogens.
* Insulin and insulin-like growth factors increase the effect of oestrogen on uterine tissue.
* PMW – high circulating levels of unopposed oestrogens and androgens.
* Early menarche and late menopause owing to prolonged years of oestrogen exposure.
* Amenorrhoea, infrequent or irregular periods (PCOS), anovulatory menstrual cycles.
• Obesity – risk is 2 to 3 times higher in overweight and obese women.
• Exogenous hormones:
* UK Million Women study – increased risk of 50% among current users of oestrogen-only
HRT and 80% in those using tibolone preparations.
* Tamoxifen – trebles the risk of uterine cancer. This does not appear to be dose dependent,
although the risk increases with duration of therapy. Excess deaths from uterine cancer
among women taking tamoxifen are about 2/10,000 women each year.
• Diabetes – doubles the risk, with an independent effect owing to circulating insulin and free
insulin-like growth factor 1.
• Hereditary – HNPCC accounts for < 5% of all endometrial cancer (See Chapter 37).

Reduced risk with:
• COCs – 6% reduction in risk for each year of use, due to fewer days of unopposed oestrogen
exposure each month. The risk reduction persists for up to 20 years after stopping use.
• Women with high levels of sex hormone-binding globulin (which governs the bioavailability
of oestrogens and androgens).
• Pregnancy and parity – reduces risk by 30% for a woman’s first birth and by 25% for each
successive birth. Older age at last birth has also been shown to reduce risk.
• Physical activity – most active women have a 23% reduction in risk.
• Aspirin – a meta-analysis reported a 13% risk reduction for any aspirin use with a stronger
association for women who are obese (28% risk reduction); it may not benefit women who
have a healthy weight.

• History, clinical examination, and endometrial biopsy.
• FBC, RFT, LFT, chest X-ray, ECG.
• TVS – has sensitivity of 66–86% and specificity of 83–90% to detect tumour invasion
extending through > half of myometrium.
• MRI – best for defining myometrial spread. Absence of MRI evidence of deep myometrial
penetration has a high NPV, but presence of MRI evidence of deep penetration has a lower
PPV.
• If cervical involvement is suspected – contrast-enhanced dynamic MRI.
• CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis – for extra-uterine and extra-pelvic spread.
• PET – to determine location of disease recurrence.
Screening

There is no screening test that is accurate and reliable enough to detect uterine cancer in the general
population.

SECTION 6

Gynaecological oncology

FIGO Stage, 2009

Stage I

Stage II

Stage III

Confined to the corpus uteri.

Tumour invades cervical stroma but
does not extend beyond the uterus.

Local and/or regional spread.

• IA – no invasion or < 50% of the
myometrium.
• IB – invasion ≥ 50% of the myometrium.
• 5-year survival – 85%.
• Pelvic lymph node (PLN) involvement for
Stage IA: 5%, IB: 10%.

• 5-year survival – 75%.
• PLN involvement is 20%.

Histological types

• IIIA – tumour invades serosa of the corpus
uteri and/or adnexae.
• IIIB – vaginal and/or parametrial
involvement.
• IIIC1 – positive PLNs.
• IIIC2 – positive para-aortic lymph nodes
with or without PLNs.
• 5-year survival – 45%.
• PLN involvement is 55%.

Stage IV
Tumour invades bladder/bowel
­ ucosa, and/or distant metastases.
m

• IVA – tumour invasion of bladder and/or
bowel mucosa.
• IVB – distant metastases including intraabdominal and/or inguinal lymph nodes.
• 5-year survival – 25%.

• Endometrioid (75%) – most common, composed of malignant glandular epithelial
elements.
• Adenocarcinoma with squamous differentiation.
• Adenoacanthoma (benign squamous component).
• Adenosquamous (malignant squamous component).
• Uterine papillary serous (5%–10%).
• Clear cell (1%–5%).
• Malignant mixed Müllerian tumours or carcinosarcomas (1–2%).
• Uterine sarcomas (leiomyosarcoma, undifferentiated) (3%).
• Mucinous (1%).
• Undifferentiated.

Type 1 and Type 2 categories
Based on histopathology, molecular profile, and clinical course, endometrial cancers are
divided into two categories.
• Type 1 – a slow-growing, low-grade (I–II) adenocarcinoma linked to oestrogen and
obesity through the peripheral conversion of androstenedione to oestrone in body fat.
* Diagnosed early and has a favourable prognosis. * Accounts for 80% of cases.
• Type 2 – more aggressive, faster growing, unrelated to oestrogen. * Usually grade
III endometrioid adenocarcinomas, papillary serous and clear cell carcinomas, and
carcinosarcomas.
* Approximately 10% of cases. * They have p53 mutations and loss of heterozygosity
at several chromosomal loci.
* Prognosis is less favourable and presentation can occur at a more advanced stage.
• Endometrioid carcinoma is thought to progress through a pre-malignant stage of
complex atypical hyperplasia in most cases, whereas papillary serous and clear-cell
carcinomas arise as a result of a sequence of genetic mutations.

Management
• Women with stage IA, Grade 1 or 2 (40% of cases) – treat at the cancer unit.
• Women with more advanced or high-risk cancers (stage I, Grade 3, stage IB, or higher), or those
with morphological or other features associated with poor prognosis – treat at cancer centres.

Stage I

Stage II

• TAH/BSO – open or laparoscopic.
• Inspect and palpate liver, diaphragm, omentum, and
peritoneal surfaces. Take peritoneal washings.
• A pelvic/para-aortic lymph node dissection (LND):
* Ongoing debate. It may increase the risk of
lymphoedema without a clear benefit.
* RCT of LND and adjuvant external beam
radiotherapy (MRC, NCRI, UK) – no evidence
of benefit on overall survival or recurrence-free
survival for pelvic LND in women with early
endometrial cancer, and it is not recommended.

Intra-abdominal disease

• Suspected cervical involvement (MRI or cervical biopsy) –
radical TAH/ BSO and consider pelvic/para-aortic lymph
node dissection (LND). If adequate surgical margins are
achieved and the nodes are free of disease – adjuvant RT is
not indicated.
• Medically inoperable stage I/II (co-morbidities such as
obesity, cardiac morbidity, diabetes) – may be treated by
external beam radiotherapy (RT) and/or brachytherapy
(BT).

• Intra-abdominal disease (omental, nodal, ovarian, peritoneal
involvement, ascites) – TAH/BSO and consider maximal
surgical debulking.
Distant metastatic disease

• Distant metastatic disease (e.g., liver, lung) – consider palliative
hysterectomy depending on patient’s status, expected benefits,
and MDT decision. Surgery may be followed by pelvic RT and/
or chemotherapy.

Adjuvant treatment – controversial, with lack of clear evidence

Stage I

• Stage IA, G1–2
* Observation.
• Stage IA, G3
* Consider vaginal BT, depending
on coexisting risk factors.
* If LVSI and positive LN/no
LND – consider pelvic RT.

177

Stage II

• Stage IB, G1–2
* Observation or vaginal BT.
* Pelvic RT as in Stage IA, G3.
• Stage IB, G3
* Vaginal BT alone.
* Or pelvic RT as in Stage IA,
G3.
• Consider chemotherapy for highgrade cases.

• Consider both pelvic RT and
vaginal BT.
• GI tumour – without LVSI and/
or negative pelvic nodes after
LND – vaginal BT alone.
• High-grade (G3) – adjuvant
chemotherapy may reduce the
rate of distant recurrences.
Therefore, consider
chemotherapy.

Stage III and IV

• Maximal surgical cytoreduction for patients without
co-morbidities.
• Approach Stage III with curative intent.
* Observation only could be an option for non-invasive grade
1–2, confined to the fundus with only positive cytology
(stage IIIA with the old staging).
* All other stage III tumours – pelvic RT with vaginal BT.
* Adjuvant chemotherapy may reduce the distant recurrences.
Therefore, consider chemotherapy for stage III high-grade
tumours, particularly those with PLN disease.
• Neoadjuvant chemotherapy can be considered for advanced
tumours, followed by surgery.
• Consider pelvic RT either to palliate symptoms or as a highdose palliative RT if it could offer a longer symptom-free
interval.

SECTION 6

Gynaecological oncology

Follow-up for recurrence
• Overall recurrence rate is 7–18%.
• There is lack of evidence for clear benefit and follow-up schedules. For the first 3 years,
patients can be seen 3–4 times monthly. For the next 2 years, 6-monthly appointments are
recommended.
• Assess – history, physical and vaginal examination.
• Symptoms of recurrence include vaginal bleeding, discharge, pressure symptoms.
• Investigate further (CT, MRI, blood tests, EUA) if clinically indicated.
• Management of recurrence depends on the sites of recurrence and previous treatment.
• Pelvic recurrence for RT–treated women who have not been exposed to previous radiation
with RT. Surgery is an option for previously irradiated women with vaginal vault recurrence.
• During this surveillance, take into account the increased risk of cancers of the breast, ovary,
and colon in patients with endometrial cancer.

• Hormonal treatment with high-dose oral progestogens is the main
treatment in cases of multiple or distant recurrences.
• GnRH analogue is an option in progesterone refractory cases.
• Chemotherapy may be used with palliative intent.

Papillary serous and clear cell carcinomas

• No definite evidence.
• Adjuvant therapy recommendations:
* Stage IA – observation or chemotherapy or pelvic RT.
* Stage IB II – chemotherapy with or without pelvic RT, with or without
vaginal BT (especially in cervical stromal invasion).
* Stage III IV – adequately debulked: chemotherapy and pelvic RT with
or without vaginal BT (especially if there is cervical stromal invasion).
Consider chemotherapy in inadequately debulked stage III or IV
patients.

CHAPTER 35 Post-menopausal bleeding

Background and incidence
•
•
•
•

History/risk factors

Episode of bleeding 12 months or more after the last period.
Incidence – 14.3/1000 post-menopausal women (PMW).
Endometrial cancer is present in approximately 10% of PMB.
Other causes of PMB – cervical cancer, endometrial polyp, benign conditions of vulva and vagina.

Single/multiple episodes of bleeding – no evidence of whether different patterns of
PMB are more or less likely to be associated with endometrial cancer.

Age

HRT

Tamoxifen

• Incidence of PMB decreases with age,
but the probability of endometrial
cancer increases.
• Risk of endometrial cancer:
* Women up to 60 years – 10%.
* Women > 60 years – 13%.

• PMB in HRT users is less likely to be associated with endometrial
cancer than in non-HRT users.
• Non-users of HRT – risk of endometrial cancer is 6–12%.
• Users of HRT (combined) – risk of endometrial cancer is 1%.
• HRT with unopposed oestrogen increases the RR of endometrial
cancer 6 times after 5 years of use.
• Risk for women on continuous combined HRT is similar to those
not on HRT.
• Women on sequential HRT tend to have a thicker endometrium;
thus a higher threshold needs to be used for identifying those with a
significant probability of cancer.

• Probability of endometrial cancer is substantially greater
than 10%. They have a 3–6-fold greater incidence of
endometrial cancer.
• Risk rises with both the use of higher doses and
increasing duration of tamoxifen.
• Use beyond 5 years increases risk by at least 4-fold.
• Endometrial cancer in long-term users of tamoxifen has
a poorer prognosis (due to less favourable histology and
higher stage).

Hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC)

Others – current evidence is insufficient to quantify the risk in:
• Obese patients with diabetes.
• Women with HT.
• Past history of hyper-oestrogenism (endogenous or exogenous) such as women
with early menarche and late menopause.

• Autosomal dominant.
• Familial aggregation of colorectal cancer and extra-colonic cancers of which endometrial
cancer is the most common.
• Lifetime risk of endometrial cancer is 42–60%.
• Usually develops pre-menopausally.

Examination
Full pelvic examination and speculum examination of the cervix to rule out any local pathology. (NICE)

Refer urgently to secondary care – women with PMB who are:

• Not on HRT.
• On HRT with persistent or unexplained PMB after cessation of HRT for 6/52.
• Taking tamoxifen. (NICE)

SECTION 6

Gynaecological oncology

Further assessment
Women on no HRT

Women on HRT

Women on tamoxifen

• Rule out poor compliance, especially related to omission of progestogens;
poor gastrointestinal absorption, e.g., due to gastroenteritis; drug
interactions; coagulation defects; gynaecological disorders.
• Use of HRT generally leads to thickening of the endometrial lining, whereas
continuous combined HRT and tibolone cause endometrial atrophy.
• Whether to stop HRT prior to investigation may depend on the patient’s
wishes but there is no specific reason for discontinuing it. (SIGN)

• Periodic investigations (USS, hysteroscopy, endometrial biopsy) are
not cost-effective in asymptomatic women. PMB is the primary
trigger for investigation of women on tamoxifen. (SIGN)
• USS is poor at differentiating potential cancers from other
tamoxifen-induced thickening because of the distorted endometrial
architecture associated with long-term use of tamoxifen.
• Hysteroscopy with biopsy is the first line of investigation.

Investigations – screening with imaging

Transabdominal USS

Transvaginal USS

Others

• If the uterus is significantly enlarged or
a wider view of the pelvis or abdomen is
required.
• In women in whom it is technically
impossible to perform a transvaginal USS.

• Improved resolution, allows more accurate
ET measurement and better assessment of
endometrial morphology.
• Lack of dependency upon a full bladder.
• Improved access to the retroverted uterus.
• Better assessment in obese patients.

Screening with ET on TVS

The mean ET in women on sequential HRT with PMB is greater than in those who are not on sequential HRT. Thus, an abnormal ET in women
with PMB who are not using sequential HRT represents a greater probability of endometrial disease than in women taking HRT.
• Never used HRT.
• Not used HRT for over 1 year.
• On continuous combined HRT.

Histology

Dilatation and curettage – involves curetting the
walls of the uterine cavity in a systematic fashion.
• Blind technique and lesions may be missed in up
to 10% of cases.
• Do not use D&C as the first-line method of
investigating PMB.

Outpatient endometrial samplers:

Hysteroscopy:

• The ‘negative’ pressure permits aspiration of tissue
into the device.
• It may reduce inconvenience, anxiety, risk for the
patient and costs for the hospital.
• It has a procedure failure rate and a tissue-yield
failure rate, each of approximately 10%.

• Allows visualization of the endometrial cavity directly. It is
the gold standard, even though the evidence base is poor.
• Preferred diagnostic technique to detect polyps and other
benign lesions.
• Histological specimens – either with curettage or with
endometrium sampling device, e.g., Pipelle.

Service provision

• Outpatient hysteroscopy and facilities to perform hysteroscopy and
curettage under GA should be available in all diagnostic clinics.
• ‘One stop’ specialist clinics.

Outpatient – accuracy and patient
acceptability equivalent to inpatient
hysteroscopy under GA.

Under general anaesthesia – when the
outpatient procedure is not possible or the
patient has a strong preference for a GA.

Further investigations

• If the clinician or patient is not satisfied with this level of reassurance.
• Or recurrent PMB – there is no evidence to recommend when a re-investigation should take place. Consider it after 6 months.

Guideline comparator
What not to do
• Transvaginal Doppler USS, 3D USS,
saline enhanced transvaginal USS,
and endometrial texture and margin
analysis.
• D&C as the first-line method of
investigating PMB.

SOGC

ACOG

• Outpatient endometrial biopsy is the initial diagnostic procedure of choice because of
its convenience, accuracy, availability, safety, and low cost.
• If an outpatient endometrial biopsy cannot be performed or the sample is insufficient,
then triage the patients according to their risk for endometrial cancer. Those at low
risk, in whom atrophy is suspected, or who are medically unfit – investigate with TVS.
Those at high risk (obese, nulliparous, diabetic, on tamoxifen) – perform D&C, with
or without hysteroscopy, as a negative TVS is not necessarily completely reassuring
and a positive TVS would require tissue sampling regardless.
• There is no consensus in the literature as to what the cut-off value for normal ET
should be. It has been reported as anywhere from 4–8 mm.
• Investigate if persistent bleeding after negative initial evaluation, because at least 10%
of patients will harbour disease.
• Patients taking continuous combined HRT who experience vaginal bleeding after the
first 6 months of therapy or patients on sequential HRT who experience bleeding
outside the expected time, i.e., after completing their progesterone – investigate with an
endometrial biopsy.

• Assess initially with either TVS or
endometrial biopsy. No need to do both.
• Inadequate sample on endometrial
biopsy – further assessment with TVS.
• TVS – if ET is < 4 mm – endometrial
sampling is not necessary.
• ET > 4 mm, or inability to adequately
visualize the ET – further evaluate
with sonohysterography, outpatient
hysteroscopy, or endometrial biopsy.

Asymptomatic endometrial thickening in post-menopausal women (SOGC)

What to do
• A woman who has increased ET and other positive findings on TVS, such as increased
vascularity, heterogeneity of endometrium, particulate fluid, or thickened endometrium
> 11 mm – investigate further.
• Decide about further investigations on an individual basis in asymptomatic women with
increased ET and risk factors for endometrial cancer such as obesity, hypertension, and
late menopause.
• Not all PMW who have asymptomatic endometrial polyps require surgery. Triage these
women found to have asymptomatic polyps on USS for intervention according to size of
the polyp, age, and other risk factors.

What not to do
• Do not use TVS as screening tool for endometrial cancer.
• Do not routinely perform endometrial sampling in a PMW without bleeding.
• Indications for tissue sampling of the endometrium in bleeding PMW with an ET
of > 4–5 mm should not be extrapolated to asymptomatic women.
• In asymptomatic women on tamoxifen, do not perform a routine USS for ET.
• Significance of raised ET in asymptomatic PMW is not established; do not routinely start
investigation. (ACOG)

CHAPTER 36 Ovarian cyst

Background and prevalence
• Ovarian cysts are fluid-containing structures more than 30 mm in diameter.
• Up to 4% of women (median age 26 years), have an ovarian cyst > 30 mm in diameter in the
luteal phase.
• Risk of malignancy increases with increasing tumour size and increasing age.
• Up to 10% of women have some form of surgery during their lifetime for an ovarian mass.
• In pre-menopausal women, almost all ovarian masses and cysts are benign.
• Overall incidence of a symptomatic ovarian cyst in a pre-menopausal women being
malignant is approximately 1/1000, increasing to 3/1000 at the age of 50 years.
• Incidence of malignant ovarian cysts in the reproductive age group is 0.4–9/100,000 women;
and in women aged 60–80 years is 60/100,000.
• In post-menopausal women, 21% of the cysts have abnormal ovarian morphology, either
simple or complex.

History
• Take a detailed history along with risk factors or protective factors for ovarian malignancy
and a family history of ovarian or breast cancer.
• Symptoms suggestive of endometriosis.
• Symptoms suggestive of ovarian malignancy – abdominal distension, appetite change
including increased satiety, pelvic or abdominal pain, increased urinary urgency and/or
frequency.
• Acute pain – consider ovarian accident (torsion, rupture, haemorrhage).

• Evaluation of ovarian masses – to exclude malignancy and to decide when to refer to
a gynaecological oncologist.
• General presentation
Peri-menopausal woman:
* Incidental finding.
* Acute presentation with pain.
* Symptoms of endometriosis.
Post-menopausal women:
* Result of screening.
* Investigations for a suspected pelvic mass.
* Incidental finding.

Differential diagnosis – adnexal masses
• Benign ovarian mass – functional cysts, endometriomas, benign tumours.
• Benign non-ovarian mass – paratubal cyst, hydrosalpinges, tubo-ovarian
abscess, peritoneal pseudocysts, appendiceal abscess, diverticular abscess, pelvic
kidney.
• Primary malignant ovarian tumour.
• Secondary malignant ovarian tumour – breast and gastrointestinal carcinoma.

Examination
• Abdominal and vaginal examination – a large ovarian cyst
may be palpable as a mass arising from the pelvis, separate
from the uterus. Small cysts are often missed. Although
clinical examination has poor sensitivity in the detection
of ovarian masses (15–51%), it helps to evaluate mass
tenderness, mobility, nodularity, and ascites.
• Assess for local lymphadenopathy and ascites.

SECTION 6

Gynaecological oncology

Investigations

Tumour markers
Serum CA125

• It is raised in > 80% of ovarian cancer cases (epithelial cancer).
However, it is raised in only 50% of stage I cases.
• With a cut-off of 30 units/ml, it has sensitivity of 81% and
specificity of 75%.
• It is not specific for ovarian cancer as it may also be raised in
benign conditions – fibroids, endometriosis, adenomyosis, benign
cysts, and in many other malignancies.
• It is unreliable in differentiating benign from malignant ovarian
masses in pre-menopausal women because of the increased rate of
false positives and reduced specificity.
Serum CA125 in peri-menopausal women

• Do not request when a clear USS diagnosis of a simple ovarian cyst
has been made.
• Raised and < 200 units/ml – further investigation may be
appropriate to exclude/treat the common differential diagnoses.
• Raised – serial monitoring of CA125 may be helpful as rapidly
rising levels are more likely to be associated with malignancy.
• > 200 units/ml – discuss with a gynaecological oncologist.

Ultrasound scan

MRI, CT

• TVS – greater sensitivity and provides more details than TAS.
Larger masses may need to be assessed by TAS as well.
• Sonographic features suggestive of ovarian malignancy
include larger size, presence of septations, papillary
formations, echogenic solid areas, and free fluid in the pouch
of Douglas.
• TVS – a sensitivity of 89% and specificity of 73% with the
use of morphology index. However, specificity of TVS for the
detection of malignancy is not sufficiently high for it to be
used alone as a screening test.
• Use of colour flow Doppler does not significantly improve
diagnostic accuracy but the combined use of TVS with colour
flow mapping and 3D imaging may improve sensitivity.
• Doppler ultrasound assessment of cyst wall blood flow does
not differentiate between benign and malignant ovarian cysts.
This is probably because of the presence of neoangiogenesis
in both malignant and functional tumours.
• No single ultrasound finding differentiates categorically
between benign and malignant ovarian masses.

• MRI, CT, PET) – role yet to be established.
• MRI may be superior to CT and USS in diagnosis
and staging of ovarian mass.
• TVS has greater sensitivity than either MRI or
PET in distinguishing benign from malignant
disease, at the expense of some specificity.
• Owing to the lack of clear evidence of benefit, the
relative expense, and limited availability of these
modalities, their routine use is not recommended.

Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), -AFP, and hCG
In all women under age of 40 years with a complex ovarian mass
because of the possibility of germ cell tumours.

Estimate the risk of malignancy

Risk of malignancy index (RMI)

International Ovarian Tumor Analysis (IOTA) Group

• Combines sonographic findings, menopausal status, and serum
CA125 levels to provide an estimate of the risk of malignancy.
• With a cut-off point of 250 units/ml, sensitivity is 70% and specificity
is 90%.
• RMI = U × M × CA125.
• U = 0 (USS score of 0), U = 1 (USS score of 1), U = 3 (USS score of
2–5).
• USS are scored one point for each of the following characteristics:
multilocular cyst, evidence of solid areas, evidence of metastases,
presence of ascites, bilateral lesions.
• M = 3 for all post-menopausal women, 1 for pre-menopausal women.
• CA125 is serum CA125 measurement in units/ml.

• To estimate risk of malignancy in pre-menopausal women without using CA125. The use of specific ultrasound
morphological findings without CA125 has high sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratios. Classify masses as benign
(B-rules) or malignant (M-rules).
• B-rules – unilocular cysts, presence of solid components where the largest solid component < 7 mm, presence of
acoustic shadows, smooth multi-locular tumour with a largest diameter < 100 mm, no blood flow.
• M-rules – irregular solid tumour, ascites, at least four papillary structures, irregular multi-locular solid tumour with
largest diameter ≥100 mm, very strong blood flow.
• Using these rules, the sensitivity is 95%, specificity 91%, positive likelihood ratio 10, and negative likelihood ratio
0.06.
• Refer women with an ovarian mass with any of the M-rules ultrasound findings to a gynaecological oncologist.

Management in post-menopausal women – based on RMI

Low risk

•
•
•
•
•

Moderate risk

RMI < 25.
40% of PMW.
< 3% risk of cancer.
Manage in a gynaecology unit by a general gynaecologist.
The risk of malignancy of cysts that are < 5 cm, unilateral,
unilocular, and echo-free with no solid parts or papillary
formations, is < 1%. More than 50% of these cysts will resolve
spontaneously within 3 months.
• Conservative management for simple cysts < 5 cm in diameter
with a serum CA125 level of < 30 units/ml. Repeat USS and
serum CA125 every 4 months for one year.
• If the cyst does not fit the above criteria or if the woman requests
surgery – laparoscopic oophorectomy.

If malignancy is discovered

Surgical management in post-menopausal women

Aspiration

• Do not aspirate the cyst.
• Cytology of ovarian cyst fluid is poor at
distinguishing between benign and malignant
tumours with sensitivity of 25%, false-positive rate
of 73%, and false-negative rate of 12 %.
• Cyst aspiration can lead to dissemination of
malignant cells and has unfavourable impact on
disease-free survival.

Laparotomy – TAH, BSO, and full staging

Laparoscopic oophorectomy

• To exclude an ovarian malignancy in women who are
not eligible for conservative management but still have
a relatively low risk of malignancy.
• Undertake laparoscopic oophorectomy (usually
bilateral) rather than cystectomy with removal of the
ovary intact in a bag without cyst rupture into the
peritoneal cavity, even when the risk of malignancy is
low.

• If an ovarian malignancy is suspected.
• Laparotomy through an extended midline incision and:
cytology of ascites or washings; biopsies from adhesions
and suspicious areas; TAH, BSO, and infra-colic
omentectomy. May need bilateral selective pelvic and
para-aortic lymphadenectomy.

If a malignancy is revealed – refer urgently to a cancer centre for further management.

SECTION 6

Gynaecological oncology

Management in pre-menopausal women

Expectant

• Small (< 50 mm diameter) simple ovarian cysts – do not require
follow-up as these cysts are very likely to be physiological and
almost always resolve within 3 menstrual cycles.
• Simple ovarian cysts of 50–70 mm in diameter – follow-up yearly
with USS.

Surgical management

Medical management

• Cochrane review – use of the COCs does
not promote the resolution of functional
ovarian cysts.
• Hormonal suppression, with the COCs,
may be useful in young women who
develop recurrent painful functional cysts
in the ovaries.

• Simple ovarian cysts of > 70 mm in diameter – consider
for either further imaging (MRI) or surgical intervention,
owing to difficulties in examining the entire cyst adequately
with USS.
• Surgically manage ovarian cysts that persist or increase
in size as they are unlikely to be functional. There is no
consensus on the size above which surgery is indicated.
Most studies have used an arbitrary maximum diameter of
50–60 mm to offer conservative management.
• Appropriate route for the surgical management depends
on – the woman (suitability for laparoscopy and her
wishes), the mass (size, complexity, likely nature), and the
setting (surgeon’s skills and equipment).

Cyst aspiration

Cystotomy

Cystectomy

• Transvaginal USS-guided or laparoscopic.
• It is associated with a high rate of
recurrence of 53%–84%.
• Aspiration is not superior to regular
observation.
• Consider cyst aspiration:
* Treatment of a simple cyst during
ovulation induction for treatment of
infertility.
* In women with symptomatic cysts
who are at high risk of medical
complications of anaesthesia.

• Cystotomy and stripping of cyst wall – the
cyst is opened and the internal cyst wall
is stripped away from the underlying
stroma. There is a higher chance of
bleeding from the stripped site and
damage to adjacent primordial follicles
with possible compromise of ovarian
function and higher incidence of adhesion
formation.
• Cystotomy and ablation of cyst wall –
the cyst is first aspirated then opened
sufficiently to admit a diathermy or
laser. The cyst wall is then destroyed. A
proportion of ovarian follicles will be lost
due to thermal injury. Consider this if
the cyst lining seems more adherent and
vascular.

• Removal of the cyst intact. The resulting
defect may either be closed with sutures,
treated with bipolar cautery, or left open
to heal. No method is superior in terms
of healing and postoperative adhesion
formation.
• It is the preferred method of treatment of:
* Dermoid cysts, in order to avoid
intraperitoneal spillage of cyst content.
* If there is a low but possible chance of
malignancy in a young woman wishing
to preserve her fertility.

Oophorectomy

• Preoperatively discuss the possibility of
removing the ovary.
• Oophorectomy may be necessary if the
ovary is grossly distorted with multiple
endometriomas with complete loss of
normal ovarian tissue.

Surgical management (contd.)

Laparotomy and staging

Laparoscopy

• It is associated with lower postoperative pain, fewer postoperative complications, and shorter
recovery time. It is preferred to laparotomy in suitable patients. It is also cost-effective because
of earlier discharge and return to work.
• Avoid unplanned rupture of the cyst to avoid spillage of cyst contents because:
* The apparently benign characteristics of a cyst on preoperative and intraoperative assessment
cannot absolutely preclude malignancy.
* Chemical peritonitis owing to spillage of dermoid cyst contents occurs in < 0.2% of cases.
• Consider using a tissue bag to avoid peritoneal spill of cystic contents.
• If inadvertent spillage does occur, lavage the peritoneal cavity meticulously. Remove any solid
content using an appropriate bag.
• RCOG – in case of endometrioma, obtain histology to exclude rare cases of malignancy.
Obtaining such histology using the standard surgical technique will inevitably cause peritoneal
spill of cyst contents. There is a risk of inadvertently upstaging a tumour if the suspected
endometrioma is actually a malignant tumour. As there is no effective preoperative discriminator
between an endometrioma and some rare cases of ovarian cancer, such upstaging may be
inevitable. This is rare: in one series, no cases of malignancy in 814 women were reported with
endometriomas of > 30 mm in diameter.
• Try to remove benign ovarian masses via the umbilical port. This results in less postoperative
pain and a quicker retrieval time than when using lateral ports of the same size.
• Avoidance of extending accessory ports reduces postoperative pain, incidence of incisional
hernia, and epigastric vessel injury. It also has better cosmesis.

• In presence of large masses with solid components, laparotomy may be appropriate.
Also indicated:
* If there is suspicion of malignancy.
* If the patient is unfit for laparoscopy because of obesity or extensive abdominal
scarring following previous surgery.
• Maximum cyst size above which laparotomy should be considered is controversial.
Cyst rupture is reported more often in the laparoscopy group in women with cysts
> 70 mm. It is likely that drainage or removal of large ovarian cysts will require
significant extension of the laparoscopic port incision, in which case the advantages of
laparoscopic approach would be reduced.

• Age – disease of older, post-menopausal women with over 80% of cases being diagnosed in women aged
over 50 years. There is a steep increase in incidence after the usual age of the menopause. The highest
age-specific incidence rates are seen for women aged 80–84 years (69/100,000), dropping to 64/100,000 in
women aged ≥ 85 years.
• Ethnicity – higher in whites compared with Asians and blacks.
• Family history – women with no family history have a 1.5% lifetime risk; those with one affected firstdegree relative have 5% lifetime risk; and those with two first-degree relatives have a 7% lifetime risk.
• Genetics – approximately 5–10% of cases are a result of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations. Lifetime risk with
BRCA mutations is 15–60%. Associated with multiple primary cancers or early onset cancers in a family
tree (breast/ovary/colorectal).
• Risk tends to be reduced by factors that interrupt ovulation such as pregnancy, breastfeeding and oral
contraceptive use. While prolonged exposure to ovulation such as nulliparity and infertility increase risk.
• Women who have given birth have a lower risk of ovarian cancer than women who have not.
• HRT – 5 years of use of oestrogen-only HRT increased the risk by 22%, significantly more than the 10%
risk increase with use of oestrogen–progestin HRT. The risk is increased for current users of HRT and the
risk increases with duration of use, becoming significant after 7 or more years of use. Past or short-term use
of HRT is unlikely to increase the risk of ovarian cancer.
• Smoking increases risk of ovarian cancer, doubling risk of mucinous tumours.

History
• Any of the following symptoms, which are persistent or frequent particularly
for more than 12 times/month (especially in women ≥ 50 years of age):
* Persistent abdominal distension (‘bloating’).
* Feeling full (early satiety) and/or loss of appetite.
* Pelvic or abdominal pain.
* Increased urinary urgency and/or frequency.
• Symptoms within the last 12 months that suggest IBS, as IBS rarely presents
for the first time in women of this age.
• Unexplained weight loss, fatigue, changes in bowel habit.
• PMB.

Examination
• A pelvic or abdominal mass. • Ascites.

Screening
Low-risk women

• CA125 – low sensitivity and specificity.
* Only about 85% of women with ovarian cancer have raised CA125.
* Only 50% of women with early stage ovarian cancer have raised CA125.
* Women with other conditions can also have raised CA125.
• TVS – low specificity.
• UKCTOCS – investigates ovarian cancer screening in women in the general population between the ages of
50 and 74 years, with CA125 and TVS. Early results suggest that CA125 and TVS can be used on a large
scale to successfully identify ovarian cancers. Over the next 5 years, the study will be looking at whether an
ovarian screening programme using these tests could help to reduce deaths in the UK from ovarian cancer.
High-risk women

Women with ≥ 2 relatives on the same side of the family diagnosed with ovarian cancer or breast cancer at a
young age (strong family history or inheritance of a particular faulty gene). (Cancerresearch.org.uk, nhs.uk)
• If at higher risk, women can be screened for breast cancer from 35 years old onwards or from 5 years before
the age at which the youngest relative was diagnosed.
* Screening will then carry on yearly for the rest of life.
• The UK Familial Ovarian Cancer Screening Study (UKFOCSS) study – screening women who are at a high
risk of developing ovarian cancer because of a family history of cancer of the ovary or breast, or they have
family members with a known genetic fault (such as BRCA1 or BRCA2). Results awaited.

Stage IV

Limited to ovaries

Pelvic extension

Abdominal extension and/or regional
lymph nodes

Distant metastases outside
peritoneal cavity

IA – one ovary.
IB – both ovaries.
IC – ruptured capsule, surface tumour or
­positive washings.
• ≈ up to 50% of women with early stage
cancer will develop a recurrence and 20–30%
will die from the disease.
• Women with stage I disease tend to be younger;
50% will have a normal serum CA125 level;
USS features can appear benign.
• ≈ 25% of women with apparent early stage
will have more advanced disease.

IIA – uterus, Fallopian tube(s).
IIB – other pelvic tissue.
IIC – positive washings, ascites.

IIIA – microscopic peritoneal metastases.
IIIB – macroscopic peritoneal metastases < 2 cm.
IIIC – macroscopic peritoneal metastases > 2 cm and/or
regional lymph nodes.

Stage I tumours with dense adhesions to other pelvic
structures should be ‘upstaged’ and treated as stage II
tumours, as the relapse rate appears to be similar.

• Type of surgery and postoperative chemotherapy depends upon the stage and other
clinicopathological prognostic factors.
• Favourable prognostic factors:
* Surgical stage. * Small tumour volume (before and after surgery). * Younger age.
* Good performance status. * Cell type other than mucinous or clear cell.
* Well-differentiated tumour. * Absence of ascites.
• Good prognostic factors for patients with stage I disease: * Low grade.
* Absence of dense adhesions. * Minimal ascites. * Subgroups A/B vs C.
* Cell type other than clear cell.

Management

Early stage disease, FIGO stage I and IIA

Advanced disease, FIGO stage IIB and above

• Optimal surgery – midline laparotomy, TAH, BSO, infracolic omentectomy;
biopsies of any peritoneal deposits; random biopsies of the pelvic and
abdominal peritoneum; and retroperitoneal lymph node assessment.
• Retroperitoneal lymph node assessment – sampling of retroperitoneal lymphatic
tissue from the para-aortic area and pelvic side walls if there is a palpable
abnormality, or random sampling if there is no palpable abnormality.
• Do not perform systematic retroperitoneal lymphadenectomy (SRL – block
dissection of lymph nodes from the pelvic side walls to the level of the renal
veins) as part of standard surgical treatment.

See next page.

• Younger patients with localized, unilateral tumours and
favourable histology, who wish to conserve fertility,
unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy may be sufficient.
• Wedge biopsy of the contralateral ovary – if the
contralateral ovary is not normal on inspection.

• Stage IA/B, well-differentiated, non-clear cell histology –
optimal surgery alone is adequate.
• Do not offer adjuvant chemotherapy to women who
have had optimal surgical staging and have low-risk
stage I disease (grade 1 or 2, stage IA or IB).

• Stage IA/B poorly differentiated, densely adherent, clear cell
histology and all grades, stage IC and IIA – optimal surgery,
staging, and adjuvant chemotherapy.
• Women with high-risk stage I disease (grade 3 or stage IC) –
adjuvant chemotherapy with 6 cycles of carboplatin.

Role of systematic retroperitoneal lymphadenectomy (SRL)

Role of adjuvant systemic chemotherapy

• Around 22% of women considered to have stage I ovarian cancer will have occult retroperitoneal
lymph node metastases, which can only be identified by removing affected nodes. Current surgical
staging guidelines recommend only sampling a number of pelvic and/or para-aortic nodes, whereas
SRL aims to remove all pelvic and para-aortic lymph nodes up to the renal vessels as a block
dissection on both sides.
• SRL is a major surgical procedure with potential risks of prolonged anaesthesia and surgical
complications such as increased blood loss and transfusion, ureteric injury, lymphoedema,
lymphocysts, damage to nerves and major vessels.
• No international agreement on whether the potential survival benefits of SRL outweigh the risks.
• Use of perioperative frozen section might be a way of selecting patients who need SRL.

• In women with apparent stage I disease, chemotherapy can be given in certain
circumstances, such as poorly differentiated tumours and in certain histological
subtypes (for example, clear cell carcinomas). This is done to treat residual disease that
is suspected but may not, in fact, exist. Therefore, some women without residual disease
will receive chemotherapy with its associated risks.
• Cochrane review – women receiving adjuvant therapy have a considerable advantage
in overall survival and progression-free survival. In particular, those women who
have been inadequately staged gain survival advantage from immediate adjuvant
chemotherapy.

Gynaecological oncology

Advanced disease, FIGO stage IIB–IIIC
Maximal cytoreduction + chemotherapy

• Surgery –TAH, BSO, omentectomy with staging biopsies.
Maximal cytoreduction with the objective of complete
resection of all macroscopic disease.
• If initial maximal cytoreduction is not performed, consider
interval debulking surgery (IDS) in patients responding to
chemotherapy, or showing stable disease.
• IDS should ideally be performed after 3 cycles of
chemotherapy, followed by 3 further cycles of chemotherapy.

• There is no evidence of a survival benefit for
‘second-look’ surgery following completion
of chemotherapy in patients whose disease
appears to be in complete remission.
• Value of secondary tumour reduction at the
time of second-look laparotomy is not clear.

• First-line chemotherapy (usually following surgery).
* Paclitaxel in combination with a platinum-based compound (PBC).
* Or platinum-based therapy (PBT) alone (cisplatin or carboplatin).
• Do not offer intraperitoneal chemotherapy, except as part of a clinical
trial. (NICE)
• Consider neoadjuvant chemotherapy for patients considered initially
not optimally resectable. The survival outcome may be inferior to that
from successful primary surgery followed by chemotherapy.

Advanced disease, FIGO stage IV
Maximal cytoreduction/tissue biopsy + chemotherapy

• Patients may obtain a survival advantage from having maximal surgically
cytoreduction at initial laparotomy.
• Younger patients with good performance status, pleural effusion as the only site of
disease outside the abdominal cavity, small volume metastases, and no major organ
dysfunction should be considered for surgery as for stage IIB–III disease.
• If surgery is not planned, the diagnosis should be confirmed by biopsy and
chemotherapy administered as recommended for stage IIB–IIIC disease.

• Tissue diagnosis – obtain a tissue diagnosis by histology (or cytology) in all but
exceptional cases prior to chemotherapy.
• Offer chemotherapy without a tissue diagnosis (histology or cytology), only:
* In exceptional cases, after discussion with the MDT.
* After discussion with the woman regarding the possible benefits and risks.
• If surgery has not been performed, use histology rather than cytology to obtain a tissue
diagnosis by:
* Percutaneous image-guided biopsy.
* Consider laparoscopic biopsy if percutaneous image-guided biopsy is not feasible or
has not produced an adequate sample.
• Use cytology if histology is not appropriate.

Evidence round-up
Advanced disease, FIGO stage II and above

Primary surgery

First-line chemotherapy

Primary or secondary surgery

• Surgery can be either primary (performed for the first time, either before or after
chemotherapy) or secondary (performed after primary surgery). Secondary surgery
can be sub-classified into either early, when performed during chemotherapy
(usually termed interval debulking surgery or IDS), or late when performed after
primary chemotherapy (also called second-look laparotomy).
• Primary cytoreductive surgery is the standard treatment for advanced ovarian
cancer, even in cases when all disease could not be removed. The rationale for
early cytoreductive surgery as part of primary management is to improve tumour
chemosensitivity and avoid chemoresistance.
• If performing surgery for women with ovarian cancer, whether before
chemotherapy or after neoadjuvant chemotherapy, the objective should be
complete resection of all macroscopic disease.

• Induction or neoadjuvant chemotherapy has been used to
reduce tumour burden and facilitate surgery, possibly optimizing
cytoreduction and reducing morbidity.
• This approach can be used:
* As induction chemotherapy after initial primary surgery and
before a second operation (termed interval debulking surgery).
* As neoadjuvant chemotherapy prior to primary surgery.
• IDS is usually performed after 2–4 cycles of chemotherapy so as to
prevent the development of chemoresistance.

Second-line chemotherapy

• However, there is inconclusive evidence on:
* Is primary surgery prior to chemotherapy more beneficial than after neoadjuvant chemotherapy?
* Does primary surgery in women with advanced ovarian cancer have a therapeutic value in terms
of overall survival, especially when all macroscopic disease cannot be removed?
• A Cochrane review of chemotherapy vs surgery for the initial treatment of advanced ovarian cancer
(one small RCT; n= 85 women) – no statistically significant difference in median overall survival
between treatments.

First-line chemotherapy for ovarian cancer

• Options: * A PBC alone. * Paclitaxel + PBC.
• Choice depends on side-effect profiles of the alternative therapies, the stage of the disease, the extent of
surgical treatment of the tumour, and disease-related performance status.

• Responses can occur when first-line chemotherapy is repeated for a second and sometimes a third time, although they occur
proportionately less frequently and do not last as long.
• Women who initially respond to first-line therapy are also more likely to respond to second and subsequent courses of therapy.
• Two factors predictive of second and subsequent response to first-line therapy are the length of the progression-free interval and
the extent of the relapse (that is, the number of tumour sites involved and their volume).
• Current best practice for women who initially respond to first-line therapy is to give second and possibly subsequent courses of
the same treatment at some point.
• Use of paclitaxel/PBT in the treatment of recurrent (or resistant) ovarian cancer is recommended if the patient has not received
this drug combination previously.
• If the patient has already received both drugs, the combination of paclitaxel and PBT in recurrent (or resistant) ovarian cancer is
not recommended, outside the context of clinical trials.

193

• Complete response – disease not detectable for at least
4 weeks, and a partial response is defined as tumour size
reduced by at least 50% for > 4 weeks.
• Although most patients (70–80%) initially respond to
first-line chemotherapy, most responders (55–75%)
eventually relapse within 2 years.
• Platinum-sensitive – disease that responds to first-line PBT
but relapses ≥ 12 months after completion of initial PBC.
• Partially platinum-sensitive – disease that responds to
first-line PBT but relapses between 6 and 12 months after
completion of initial PBC.
• Platinum-resistant – disease that relapses within 6 months
of completion of initial PBC.
• Platinum-refractory – disease that does not respond to
initial PBC.

Gynaecological oncology

If re-treatment with first-line therapies failed

Second-line chemotherapies

• These may alleviate symptoms, but may also prolong survival.
• Range of adverse effects.
• Choice of second-line therapy is influenced by the effectiveness of the different agents
and the patient’s response to first-line therapy regimens.
• Seven agents are licensed – paclitaxel, carboplatin, chlorambucil, treosulfan,
hexamethylmelamine (altretamine), topetecan, and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin
hydrochloride (PLDH).

• Single-agent paclitaxel – for women with platinum-refractory or platinumresistant advanced ovarian cancer.
• Paclitaxel in combination with a PBC (carboplatin or cisplatin) – women
with platinum-sensitive or partially platinum-sensitive advanced ovarian
cancer.
• PLDH – women with partially platinum-sensitive, platinum-resistant, or
platinum-refractory advanced ovarian cancer.
• Topotecan – only for those women with platinum-refractory or platinumresistant advanced ovarian cancer, or those who are allergic to PBC, for
whom PLDH and single-agent paclitaxel are considered inappropriate.

Follow-up

Response evaluation

Follow-up

• CA125 levels – correlate with tumour response and with survival. Measure
at regular intervals during chemotherapy.
• CT scan:
* Abnormal at baseline – Repeat after cycle 6, unless there is evidence
(e.g., CA125 levels not falling) of non-responding disease; in this case
an earlier CT scan would be indicated.
* Normal at baseline – no need of further CT scans, provided there is no
clinical or biochemical indication of disease progression.
* Consider an interim CT scan after three cycles of chemotherapy for a
patient who is negative for serum CA125, or for whom IDS is being
considered.
• Current data does not support maintenance/consolidation treatment
beyond six cycles.
• Patients with a partial response (or elevated CA125) after six cycles of
chemotherapy, but continuing evidence of response by CA125, can be
considered for a further three cycles of the same chemotherapy.

• History and pelvic examination every 3 months for 2 years, every 4
months during the third year, and every 6 months during years 4 and 5
or until progression is documented.
• CA125 can accurately predict tumour relapse, but it is unknown
whether the early detection by CA125 offers any advantage.
• CT scans if there is clinical or CA125 evidence of progressive disease.

Recurrent disease

• ≈ 75% of cases respond to initial therapy; however, over 55% relapse within 2 years.
• Goal of the treatment is to improve QOL.
• Patients who relapse within 6 months have a poor prognosis and poor response to
platinum-containing regimens.
• Patients with long intervals (> 6 months) from initial chemotherapy, offer platinumbased combination chemotherapy.
• Patients with long intervals (> 1 year) from primary surgery, consider surgical resection
of recurrent disease.
• For patients with short treatment-free intervals and with second and later recurrences,
consider palliative chemotherapy.

What will you do?
Role of laparoscopy in ovarian cancer

What will you do?
Young women with ovarian cancer

Laparoscopy for early ovarian cancer

Fertility-sparing surgery for early ovarian cancer

• Suspected malignant cyst:
* Obtain pelvic washings at the beginning of the procedure.
* Avoid intentional rupture or open aspiration of any cyst.
* Aspirate cysts within an endoscopic bag to facilitate removal.
• Ovarian cancer:
* Role of laparoscopic approach is unclear.
* Obvious spread of disease beyond the ovaries (FIGO stages II–IV) should prompt
conversion to a full staging laparotomy.
* One may abandon the operation after performing a biopsy and refer the woman to a
gynaecological oncology centre.
* Potential risks of laparoscopic surgery for stage I cancer include under-staging and
dissemination of the malignancy.
• Port site metastases have been reported in 1–20% of women with ovarian cancer and
in women with advanced disease; it seems unlikely that women with unruptured stage I
disease with negative washings are at significant risk.

• The chance that an ovarian cyst is malignant or borderline in a woman < 40 years of age is
around 10%.
• In women with a suspicious complex ovarian cyst or mass who wish to conserve their fertility,
it would be reasonable to offer a unilateral oophorectomy combined with surgical staging.
• Microscopic involvement of a normal-looking contralateral ovary is rare in stage I ovarian
cancer, with a reported frequency of 2.5%.
• Frozen section analysis of abnormal ovarian lesions can avoid unnecessary staging surgery in
99% of women with benign lesions but should identify 90% of women who would benefit.
• A unilateral oophorectomy combined with surgical staging is an optimal primary treatment for
borderline or germ cell tumours.
• Effect on fertility of chemotherapy drugs such as platinum agents and taxanes is not well
established. The fertility effect of alkylating agents in breast cancer is age-dependent and this
suggests that the degree of ovarian reserve is important.
• Women should be fully aware that declining adjuvant treatment can affect their prognosis but
they may wish to accept this risk to conserve their fertility. Evidence is limited on this subject.

Sex cord stromal ovarian tumours

Clinical presentation and diagnosis
• Symptoms – subacute pelvic pain, feeling of pelvic pressure due to the presence of a pelvic
mass, and menstrual irregularities.
• Sertoli–Leydig cell tumours typically produce androgens, and clinical virilization is noted in
70–85% of patients.
• Investigations – pelvic USS, abdominopelvic CT scan, chest X-ray, and PET scan for
selected cases; FBC, LFT, RFT.
• Tumour markers – hCG, AFP, LDH; inhibin is secreted by granulosa cell tumours.
• Suspected gonadoblastomas – karyotype in all pre-menarche girls because of the propensity
of these tumours to arise in dysgenetic gonads.
• The definitive diagnosis requires a surgical specimen.

• Granulosa-stromal cell tumours.
• Granulosa cell tumours:
* Adult type.
* Juvenile type.
• Tumours in the thecoma–fibroma group:
* Thecoma.
* Fibroma–fibrosarcoma.
* Sclerosing stromal tumour.
• Sertoli–Leydig cell tumours
(androblastomas):
* Sertoli cell tumours.
* Leydig cell tumour.
* Sertoli–Leydig cell tumours.
• Gynandroblastoma.
• Sex cord tumour with anular tubules.
• Unclassified.

Surgical staging as for epithelial ovarian cancer.
Only in cases of evidence of nodal abnormality is node dissection required.
Surgery by laparotomy or in selected cases by laparoscopy.
Surgical staging for endodermal sinus tumour is not indicated because all patients need chemotherapy.
SCSTs – retroperitoneal evaluation is not mandatory because of the very low incidence of retroperitoneal metastases in early stage.
Endometrial curettage must be performed to rule out concomitant uterine cancers in patients with granulosa cell tumour.
Stage is the most important prognostic factor.
SCSTs – patients with advanced disease have a significantly poorer survival rate.
GCTs – given their sensitivity to chemotherapy, even more advanced stage disease can have a good prognosis.

Management
Germ cell tumours

Sex cord stromal tumours

• Unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy with preservation of the contralateral ovary and the
uterus is possible, even in advanced stages, owing to the sensitivity of the tumour to
chemotherapy.
• No systematic ovarian biopsy need be performed where the contralateral ovary is
macroscopically normal.

• Conservative surgery in young patients at stage I.
• Post-menopausal women and in patients with advanced stage
disease or with bilateral ovarian involvement – TAH and BSO
with surgical staging.

Early stage disease, Stage I–IIA

Advanced disease, Stage IIB–IV

Early stage disease, Stage I–IIA

Advanced disease, Stage IIB–IV

• 60–70% are diagnosed at an early stage.
• Stage I has long-term disease-free status
of 90%.
• After adequate surgical staging, further
adjuvant treatment is not required.
• Stage IA immature teratoma or stage I
pure dysgerminoma can be treated with
surgery only.
• All patients with stage I endodermal sinus
are treated with adjuvant combination
chemotherapy therapy of bleomycin,
etoposide, and cisplatin (BEP).

• Debulking surgery, but without major
extensive procedures given the high
chemosensitivity.
• Platinum-based regimens are the
treatment of choice (BEP).
• Optimal duration of therapy is debatable,
but three cycles of BEP with completely
resected disease and four cycles for
patients with macroscopic residual disease
seem appropriate.
• Even though dysgerminomas are very
sensitive to radiation therapy, there is no
evidence to support the use of adjuvant
radiation therapy for advanced stage GCTs.

• 60–95% are at stage I at the time of
diagnosis.
• Stage I has long-term disease-free status is
90% of the cases.
• Any postoperative treatment is
controversial.
• Some authors suggest adjuvant therapy
for stage IC patients with high mitotic
index. In this case, platinum-based
chemotherapy is the treatment of choice.

• Debulking surgery.
• Platinum-based chemotherapy with an
overall response rate of 63–80%.
• The BEP regimen for 3–6 cycles for
adjuvant postoperative chemotherapy and
for patients with recurrent SCSTs.
• Taxanes have a favourable toxicity profile.
• Taxane and platinum combination
chemotherapy needs future trials.
• Little evidence exists for the use of
hormonal or radiation therapy.

Follow-up
Response evaluation

• Serum tumour markers (hCG, AFP, LDH, CA125, and
inhibin) can accurately correlate with tumour response
during chemotherapy.
• CT scan of the abdomen, pelvis, and chest (in case of
suspected lung metastases), and pelvic ultrasound to
evaluate the response to chemotherapy in patients with
measurable disease.

197

Follow-up

• GCT – ≈ 75% of recurrences occur within the first year after initial treatment; the most
common site is the peritoneal cavity and more rarely the retroperitoneal lymph nodes.
• SCST – has indolent nature with a tendency to late recurrence (median time to relapse is 4–6
years), requires long-term surveillance. Common sites of recurrence are the upper abdomen
(55–70%) and the pelvis (30–45%).
The follow-up visit:
• History, physical, and pelvic examination.
• Tumour markers every 3 months for the first 2 years, and every 6 months during years 3–5
or until progression is documented.
• Pelvic USS every 6 months in those patients who underwent fertility-sparing surgery,
whereas CT scan of the abdomen and pelvic is usually performed yearly.

SECTION 6

Gynaecological oncology

Breast and ovarian cancer – BRCA1 or BRCA2

Background and incidence
• ≈ 5–10% of cases of ovarian cancer are likely to be hereditary, the majority of which
will be accounted for by BRCA1 and BRCA2.
• These account for ≈ 40–50% of hereditary breast cancer-only families and 95% of
families with both breast and ovarian cancer.
• Autosomal dominant.
• Ratio of BRCA1:BRCA2 mutations in breast cancer and ovarian cancer families – The
incidence of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations in breast and ovarian cancer in families is
52 and 32%. The remaining 16% are linked to neither mutation.
• Ashkenazi Jew population: BRCA mutations occur in up to 2% of the population.

Cumulative risks for the development of breast/ovarian cancer

• Normal population – breast 10%, ovarian 1.4%, endometrial 1.1%.
• BRCA 1
– breast 65%, ovarian 39%.
• BRCA 2
– breast 45%, ovarian 11% (male breast 6% and prostate cancer).

Scoring systems
Diagnosis of BRCA family

• Individuals can be at risk of being a carrier of BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations, based
on the family history. This gives a score according to the age at onset of breast
or ovarian cancers and allows the probability of finding a mutation in BRCA1 or
BRCA2 to be calculated.
• Threshold of around 10% can be used, so that family trees with a score of 10 or
more are likely to have at least a 10% chance of finding a mutation.
• Greater the number of cases and the younger the age at onset, the more likely it is
that the cancer is related to an underlying genetic predisposition.

• There are no guidelines available. Highly suggestive if:
* Clustering of breast and ovarian cancer (particularly in ≥ 3 women); especially early onset.
* Bilateral breast and/or ovarian cancer, or breast and ovarian cancers in the same woman.
* Histology – serous ovarian cancers if accompanied by a family history.
• Male transmission of a mutation in BRCA1 or BRCA2 can occur.
• Borderline tumours and isolated early onset ovarian cancers, which are more likely to be
borderline and mucinous, are not generally associated with BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene carriers.

Management

Cancer surveillance

• No preventative measures will eliminate the risk of cancer completely.
• Screening to identify cancer at an early and potentially curable stage –
currently, there is no published evidence that ovarian cancer screening (CA125,
TVS) significantly reduces mortality.
• Although breast screening mammography is offered to women at increased
genetic risk from about 35 years of age, this may not be the ideal technique
for imaging younger women with a high likelihood of developing high-grade
tumours. Offer annual MRI for women aged 30–49 years, who are known to
be BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers. (NICE, 2006)
• Chemoprevention – COCs may be effective in high-risk gene carriers, but there
also appears to be an increased breast cancer risk associated with COCs use in
BRCA gene carriers.

Prophylactic surgery

• Prophylactic surgery can be carried out before cancer develops. There is also an increased
risk of cancer of the Fallopian tube, so these must be removed with the ovaries.
• BSO reduces the risk of ovarian cancers from up to 40% to around 1–2%, and the risk of
breast cancer can also be reduced by approximately 50%.
• Residual risk of primary peritoneal cancer is 4.3%, 20 years after BSO.
• Risks – complications of surgery, premature menopause, and psychological issues.
• Preventative mastectomy.
• Age for prophylactic surgery – risk of ovarian cancer rises steeply after 30 years of age for
BRCA1 and after 40 years of age for BRCA2.
* BRCA1 – women may opt for ovarian surgery in their 30s, when the risk of breast
cancer is still high, to achieve maximum risk reduction for both breast and ovarian
cancer, while preserving breast tissue.
* BRCA2 – women may wait until the early 40s for both types of surgery.

Hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer syndrome (HNPCC)

Background and incidence
• Autosomal dominant.
• Mutations in mismatch repair genes MLH1, MSH2, and MSH6.
• Mutation carriers susceptible to colorectal cancer, endometrial and ovarian
cancer, other gastrointestinal tract cancers, urothelial, and brain cancers.
• Smaller percentage of endometrial cancer is likely to be hereditary, with
estimates of at least 1.8% of endometrial cancer attributed to HNPCC.

• Cumulative risks for the development of ovarian/endometrial cancer:
* MLH1 – ovarian 3.4%, endometrial 27%.
* MSH2 – ovarian 10.4%, endometrial 40%.
* MSH6 – endometrial 71%.
• MSH2 has a higher risk than MLH1 mutation carriers and MLH1/
MSH2 have a higher risk in comparison with MSH6.

Diagnosis of HNPCC family
• Diagnosis of HNPCC family is clinical.
• The Amsterdam criteria (1999) for HNPCC-associated cancers are frequently used to select
families for molecular testing. Based on an early age of cancer onset, multiple cancers, and
clustering of HNPCC-associated cancers in the family history –
* There are at least three relatives with an HNPCC-associated cancer (large bowel,
endometrium, small bowel, ureter, or renal pelvis; not including stomach, ovary, brain,
bladder, or skin). * One affected person is a first-degree relative of the other two.
* At least two successive generations are affected.
* At least one person was diagnosed before the age of 50 years.
* Familial adenomatous polyposis has been excluded.
* Tumours have been verified by pathological examination.

• Prevalence of mismatch repair gene mutations in HNPCC families – 45%
of the families meeting the Amsterdam criteria will have a mutation in
MLH1/MSH2.
• MSH6 has a slightly different phenotype in comparison with these
two genes, with a later onset of colorectal cancer and a propensity for
endometrial cancer in females. The frequency of MSH6 mutations has
been estimated to be approximately 10% of all mismatch repair mutations
in HNPCC families.
• Up to 50% of HNPCC families do not have an identifiable mutation in
any of the known mismatch repair genes.

Management
• Cancer surveillance – 2-yearly colonoscopy may reduce the incidence and mortality from colorectal cancer.
• No such evidence exists for endometrial and ovarian cancer screening.
• Prophylactic hysterectomy/oophorectomy is an option for carrier women, especially for those with a
mutation in MSH6, but long-term follow-up is insufficient and further data are needed.
• Trials of ovarian cancer surveillance and IUCDs containing progestogens are ongoing.

SECTION 7

Sexual and reproductive health

CHAPTER 38 Chronic pelvic pain (CPP)

Differential diagnosis

Background and definition
• Definition – intermittent or constant pain in the lower abdomen or pelvis of at least 6 months’ duration, not
occurring exclusively with menstruation or intercourse and not associated with pregnancy.
• It may be associated with incomplete relief with most treatments; significantly impaired function at home or
work; signs of depression, such as early awakening, weight loss, or anorexia; and may significantly impact on a
woman’s quality of life (QOL).
• Incidence – affects 1/6 of the adult female population.
• Issues – psychological and social issues such as depression and sleep disorders.
• Aetiology is unclear. CPP should be seen as a symptom with a number of contributory factors rather than as a
diagnosis in itself.

History
• Pattern of the pain and its association with the menstrual cycle, aggravating and alleviating factors, and the
effect of movement and posture on pain.
• Clinical measurement of pain level at each visit; e.g., ‘on a scale of 0 to 10’.
• Bladder and bowel symptoms.
• Results of previous attempts at treatment and the amount of medication used.
• Daily pain diary for 2–3 menstrual cycles may be helpful in tracking symptoms or activities associated with the
pain.
• Impact of pain on the patient’s QOL; effect of pain on daily activities, work, relationships, sleep, or sexual
functioning.
• Psychological assessment: symptoms such as sleep or appetite disturbance and tearfulness, current stress in life,
etc.
• Main concern about the pain; understanding of pain and treatment expectations.
• Abuse history – past or present sexual assault, particularly intimate partner violence. Although abuse is rarely
a cause of pelvic pain, a history of abuse often makes it more difficult for a woman to deal with pelvic pain.

Gynaecological – usually cyclical pain.

• Endometriosis, adenomyosis, fibroids. Pelvic venous congestion, chronic PID.
• Adhesions – dense vascular adhesions are likely to be a cause of CPP,
as dividing them appears to relieve pain. However, adhesions may be
asymptomatic. Adhesions may be caused by endometriosis, previous surgery,
or previous infection.
• Two distinct forms of adhesive disease are recognized:
* Residual ovary syndrome – a small amount of ovarian tissue inadvertently
left behind following oophorectomy, which may become buried in
adhesions.
* Trapped ovary syndrome – a retained ovary becomes buried in dense
adhesions following hysterectomy. Removal of all ovarian tissue or
suppression using a GnRHa may relieve pain.
Non-gynaecological:

•
•
•
•

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), constipations, inflammatory bowel disease.
Interstitial cystitis, chronic UTI, urethral syndrome.
Musculoskeletal pain, low back pain, disc disease.
Nerve entrapment in scar tissue, fascia, or a narrow foramen – pain and
dysfunction in the distribution of that nerve. The incidence of nerve
entrapment defined as highly localized, sharp, stabbing, or aching pain,
exacerbated by particular movements and persisting beyond 5 weeks, or
occurring after a pain-free interval.
• Psychological.
• Sexual or physical abuse – child sexual abuse may initiate a cascade of events
or reactions, which make an individual more vulnerable to the development
of CPP as an adult. Women who continue to be abused are particularly at risk.

Service provision

Examination
Goal – to look for pathological conditions and to reproduce patient’s usual pain to help identify physical

c­ ontributors. Identifying a focal area of tenderness can help target specific therapy.
• General – demeanour, mobility, and posture, such as abnormal gait, guarding, and careful positioning.
• Back – for scoliosis, sacroiliac tenderness, trigger points, and pelvic asymmetry.
• Abdomen – for trigger points, head-raise test.
• Vulva – a cotton swab to perform a sensory examination and to identify areas of tenderness.
• Speculum examination – cervical lesions, infections, and endometriosis implants can be identified.
• Post-hysterectomy dyspareunia may arise from localized lesions or nerve entrapment at the vaginal vault:
palpating the vault with a long cotton swab may assist in identifying focal source.
• Pelvic examination:
* Tone and muscle control. * Whether vaginismus is present. * Cervical motion tenderness.
* Uterine mobility. * Uterine or adnexal tenderness and masses.
• Assess for any rectovaginal nodules, scarring, or tethering – a rectovaginal examination to determine its extent.

• Discuss women’s concerns and issues. When the patient feels that her
experience of the pain is believed and that the clinician will do his/her best to
help, there is better compliance with the proposed treatment plans. There is
higher acceptance by the patient of more realistic goals of treatment, such as
improved function and QOL, as opposed to complete resolution of pain.
• Discuss the multifactorial nature of CPP. The aim is to develop a partnership
between the clinician and the woman to plan a management programme.
• CPP clinics with multidisciplinary approach – the integrated approach
looking for organic, psychological, dietary, and environmental causes of the
pain has been reported to be associated with significantly greater pain relief
than the standard treatment.

http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/CBO9781316156513.039

Initial management at primary care
Many women with CPP can be managed in primary care by GPs.

‘Red flag’ symptoms and signs

•
•
•
•
•

Investigations

Bleeding per rectum. • PCB. • Excessive weight loss.
New bowel symptoms in patients > 50 years of age.
New pain after the menopause.
Pelvic mass. • Suicidal ideation.
Irregular vaginal bleeding in women > 40 years of age.

• Screen for chlamydia and gonorrhoea, if there is any suspicion of PID.
• Offer screening for STIs for all sexually active women.

Cyclical pain

General

• Therapeutic trial of ovarian suppression (COCs, progestogens, danazol, or GnRHa) for a
period of 3–6 months. It can be an effective treatment for pain associated with endometriosis,
and the response to ovarian suppression can therefore be a useful diagnostic tool.
• Where pain is strikingly cyclical and no abnormality is palpable at vaginal examination, a
therapeutic trial of a GnRH agonist may be more helpful than a diagnostic laparoscopy.
• The LNG-IUS could be considered.
• Pelvic venous congestion also appears to be well controlled by ovarian suppression.

• Analgesics – regular NSAIDs with or without paracetamol or co-dydramol
may be useful.
• Do not prescribe opioids for regular use.
• Amitriptyline or gabapentin may be useful for the treatment of neuropathic pain.
• Non-pharmacological modalities – TENS, acupuncture, acupressure, vitamin B1,
magnesium supplementation, and other complementary therapies may be helpful.

• When pain has not been explained to the woman’s satisfaction or when pain is inadequately controlled.
• If the history suggests that there is a specific non-gynaecological component to the pain, refer to the relevant HCP – such as gastroenterologist,
urologist, genitourinary medicine physician, physiotherapist, psychologist, or psychosexual counsellor.

Investigations at secondary level

Referral

Imaging

Diagnostic laparoscopy

• TVS to screen and assess adnexal masses such as endometriomas, hydrosalpinges, or
fibroids. Endometriomas can be accurately distinguished from other adnexal masses by
TVS. It is of little value for the assessment of other causes of CPP, including peritoneal
endometriosis. However, presence of soft markers such as tenderness or poor ovarian
mobility can improve the pre-laparoscopy probability of identifying relevant pathology
at laparoscopy from 58 to 73%. In the absence of soft markers, the pre-laparoscopy
likelihood of pathology is 20%. TVS may therefore have a role in identifying those
women who are less likely to obtain a positive diagnosis from a diagnostic laparoscopy.
• TVS and MRI are useful to diagnose adenomyosis. The sensitivity of MRI and TVS
is comparable. Diagnostic accuracy of TVS for adenomyosis – sensitivity of 83% and
specificity of 85%.
• Role of MRI in diagnosing small deposits of endometriosis is uncertain. It is useful in
the assessment of palpable nodules in the pelvis or when symptoms suggest the presence
of rectovaginal disease.

• Diagnostic laparoscopy was regarded as the ‘gold standard’ in the diagnosis of CPP. It may be better
seen as a second-line investigation if other therapeutic interventions fail. It is the only test capable of
diagnosing peritoneal endometriosis and adhesions. Conditions such as IBS and adenomyosis are not
visible at laparoscopy. A third to a half of diagnostic laparoscopies will be negative. The consequences
of a negative laparoscopy have not been well studied. Much of the pathology identified is not
necessarily the cause of pain.
• Ofter when the suspicion of adhesive disease or endometriosis requiring surgical intervention is high,
or concerns such as the presence of endometriosis or adhesions potentially affecting fertility.
• Diagnostic laparoscopy may have a role in developing a woman’s beliefs about her pain. A change in
health beliefs as a result of having a laparoscopy both with positive or negative findings could help in
improving pain scores.
• Micro-laparoscopy or ‘conscious pain mapping’ – The technique seems to provide an opportunity
to confirm particular lesions as the source of the woman’s pain; however, questions remain as to the
acceptability, reproducibility, and validity of this technique.

SECTION 7

Sexual and reproductive health

Management

Treat any positive diagnosis on laparoscopy

• Adhesions, ovarian remnant syndrome (ORS), pelvic congestion syndrome, residual ovary syndrome (ROS),
post-hysterectomy CPP.
• Ovarian cysts (see Chapter 36) – chronic ovarian cysts do not usually produce pain.
• PID (see Chapter 39). * One of the long-term sequelae of PID is CPP. CPP has been reported to occur in
18–33% of women after an episode of PID. * Women with CPP are more likely to report a history of PID
and a greater number of previous PID episodes.
• Endometriosis (see Chapter 12), adenomyosis (see Chapter 11), fibroids (see Chapter 10).
Interstitial cystitis (IC); irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)

If negative laparoscopy

•
•
•
•

Presacral neurectomy – limited efficacy. (ACOG)
Laparoscopic uterosacral nerve ablation (LUNA) – ineffective. (RCOG)
Sacral nerve stimulation may decrease pain in up to 60% of women. (ACOG)
Injection of the trigger points of abdominal wall, vagina and sacrum with local
anesthetic may provide temporary or prolonged relief. (ACOG)
• Antidepressants may be helpful. (ACOG)
• Even if no explanation for the pain can be found initially, treat the pain empirically
and develop a management plan with the woman. If pain is not adequately
controlled, refer to a pain management team or a specialist pelvic pain clinic.

Pelvic congestion syndrome

• Dilated pelvic veins have been observed in some women with CPP. Symptoms may include a dull aching pain
as well as menstrual disorders. Vulval varicosities may be associated.
• Investigations – pelvic venography, Doppler USS, and MRI. In asymptomatic women undergoing MRI 38%
incidence of pelvic congestion syndrome has been reported.
• Do not offer hysterectomy as a management option for pelvic congestion syndrome.
• Ovarian vein ligations and percutaneous embolizations have been reported, but no controlled clinical trials
have evaluated the safety and long-term effectiveness of these approaches.
• Consider progestogens daily in high doses. (ACOG)

Ovarian remnant syndrome (ORS)

• ORS arises from unintentional, incomplete dissection and removal of the ovary during a difficult or
emergency oophorectomy or implantation and growth of displaced ovarian tissue in the abdomen or pelvic
cavity during oophorectomy. Often seen in patients with severe endometriosis and pelvic adhesions.
• Incidence – 18% of women presenting with CPP. After removal of the ovarian remnants, 80% of women
may report complete resolution of the CPP.
• Symptoms may present as CPP (sometimes cyclical), or as a pelvic mass with the absence of vasomotor
symptoms.
• On vaginal examination, a tender lateral pelvic cyst may be palpable.
• Pre-menopausal levels of FSH and oestradiol; USS may show pelvic cystic structure.
• Treatment – GnRHa with add-back therapy; surgical excision of the ovarian remnant with a retroperitoneal;
approach with wide local excision and lysis of adhesions.
Residual ovary syndrome

• Characterized by either recurrent pelvic pain or a persistent pelvic mass after hysterectomy. Incidence is
2.8% after hysterectomies with preservation of one or both ovaries.
• Indications for removal of the residual ovaries included CPP in 2.0%, persistent asymptomatic pelvic mass in
0.7%, and acute pelvic pain in 0.1% of patients. Ovarian malignancy is seen in 3.5/1000 cases.

• Hysterectomy is an effective treatment for CPP associated with reproductive
symptoms and results in pain relief in 75–95% of women. (ACOG). CPP has been
the principal indication for 10–12% of hysterectomies in the United States and
Canada.
• Post-hysterectomy CPP – 22% of women with hysterectomy for CPP of unknown
aetiology report persistent CPP and 5% report unchanged or increased pain. The
probability of persistent pain is higher among women <30 years old, those with
no identified pelvic disease, those who are economically disadvantaged, those with
> 2 pregnancies, and those with a history of PID. For each of these subgroups,
30–40% continue to have CPP.
• Laparoscopic evaluation of women with CPP after hysterectomy and BSO
may reveal adhesions, adnexal remnants, abnormal appendix, and abnormal
peritoneum. Main biopsy findings are endometriosis and chronic inflammation.

Adhesions

• Caused mainly by surgery, endometriosis, and abdominal or pelvic infection.
• Adhesions are found in 25–50% of women with CPP, but their role as a cause of
CPP remains controversial. A correlation between CPP and adhesions remains
uncertain.
• Retrospective series reported 69–82% reduction of CPP after adhesiolysis.
• Adhesiolysis by laparotomy has no more benefit than the wait-and-see approach.
Only the women with severe multiple vascularized adhesions involving the serosa
of the small bowel or, to a lesser extent, the colon may benefit from adhesiolysis.
• Laparoscopic adhesiolysis vs diagnostic laparoscopy – similar number (27%) of
patients in each group report resolution or substantial reduction of pain. There
is higher risk of complications in operative laparoscopy compared to diagnostic
laparoscopy (10% vs 0%).
• Adhesiolysis has not been shown to be effective in achieving pain control in RCTs.
Current evidence does not support routine adhesiolysis for CPP.

http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/CBO9781316156513.039

Interstitial cystitis

Prevalence and incidence
• IC is a poorly understood chronic inflammatory condition of the bladder.
• Its causes are unknown, its pathophysiology remains uncertain, and the efficacy of treatment is
questionable.
• Prevalence of IC in the United States is 10–67/100,000.
• Possible causes – infection, lymphatic or vascular obstruction, immunological deficiencies,
glycosaminoglycan layer deficiency, presence of a toxic urogenous substance, neural factors, and
primary mast cell disorder.

Clinical features
•
•
•
•
•
•

Pelvic pain and irritative voiding symptoms, such as frequency, urgency, and nocturia.
Frequency 8–15 times/day (average volume of 70–90 ml); once or twice per night.
Pain can radiate to suprapubic area, perineum, vulva, vagina, low back, medial thighs.
Pain can increase during or after sexual intercourse.
Symptoms can fluctuate during the menstrual cycle, with a premenstrual flare in some cases.
Examination may reveal pelvic, uterine, and bladder tenderness.

Investigations
• Diagnostic criteria and tests for IC are controversial. Symptom-based clinical diagnosis is
recommended.
• Urinalysis and urine culture to rule out microscopic haematuria and infections.
• Cystoscopy – glomerulation, submucosal haemorrhage, and terminal haematuria may be found.
Cystoscopic findings may help with prognosis, because patients with ulcers and significantly
reduced bladder capacity do not respond favourably to treatment.
• Presence of IC does not necessarily correlate with the laparoscopic findings. It is, therefore, not
possible to suggest that cystoscopy is necessary only if the results of laparoscopy are negative, or
to suggest that cystoscopy is unnecessary if endometriosis or other pelvic disorders are found.
• The intra-vesical potassium chloride (KCl) sensitivity test is a minimally invasive diagnostic test. It
may identify a subgroup of IC patients with epithelial permeability dysfunction and may predict
the response to pentosan polysulphate sodium (Elmiron). False-positive results can occur with
detrusor instability, radiation damage, and bacterial cystitis.

203

Management
• MDT – gynaecologists, urologists, and GPs.
• Pentosan polysulphate sodium – works by repairing the altered permeability of
the bladder surface. Only 28–32% of patients will have improvement with this
therapy.
• GnRHa or COCs – for patients with IC with pre-menstrual flare of symptoms.
Symptoms are reduced during therapy but relapse is common.
• Hydro-distention at the time of cystoscopy is therapeutic in 20–30% of
patients, who experience relief for 3–6 months.
• Consider IC in the differential diagnostic of CPP, especially in women
presenting with bladder or pelvic pain or dyspareunia, even if the symptoms
increase in the pre-menstrual period.
• IC is a common cause of CPP and often coexists with endometriosis.

SECTION 7

Sexual and reproductive health

Irritable bowel syndrome
Diagnosis – the Rome II criteria
Prevalence and incidence
• IBS affects up to 15% of adults, twice as common in women than men.
• Multifactorial pathophysiology – altered bowel motility, visceral hypersensitivity, and
psychosocial factors.
• Symptoms suggesting IBS exist in 50–80% of patients presenting with CPP.
• In women referred to a gynaecology clinic, the prevalence of IBS – 37%.
• IBS can coexist with other pelvic diseases or be the sole cause of CPP in women.

• In the preceding year, the patient should have had > 12 weeks of abdominal
discomfort or pain and at least two of the following:
* Pain or discomfort that is relieved after defecation.
* Association of the onset of pain or discomfort with a change in stool frequency, or
stool appearance.
• In the presence of bloating or a feeling of abdominal distension, organic disease must
be excluded.

History

Investigations

• Abdominal pain and discomfort, bloating, and disturbed bowel habits (diarrhoea,
constipation, or both). * Abnormal stool frequency (< 3 bowel movements per week or
> 3 per day). * Abnormal stool form. * Abnormal stool passage (straining, urgency, feeling of
incomplete evacuation). * Passage of mucus.
• It can be associated with dyspareunia, and bowel symptoms worsen during menstruation in
50% of women.
• Symptom-based diagnostic criteria – diagnosis of IBS with a PPV of 98%.

• Initial investigations – FBC, TFT, and LFT.
• For patients < 40 years of age and a negative history, evaluation should include
sigmoidoscopy.
• For patients > 45 years of age or with rectal bleeding, weight loss, anaemia, or a
family history of colorectal cancer, colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy with a barium
enema should be performed.

Management of IBS
• Offer a trial of antispasmodics – smooth-muscle relaxants such as mebeverine.
• Efficacy of bulking agents has not been established but they are commonly used.
• Amending the diet to control symptoms – using an exclusion diet. 36% are able to identify one or more dietary components, the
avoidance of which can lead to sustained improvement in symptoms. The most commonly implicated foods are dairy products and grains.

Lifestyle

• Dietary manipulation may be of benefit. Elimination of dietary lactose,
sorbitol, and fructose may be of value. About 40% of patients with IBS
have lactose intolerance.
• Caffeinated products, carbonated products, and gas-producing foods may
contribute to bloating.
• Smoking and gum chewing lead to more swallowing of air and may
increase gas or bloating.
• Excessive alcohol consumption may lead to increased rectal urgency.

Medical management

•
•
•
•
•

Pain – antispasmodic agents or tricyclic compounds may be helpful.
Constipation – increase dietary fibre along with osmotic laxatives. Discourage long-term use of stimulant laxatives.
Diarrhoea – increase dietary fibre and antidiarrhoeal agents such as loperamide.
Serotonin receptor agonists stimulate colonic motility and may diminish visceral hypersensitivity.
Peppermint oil decreases abdominal distension, reduces stool frequency, decreases borborygmi, and reduces
flatulence.
• GnRH analogues can result in a significant reduction in abdominal pain and nausea in pre-menopausal women
with functional bowel disease.
• Combining psychological treatment with medical therapy improves the clinical response more than that with
medical therapy only.

What not to do
•
•
•
•
•

Evidence round-up – systematic review

Routine adhesiolysis for CPP.
MRI in diagnosing small deposits of endometriosis
Diagnostic laparoscopy as first-line option for the diagnosis of CPP.
Presacral neurectomy for treatment of CPP.
Laparoscopic uterosacral nerve ablation (LUNA) for management of CPP.

• Laparoscopic adhesiolysis or laparoscopic uterosacral nerve ablation do not improve pain scores more
than diagnostic laparoscopy. The evidence to conclude that surgical intervention is either effective or
ineffective or that one technique is superior to another is insufficient.
• RCTs comparing LUNA with no additional intervention – there is no significant difference between
LUNA and No LUNA for the pain recorded over a 12-month period. LUNA does not result in
improved CPP.
• Psychological therapies for chronic pelvic pain – the current evidence does not conclude whether
psychological interventions have an effect on self-reported pain scores in women with CPP.

Consent – diagnostic laparoscopy

Discuss

• Explain the procedure: insertion of a laparoscope through a
small incision to identify the problem.
• Intended benefits: to find the cause of symptoms. Occasionally,
a minor laparoscopic procedure is appropriate to treat some of
the identified causes or relieve the symptoms.
• Laparoscopy may not identify an obvious cause for the
presenting complaint.
• Benefits and risks of any available alternative
• Treatments, including no treatment. Discuss the role of prior
diagnostic imaging together with the option of no investigation.
• Form of anaesthesia.

• Serious risks: 2/1000.
• Damage to bowel, bladder, uterus, or major blood vessels:
2.4/1000, which would require immediate repair by laparoscopy
or laparotomy. However, up to 15% of bowel injuries might not be
diagnosed at the time of laparoscopy.
• Failure to gain entry to abdominal cavity and to complete intended
procedure.
• Hernia at site of entry.
• Death: 3–8/100,000 undergoing laparoscopy die as a result of
complications.
• Frequent risks: wound bruising, shoulder-tip pain, wound gaping,
wound infection.
• Women who are obese, who have significant pathology, who have
had previous surgery, or who have pre-existing medical conditions –
quoted risks for serious or frequent complications will be increased.
The risk of serious complications at laparoscopy also increases if an
additional therapeutic procedure is performed.

Extra procedures

• Any extra procedures which may become
necessary:
* Laparotomy.
* Repair of damage to bowel, bladder, uterus,
or blood vessels.
* Blood transfusion.

Sexual and reproductive health

CHAPTER 39 Acute pelvic inflammatory disease

Prevalence

Background and definition
• Ascending infection from the endocervix causing endometritis, salpingitis, parametritis,
oophoritis, tubo-ovarian abscess, and/or pelvic peritonitis.
• Causative agents – STIs such as Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae,
Mycoplasma genitalium, anaerobes, and other organisms.
• PID develops in 10–45% of women with endocervical gonorrhoeae and in 10–30% of
women with endocervical Chlamydia infection.

• Incidence of PID is unknown because of the difficulty in making a clinical diagnosis, because it
is often asymptomatic and can present atypically. Up to two thirds of cases remain unrecognized.
• PID is reported in 1.7% of GP attendances in women of 16–46 years of age.
• 10–15% of women of reproductive age have had one episode of PID.

Risk factors for PID
History
•
•
•
•

Bilateral lower abdominal pain or pelvic pain.
Deep dyspareunia particularly of recent onset.
Abnormal vaginal or cervical discharge.
Abnormal vaginal bleeding (IMB or PCB), which may be secondary to cervicitis and
endometritis.
• Right upper quadrant pain owing to peri-hepatitis.
• Current and recent medication.

•
•
•
•
•

Young age (< 25 years old). • Early age of first coitus.
Multiple sexual partners.
Recent new partner (within the previous 3 months).
History of STI in the woman or her partner.
Recent instrumentation of the uterus.

Risks or complications
Examination
•
•
•
•

Fever (> 38°C) – only one third of women with acute PID have a temperature of > 38°C.
Abdominal examination – bilateral lower abdominal tenderness.
Speculum examination – abnormal vaginal or cervical discharge.
Vaginal examination – cervical motion tenderness, adnexal tenderness (with or without a
palpable mass), and/or uterine tenderness.

Clinical symptoms and signs lack sensitivity and specificity. The PPV of a clinical ­diagnosis is 65–90% compared to laparoscopic diagnosis.
Keep a low threshold for empirical treatment because of the lack of definitive clinical diagnostic criteria and
because the potential consequences of not treating PID are significant.

• Sequelae – delay of only a few days in receiving appropriate treatment markedly increases the
risk of sequelae such as infertility, ectopic pregnancy, and chronic pelvic pain (CPP).
• Risk of infertility is related to the number of episodes of PID and their severity: 0.6% of women
develop infertility after an episode of mild PID, and 21% of women after two episodes of PID.
• CPP or abdominal pain develops in 18% of women who had PID.
• About a third of women have repeated infections.
• Fitz–Hugh–Curtis syndrome: right upper quadrant pain associated with peri-hepatitis occurs in
up to 10–20% of women with PID.

Differential diagnosis – lower abdominal pain in a young woman
• Ectopic pregnancy; miscarriage. Exclude pregnancy in all women suspected of having PID.
• Acute appendicitis – nausea and vomiting occurs in most patients with appendicitis but only
50% of those with PID. Cervical excitation may be present in about a quarter of women with
appendicitis.
• Endometriosis.
• IBS (other gastrointestinal disorders). • UTI.
• Ovarian cyst complications such as rupture or torsion.
• Functional pain (pain of unknown physical origin).

http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/CBO9781316156513.040

Microbiological investigations
Investigations
• Urine pregnancy test to exclude ectopic pregnancy. When the risk of ectopic pregnancy is high, repeat it 21
days after the date of last UPSI.
• Urine analysis and culture to rule out UTI.
• Excess leucocytes on a wet-mount vaginal smear are associated with PID, but are also found in women with
isolated lower genital tract infection. The absence of endocervical or vaginal pus cells on a wet-mount has a
good NPV (95%) but their presence is nonspecific (poor PPV, 17%).
• Peripheral blood leucocytosis, elevated ESR, or CRP support the diagnosis and can provide a useful
measure of disease severity but are nonspecific.
• TVS with power Doppler can identify inflamed and dilated Fallopian tubes, tubo-ovarian masses, ovarian
cyst, and cyst accidents. It may differentiate PID from acute appendicitis in a minority of cases.
• CT and MRI can assist in making a diagnosis but the evidence is limited.
• Laparoscopy enables specimens to be taken from the Fallopian tubes and the pouch of Douglas and can
provide information on the severity of the condition. It lacks sensitivity; 15–30% of suspected cases may
have no laparoscopic evidence of acute infection despite organisms being identified from the Fallopian
tubes. Do not perform routinely due to the cost, the potential difficulty in identifying mild intra-tubal
inflammation or endometritis, and high rates of intra- and inter-observer variation in diagnosing PID.
• Endometrial biopsy: presence of histological endometritis is not associated with higher rates of infertility,
CPP, or recurrent PID.

• High vaginal swab for bacterial vaginosis and candidiasis.
• Test for gonorrhoea and chlamydia. A positive result gives support to the
clinical diagnosis of PID; however, the absence of confirmed infection in the
lower genital tract site does not exclude PID.
• Gonorrhoea – endocervical specimen culture, or by NAAT. If gonorrhoea is
detected using a NAAT, take an additional endocervical swab for culture to
report antibiotic sensitivities.
• Chlamydia – endocervical specimen, preferably using a NAAT.
• Urethral sample can increase the diagnostic yield for gonorrhoea and chlamydia
but undertake it only if the more sensitive NAAT is not available.
• A first-catch urine sample or self-taken vulvovaginal swab sample provides an
alternative sample for some NAATs.
• Other organisms including M. genitalium have been associated with PID, but
do not screen routinely because of limited information on prevalence, natural
history, treatment, and cost effectiveness.

Management

Medical management
Currently limited evidence for the efficacy of antibiotic therapy in preventing the long-term complications of PID.

Outpatient setting

• Provide appropriate analgesia.
• Commence antibiotic treatment as soon as the diagnosis is suspected. Broadspectrum antibiotics to cover N. gonorrhoeae, C. trachomatis, and anaerobic
infection.
• Review at 72 hours, particularly for those with a moderate or severe
presentation.
• Advise to avoid UPSI until the patient and her partner(s) have completed
treatment and follow-up.

207

• Recommended regimens:
* IM ceftriaxone 250 mg stat or IM cefoxitin 2 g stat with oral probenecid 1 g followed by oral
doxycycline 100 mg BD plus metronidazole 400 mg BD for 14 days.
* Oral ofloxacin 400 mg BD plus oral metronidazole 400 mg BD for 14 days.
• In both regimens, metronidazole is included to improve coverage for anaerobic bacteria. Anaerobes are
of relatively greater importance in patients with severe PID, and metronidazole may be discontinued in
those patients with mild or moderate PID who are unable to tolerate it, as its addition provides uncertain
additional efficacy.
* Oral cefixime as a single dose (off-label use) can be used as an alternative to ceftriaxone.
• Avoid ofloxacin in patients who are at high risk of gonococcal PID because of increasing quinolone
resistance in the UK.
• Alternative regime (evidence is less strong) – IM ceftriaxone followed by azithromycin 1 g/week for
2 weeks.

SECTION 7

Admission to hospital

• Indications:
* Suspected ectopic pregnamcy or appendicitis.
* Clinically severe disease with fever > 38˚C.
* Tubo-ovarian abscess.
* Signs of pelvic peritonitis.
* PID in pregnancy.
* Lack of response or intolerance to oral therapy with outpatient setting.
• IV antibiotics until 24 hours after clinical improvement, followed by oral antibiotics.
• Choice of appropriate regimen is influenced by local antimicrobial sensitivity patterns,
the local epidemiology of specific infections, cost, woman’s preference and compliance,
and severity of disease.
• No evidence of the superiority of any one of the suggested regimens over the others.

Sexual and reproductive health

• Regimens:
* IV cefoxitin 2 g TDS plus IV/oral doxycycline 100 mg BD followed by oral doxycycline
100 mg BD plus oral metronidazole 400 mg BD for a total of 14 days.
* IV clindamycin 900 mg TDS plus IV gentamicin (2 mg/kg loading dose followed by 1.5 mg/kg
TID [a single daily dose of 7 mg/kg may be substituted]) followed by either oral clindamycin
450 mg QID for 14 days, or oral doxycycline 100 mg BD plus oral metronidazole 400 mg
BD for 14 days.
• Gentamicin levels need to be monitored if this regimen is used.
Alternative regimens

* IV ofloxacin 400 mg BD plus IV metronidazole 500 mg TID for 14 days.
* IV ciprofloxacin 200 mg BD plus IV/oral doxycycline 100 mg BD plus IV metronidazole
500 mg TID for 14 days.

Provide information to woman

• Detailed explanation of the condition and long-term implications for her health and the health
of her partner(s).
• Explanation of treatment and its possible adverse effects.
• That following treatment, fertility is usually maintained but there is a risk of future infertility,
CPP, or ectopic pregnancy.
• Repeat episodes of PID are associated with an exponential increase in the risk of infertility.
• Discuss contraceptive options. Use of barrier contraception significantly reduces risk of PID.
• Need to screen sexual contacts to prevent her becoming re-infected.
• Clinically, more severe disease is associated with a greater risk of sequelae.
• The earlier treatment is given, the lower the risk of future fertility problems.

Surgical management
• In severe cases or where there is clear evidence of a pelvic abscess – drain the abscess.
• Laparoscopic division of adhesions and drainage of pelvic abscesses may help early
resolution of the disease.
• USS-guided drainage of pelvic fluid collections is less invasive and may be equally
effective.
• Adhesiolysis in cases of peri-hepatitis – no evidence that this is superior to antibiotic
therapy.

Follow-up

4–6 weeks follow-up

Contraception options

• To assess:
* Adequate clinical response.
* Compliance with oral antibiotics.
* Screen and treat sexual contacts.
• Test of cure:
* Repeat testing for gonorrhoea after treatment in cases initially found to be infected,
unless sensitivity testing of the isolate confirms sensitivity to the prescribed
antibiotic.
* Repeat testing for chlamydia and gonorrhoea in cases with persisting symptoms,
poor compliance with antibiotics, and/or tracing of sexual contacts indicate the
possibility of persisting or recurrent infection.

• Can use – COCs, POP, depot progestogen injection, progesterone implant.
• COCs: Screen women on hormonal contraception presenting with breakthrough bleeding for
genital tract infection, especially C. trachomatis.
* Use of the COCs was regarded as protective against symptomatic PID. Recent studies, however,
have shown an association with an increased incidence of asymptomatic cervical infection with
C. trachomatis, with possible suggestion that the COCs may mask endometritis.
• IUD and IUS: For women with a history of PID, the relative risk of PID is increased 6-fold in the
20 days following insertion, but the absolute risk remains low (≈ 1%). After this time, the risk is
the same as for the population without an IUD and remains low unless there is exposure to STI.
* There are significantly fewer removals for PID with LNG-IUS as compared to Cu IUD. If a
woman is likely to be at risk of future PID and requests an IUD for contraception, the LNGIUS would be the most appropriate choice.

Treatment of PID in specific circumstances

Pregnant women

Management of sexual partner(s)

Woman with IUCD

• PID is rare in women with an IUP except in the case of
septic abortion. In septic abortion, the infective organism is
unlikely to be a sexually transmitted pathogen.
• In pregnancy, PID is associated with an increase in both
maternal and fetal morbidity, therefore treat with parenteral
therapy, although none of the regimens is of proven safety
in this situation. (BASHH)
• The risk of giving any of the recommended antibiotic
regimens in very early pregnancy is low, as significant drug
toxicity results in failed implantation.
• Treatment regimens depend upon organisms isolated.
• Avoid drugs known to be toxic in pregnancy,
e.g., tetracyclines.
• A combination of cefotaxime, azithromycin, and
metronidazole may be used.
• Risks associated with metronidazole are uncertain but no
confirmed associations have been reported.

• Proven or suspected STI – refer index woman and her
current sexual partner(s) to a GUM clinic for screening
other STIs, treatment, and contact tracing.
• Contact tracing – trace sexual partners within a six-month
period of the onset of symptoms.
• Advise to avoid intercourse until woman and her partner(s)
have completed the treatment course.
• Empirically treat for chlamydia in all sexual partners,
owing to the variable sensitivity of currently available
diagnostic tests.
• Gonorrhoea diagnosed in the sexual partner – treat
appropriately and concurrently with the index woman.
• If adequate screening for gonorrhoea and chlamydia in the
sexual partner(s) is not possible, treat empirically for both
gonorrhoea and chlamydia.

• If symptoms have not resolved within 72 hours,
consider removing the IUD.
• Removal of the IUD may be associated with better
short-term clinical outcomes, but balance the decision
to remove it against the risk of pregnancy in those
who have had otherwise UPSI in the preceding days.
• Consider hormonal emergency contraception for
women in this situation.

Young women

Women with HIV

• Women under the age of 25 years: keep a low threshold for diagnosis and treatment of
PID, owing to the higher incidence of disease in this group and the potential impact on
future fertility.
• Avoid ofloxacin, where possible, when bone development is still occurring.
• Doxycycline can safely be used in children over the age of 12 years.

• Manage in conjunction with the HIV physician.
• These women may have clinically more severe PID but respond equally well
to treatment as women who are not infected. Therefore, treat with standard
antibiotics.

What not to do
•
•
•
•
•

Do not wait for swab results. Start empirical antibiotics as soon as a presumptive diagnosis of PID is made clinically.
Combination of oral doxycycline and metronidazole (without ceftriaxone).
Azithromycin monotherapy.
Oral cephalosporin as part of the treatment regimen.
Women who are at high risk of gonococcal PID – use of regimens containing ofloxacin or azithromycin alone.

SECTION 7

Sexual and reproductive health

CHAPTER 40 Vaginal discharge

Background
• Normal physiological discharge changes with the menstrual cycle.
• Abnormal vaginal discharge is characterized by a change of colour, consistency,
volume, or odour, and may be associated with symptoms such as itch, soreness,
dysuria, pelvic pain, or IMB/PCB.
• In women of reproductive age complaining of vaginal discharge, the most common
cause is physiological, but exclude infective and other causes.

History and assessment of risk for STIs
• Characteristics of the discharge – onset, duration, colour, odour, consistency,
cyclicity, exacerbating factors.
• Associated symptoms – itch, superficial dyspareunia, dysuria.
• Symptoms indicative of upper reproductive tract infection – abdominal pain, fever,
deep dyspareunia, abnormal bleeding.
• Sexual history – high risk of STI if aged < 25 years, new partner or > 1 partner in
the last year, previous STIs.
• Obstetric history – pregnancy, postpartum, post-abortion, contraceptive use.
• History of uterine instrumentation (TOP, ERPC, HSG, hysteroscopy).
• Concurrent medications (antibiotics, corticosteroids); medical conditions (diabetes,
immunocompromised state).
• Previous treatments used (prescription and over-the-counter).

Examination may be omitted with empirical treatment
•
•
•
•
•
•

Women at low risk of STIs.
No symptoms of other conditions causing vaginal discharge.
No symptoms suggestive of upper reproductive tract infection.
The woman can return for follow-up if symptoms do not resolve.
Symptoms have not developed following a gynaecological procedure.
Characteristic symptoms of VVC; AND this is a first episode of suspected VVC, or if recurrent,
recurrence is infrequent (< 4 times a year).
• Characteristic symptoms of BV; AND this is a first episode of suspected BV, or if recurrent, a
previous episode of similar symptoms was confirmed to be BV.
A previous diagnosis of BV can be assumed to be reliable if:
* Characteristic symptoms and signs of BV were present.
* Symptoms and signs of other conditions causing vaginal discharge were absent.
* There was no microbiological evidence of presence of any other infection from swabs.
* Symptoms and signs cleared following antibiotic treatment.

Differential diagnosis (see Table)
Physiological
• Commonest cause; diagnosis of exclusion.
• Cyclicity of the discharge – Prior to ovulation oestrogen concentration increases altering
cervical mucus to fertile, clearer, wetter, stretchy, and slippery. After ovulation, progesterone
concentration increases, altering cervical mucus to become thick and sticky.
• Vagina is colonized by lactobacilli and other bacteria from puberty. Lactobacilli metabolize
glycogen in the vaginal epithelium to produce lactic acid, thus the vaginal environment is
normally acidic (pH < 4.5).
• Some commensal organisms can constitute infection if they overgrow.
Infective
• Vaginal infection:
* Non-STI – bacterial vaginosis (BV), vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC).
* STI – trichomoniasis (TV).
• Endocervical infections caused by chlamydia or gonorrhoea:
• PID.
Non-infective
• Foreign bodies (tampons).
• Cervical polyps and ectopy.
• Genital tract malignancy.
• Fistulae.
• Allergic reactions.
• Atrophic vaginitis in post-menopausal women.

Emperical treatment

• Swabs may be omitted with empirical treatment (HPA).
• Non-offensive white discharge with an itch – VVC – treat with antifungals.
• Offensive discharge without itch – BV – treat with metronidazole.

Recurrent or failed treatment

Examine all other women

http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/CBO9781316156513.041

Cervicitis or PID

• Vaginal discharge associated with PCB/IMB, lower abdominal
pain with or without fever, dysuria, deep dyspareunia.
• Cervicitis – inflamed cervix, which bleeds easily and may be
associated with a mucopurulent discharge.
• Adnexal tenderness and cervical excitation on bimanual
palpation.

Examine all other women (contd.)
• Local inspection – signs of vulval inflammation, excoriations, vulval satellite lesions of erythema.
• Speculum examination – signs of cervicitis, vaginitis, amount, consistency and colour of vaginal discharge, and any
foreign body.
• Bimanual palpation – cervical motion tenderness, uterine tenderness, adnexal tenderness, and abnormal mass.
• pH testing of vaginal discharge with narrow-range pH paper to assess the probability of causes such as BV or TV
(pH ≥ 4.5) or candida (pH < 4.5). It cannot help distinguish between BV and TV.

Investigations

Swabs may be omitted with empirical treatment (HPA)

Swabs are recommended

• Combination of clinical features and a measurement of vaginal pH is a sensitive,
although not very specific predictor of the cause of vaginal discharge. Using these
criteria, the diagnosis is missed in only a few women with BV or VVC. However,
a moderate number of women who do not have VVC or BV will be incorrectly
diagnosed with these conditions.
• Specificity is significantly increased when results of endocervical swabs for
chlamydia and gonorrhoea and HVS are available.

• When clinical features are not clearly suggestive of either BV or VVC, or:
* An increased risk of STI. * Cervicitis on examination.
* Suspected PID. * A poor response to initial treatment.
* Recurrent vaginal discharge. * Discharge of uncertain cause.
* Discharge after a gynaecological procedure or childbirth.
* Within 3 weeks of IUCD insertion. * Woman requests investigations.
• HVS from the lateral vaginal wall and posterior fornix:
* Microscopy and dry Gram stain – BV (clue cells and proportions of lactobacilli and other
organisms), candida (spores and pseudophytes).
* Saline wet microscopy – TV (flagellate protozoa), candida (pseudohyphae).
* Culture – candida, BV, chlamydia, gonorrhoea (chocolate agar media).
* HVS for suspected TV should be examined in the laboratory within 6 hours. It is therefore
recommended that these women are referred to GUM clinic.
• Endocervical swab for chlamydia and gonorrhoea.
• Swabs from other sites may be appropriate, based on clinical history (urethral, rectal,
oropharyngeal).

Management

Empirically treat while awaiting swab results in cases of:

Refer:

•
•
•
•

• Urgent admission for women with PID who are pregnant, pyrexial and unwell,
or unable to take oral fluids or medications.
• Suspected gynaecological cancer.
• Referral to a GUM clinic for women with:
* Suspected TV.
* For partner notification in cases of confirmed gonorrhoea, chlamydia, or TV.

211

Cervicitis – treat for chlamydia.
Suspected PID (see Chapter 39).
BV, VVC.
Suspected TV – if referral to GUM is not feasible.

single 2 g dose).

Oral metronidazole (a single 2 g oral dose
or 400 mg twice daily for 5–7 days).

Local treatment

Vulval antifungals can be used if women have vulval
­symptoms.

Metronidazole vaginal gel, oral clindamycin, or clindamycin
cream.

Sexual partners

Testing and treatment of male sexual partner(s) is not
­indicated.

Testing and treatment of the male sexual partner(s) is not
­indicated.

Contraception

Latex condoms, diaphragms, and cervical caps may be
­ amaged by some vaginal/vulval antifungal treatments.

Women should use additional barrier contraceptive protection
(e.g., condoms) during the antibiotic course and for 7 days
afterwards.

Notification and treatment for all partners
in the last 6 months is recommended.

Vaginal discharge in pregnancy

Bacterial vaginosis

Vulvovaginal candidiasis

Trichomonas vaginalis

• Treat as for non-pregnant women.
• Although BV is associated with late miscarriage, preterm
labour, premature rupture of membranes, low birth
weight, and postpartum endometritis, routine screening
for BV in pregnancy is not yet recommended.
• Current guidelines – screen for BV only for women with a
previous preterm birth (< 28 weeks’ gestation) or secondtrimester miscarriage.

• VVC is common in pregnancy.
• Treatment is the same as for non-pregnant women but may
need to be of longer duration (for up to 7 days).
• Cochrane review – vaginal imidazole more effective than
nystatin.
• Avoid oral antifungals because of potential teratogenicity.

• There is no indication for routine screening in pregnancy.
• Treatment – oral metronidazole for 7 days.
• There is increasing evidence that TV may be associated
with preterm delivery and low birth weight.

			
What not to do

Recurrent vaginal discharge

• Routine screening for BV in pregnancy.
• Routine screening of TV in pregnancy.

• Can result in psychosexual problems and depression. Provide appropriate counselling.
• Consider the diagnosis and treat acute infections.
• Investigate for potential underlying conditions (e.g., diabetes, immunosuppression, corticosteroid
therapy, or concurrent antibiotic use).
• Advise to avoid use of douches, shower gels, antiseptic agents, and shampoo in the bath.

Bacterial vaginosis

Vulvovaginal candidiasis

Trichomonas vaginalis

• Despite high initial cure rates (70–80%), recurrence occurs
within 3 months of treatment in 15–30% of women.
• Most relapses occur in the first year and are not thought to be
due to drug resistance.
• Consider suppressive regimens, but evidence to support their
effectiveness is limited.
* 5 g metronidazole intravaginal gel twice weekly for 4–6
months after an initial 10-day treatment.
* 400 mg metronidazole orally twice daily for 3 days at the
start and end of menstruation.

• ≥ 4 episodes in 12 months; occurs in < 5% of women. Not clear whether
it is a result of re-colonization or new growth.
• Induction and maintenance regimen may be used for 6 months.
• Induction – daily vaginal clotrimazole/oral fluconazole/itraconazole for
6–12 days.
• Maintenance – weekly or monthly treatments for 6 months (oral
fluconazole 100 mg weekly, clotrimazole pessary 500 mg weekly, or oral
itraconazole 400 mg).
• Relapse occurs in up to 50% of women after cessation of maintenance
therapy. Induction and maintenance treatment may need to be restarted
and continued for a longer period (12 months).

• Usually a result of re-infection,
but consider the possibility of
drug resistance.
• Treatment, education, and

SECTION 7

Sexual and reproductive health

CHAPTER 41 Bacterial vaginosis

Background and prevalence
• Most common cause of abnormal discharge in women of reproductive age.
• Characterized by an overgrowth of anaerobic organisms (Gardnerella vaginalis, Prevotella
species, Mycoplasma hominis, Mobiluncus species) in the vagina, leading to replacement of
lactobacilli and an increase in pH from < 4.5 to as high as 7.0.
• Prevalence: 5–50%; 12% in pregnant women in the UK and 30% in women undergoing
TOP.
• Prevalence is higher in sexually active women with early age at first intercourse, higher
number of sexual partners, black women, smokers, and those with an IUCD.
• Spontaneous onset and remission of BV can occur.
• Not a sexually transmitted disease.

Risks or complications
• It may be associated with non-gonococcal urethritis (NGU) in male partners.
• Associated with increased incidence of vaginal cuff cellulitis and abscess formation following
transvaginal hysterectomy.
• No studies regarding the possible role of BV in the onset of PID following insertion of an
IUCD.
• PID – prevalence of BV is reported to be high in women with PID. It may be predictive of
subsequent PID associated with gonorrhoea or chlamydia. However, there is no evidence
on whether treating asymptomatic women with BV reduces their risk of developing PID
subsequently.
• Pregnancy – BV is associated with late miscarriage, preterm birth, preterm premature rupture
of membranes, and postpartum endometritis.
• BV is common in women undergoing elective TOP, and is associated with post-TOP
endometritis and PID.

History and examination
•
•
•
•

Approximately 50% are asymptomatic.
Offensive fishy-smelling vaginal discharge.
Not associated with soreness, itching, or irritation.
Thin, white, homogeneous discharge coating the walls of the vagina and vestibule.

Diagnosis
• BASHH recommend using the Hay/Ison criteria.
• Isolation of Gardnerella vaginalis cannot be used to diagnose BV
because it can be cultured from the vagina in > 50% of normal women.

• Amsel criteria – at least 3/4 criteria for the diagnosis:
* Thin, white, homogeneous discharge.
* Clue cells on microscopy of wet mount.
* pH of vaginal fluid > 4.5.
* Release of a fishy odour on adding alkali (10% KOH).

Fig. A

Fig. B

Fig. C

• A Gram stained vaginal smear – the Hay/Ison criteria:
* Grade 1 (Fig. A: normal): lactobacilli predominate.
* Grade 2 (Fig. B: intermediate): mixed flora with some lactobacilli, but Gardnerella or
Mobiluncus is also present.
* Grade 3 (Fig. C: BV): predominantly Gardnerella and/or Mobiluncus, few or absent
lactobacilli.
• The Nugent score – estimate the relative proportions of bacterial morphotypes to give a score
between 0 and 10. A score of < 4 is normal, 4–6 is intermediate, and > 6 is BV.

http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/CBO9781316156513.042

Treatment

• Indicated for:
* Symptomatic women.
* Women undergoing surgical procedures.
* Asymptomatic women opting for treatment.
• General advice – avoid vaginal douching, use of shower
gel, and use of antiseptic agents or shampoo in the bath.

Recommended regimens

• Metronidazole 400–500 mg BD × 5–7 days.
• OR metronidazole 2 g single dose.
Alternative regimens

•
•
•
•

Intravaginal metronidazole gel (0.75%) OD × 5 days.
OR intravaginal clindamycin cream (2%) OD × 7 days.
OR clindamycin 300 mg BD × 7 days.
OR tinidazole 2 g single dose.

Specific situations

Termination of pregnancy
• Screen for and treat BV with either metronidazole or
clindamycin cream to reduce the incidence of subsequent
endometritis and PID.

• All these treatments achieve cure rates of 70–80%.
• Oral metronidazole is well tolerated and inexpensive;
2 g stat dose may be slightly less effective at 4-week
follow-up.
• Intravaginal metronidazole gel and clindamycin cream
have similar efficacy but the latter is more expensive.
• Metronidazole is less active against lactobacilli than
clindamycin. Conversely, clindamycin is more active
against most of the bacteria associated with BV.
• Oral clindamycin and tinidazole are more expensive than
metronidazole.

Sexual partners

Pregnancy and breastfeeding

• No reduction in relapse rate is reported when male
partners are treated. Therefore, do not offer routine
screening and treatment of male partners.
• Higher incidence of BV in female partners of lesbian
women is reported. However, no study has investigated
the value of treating partners of lesbian women
simultaneously.

Recurrent BV
• Relapse rate can be as high as 60% within 3 months.
• Suppressive therapy: metronidazole gel 0.75%, initial treatment daily for 10 days,
followed by twice weekly for 4–6 months.
• Metronidazole orally 400 mg BD for 3 days at the start and end of menstruation.
• Acigel used at the time of menstruation and following UPSI may be associated with a
reduction in relapse rate following a course of metronidazole.
• Studies of live yoghurt or Lactobacillus acidophilus have not demonstrated benefit.

• Conflicting evidence on screening and treating BV in
pregnancy.
• Treat symptomatic pregnant women in the usual way.
• Insufficient evidence to recommend routine treatment of
asymptomatic pregnant women with BV.
• No evidence of teratogenicity from the use of
metronidazole during the first trimester of pregnancy.
• Metronidazole and clindamycin enter breast milk. Avoid
high doses or use an intravaginal treatment for lactating
women.

What not to do
•
•
•
•

Isolation of Gardnerella vaginalis to diagnose BV.
Routine screening and treatment of male partners.
Routine treatment of asymptomatic pregnant women with BV.
Live yoghurt or Lactobacillus acidophilus in treatment of recurrent BV.

Follow-up
• A test of cure is not required if symptoms resolve.

SECTION 7

Sexual and reproductive health

CHAPTER 42 Vulvovaginal candidiasis

Clinical features

Background and prevalence

• Symptoms – vulval itch, vulval soreness, vaginal discharge, superficial dyspareunia,
external dysuria.
• Signs – erythema, fissuring, discharge and typically curdy but may be thin and non-offensive,
oedema, satellite lesions, excoriation.
• 10–20% of women of reproductive age may be colonized with Candida species but remain
asymptomatic. These women do not require treatment.
• VVC is uncomplicated unless the following are present: severe symptoms, pregnancy,
recurrent VVC (> 4 attacks per year), non-albicans species.

• Causative agents:
* Candida albicans 80–92%.
* Non-albicans species: C. glabrata, C. tropicalis, C. krusei, C. parapsilosis, and
Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
• Occurs most commonly when the vagina is exposed to oestrogen, especially in women aged
20–30 years and during pregnancy.
• Lifetime incidence of VVC is 50–75%.
• About 50% of women who have had an acute attack will have a further episode.

Diagnosis
• Symptomatic women – a vaginal swab for:
* Microscopy for Gram or wet film.
* Culture plated to solid fungal media.
• Candida species (albicans/non-albicans) on culture is essential if complicated disease is
suspected/present.

Management

General advice

Sexual partners

Uncomplicated VVC

• To use vulval moisturizers as soap substitute.
• To avoid tight fitting synthetic clothing.
• To avoid local irritants, e.g., perfumed products.

• No evidence to support the treatment of
asymptomatic male sexual partners in either
episodic or recurrent VVC.

• All topical and oral azoles give a cure rate of 80–95%. Choice of treatment
depends on availability and patient preference.
• Efficacy of the treatment depends on the total dose given, rather than duration.
A single high dose is as effective as a divided dose given over several days; and
compliance may be improved.
• Topical azoles can cause vulvovaginal irritation; consider this possibility if
symptoms worsen or persist.
• Vaginal nystatin preparations give a 70–90% cure rate. It is more effective
against C. glabrata (and other non-albicans species) but is not used routinely for
VCC as it requires a 14-day course.
• Topical – clotrimazole, econazole, fenticonazole pessaries, nystatin cream.
• Oral – fluconazole, itraconazole. Avoid in pregnancy and breastfeeding.

Treatment failure

• No resolution of symptoms within 7–14 days is unusual in acute VVC. Likely causes:
* Poor compliance with treatment. * Continued presence of an irritant.
* Misdiagnosis of the initial condition. * Organisms resistant to standard treatment.
* Presence of mixed infection. * Recurrent infection.
* Underlying condition (e.g., concurrent antibiotic use, diabetes, or immunosuppression).

Follow-up
• Unnecessary if symptoms resolve. Test of cure is unnecessary.

http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/CBO9781316156513.043

Recurrent VVC

Pathogenesis
Background and prevalence
• Definition – at least four episodes of symptomatic VVC annually, with at least partial
resolution of symptoms between episodes.
• Positive microscopy or a moderate/heavy growth of C. albicans on at least two
occasions when symptomatic.
• ≈ 5% of women of reproductive age with a primary episode of VVC will develop
recurrent disease.

• It is usually due to C. albicans.
• Caused by host factors rather than a more virulent strain or re-introduction of the
organism to the genital tract.
• Host factors include persistence of Candida, uncontrolled DM, immunosuppression,
hyperoestrogenaemia (HRT, OCP), broad-spectrum antibiotics resulting in disturbance
of vaginal flora, and a possible link to allergy.

Investigations
• Speciated fungal culture. • FBC, random blood glucose.

Management

General advice

The principle of therapy

Alternative treatments

• Vulval emollients may give symptomatic relief.
• To avoid high-oestrogen contraceptives. Low-oestrogen pills
do not highly predispose to VVC but may possibly have a
negative influence on relapsing episodes. Consider use of
Depo-Provera.

• Induction regimen to ensure clinical remission, followed by a
maintenance regimen.
• Induction – fluconazole 150 mg every 72 hours × 3 doses.
• Maintenance – fluconazole 150 mg once a week for 6 months.
• ≈ 90% of women will remain disease-free at 6 months and
40% at 1 year.

• Probiotics/Lactobacillus – evidence does not support use
of oral or vaginal Lactobacillus for the prevention of
VVC.
• Diet – there is insufficient evidence to make any dietary
recommendations, including on carbohydrate or yeast
intake.
• Role of allergy:
* Zafirlukast 20 mg BD for 6 months may induce
remission. Zafirlukast may be considered as
maintenance prophylaxis for recurrent VVC,
particularly in women with a history of atopy.
* Cetirizine 10 mg daily for 6 months may cause
remission in women who fail to get complete
resolution of symptoms with suppressive fluconazole.
• Tea tree oil (and other essential oils) – are antifungal in
vitro but may cause hypersensitivity reactions. Insufficient
evidence to recommend use in recurrent VVC.

Alternative regimens

• Induction – topical imidazole can be increased to 10–14 days.
• Maintenance – clotrimazole pessary 500 mg once a week, fluconazole capsules 50 mg daily,
itraconazole capsules 50–100 mg daily, ketoconazole capsules 100 mg daily.
• Maintenance therapy should last 6 months; 90% of women should remain disease-free during
treatment.
• Risk of idiosyncratic drug-induced hepatitis, particularly with itraconazole and ketoconazole.
• Consider the addition of cetirizine 10 mg OD.
• If recurrent disease is re-established, the induction and maintenance regimens should be
repeated.

SECTION 7

Sexual and reproductive health

VVC– specific conditions

Severe VVC

Diabetes mellitus

HIV infection

• Regardless of a history of recurrence, repeat fluconazole
150 mg after 3 days as this improves symptomatic
response but not recurrence.
• There is no benefit of 7-day local treatment over a
single oral dose of fluconzole. If oral treatment is
contraindicated, repeat a single dose pessary after 3 days.
• Low-potency corticosteroids may improve symptomatic
relief in conjunction with adequate antifungal therapy.

• Symptomatic VVC is more prevalent in diabetics and
most problematic in those with poor control.
• Increased prevalence of species other than C. albicans, in
particular C. glabrata.
• Optimize glycaemic control.
• If C. albicans is isolated – single-dose fluconazole
(150 mg) gives a similar response to that in non-diabetics.
• Symptomatic women with C. glabrata – boric acid
600 mg intravaginal suppository once a day for 14 days is
as effective as fluconazole 150 mg stat.

• VVC occurs more frequently and with greater persistence
in HIV-infected women.
• Treatment – conventional methods including use of
suppressive antifungal regimens if necessary.

Non-albicans species

Pregnancy

• Majority are C. glabrata and are still susceptible to azoles. C. krusei is intrinsically
resistant to fluconazole.
• Longer courses may be needed, although there are no data on optimum duration;
2 weeks is suggested.
• Suggested alternatives include:
* Nystatin pessaries are the only licensed alternative to azole therapy and are
therefore the first-line treatment for non-albicans infection.
* Amphotericin B vaginal suppositories 50 mg OD for 14 days has a 70% success
rate.
* Limited evidence with boric acid vaginal suppositories 600 mg daily for 2–3
weeks. If mucosal irritation occurs, the dose can be reduced to 300 mg daily.
There may be a teratogenic risk.
* Intravaginal flucytosine either separately or with amphotericin to reduce the
chances of resistance can be used for 2 weeks.

• Asymptomatic (30–40%) and symptomatic colonization is more common in
pregnancy.
• It is not associated with low birth weight or premature delivery.
• Treatment – topical imidazoles.
• Do not treat asymptomatic women.
• There is no evidence that any one topical imidazole is more effective than another.
• Longer courses are recommended; a 4-day course will cure just over 50% whereas a
7-day course cures over 90% of cases.
• Oral therapy is contraindicated.

What not to do
• Treatment of asymptomatic male sexual partners in either episodic or recurrent VVC.
• Recurrent VVC – use of tea tree oil, probiotics/Lactobacillus for prevention, or any
dietary recommendations, including carbohydrate or yeast intake.
• Treatment of asymptomatic women in pregnancy.
• Oral antifungal therapy in pregnancy.

CHAPTER 43 Trichomonas vaginalis

Risks or complications

Background and prevalence
• A flagellated protozoan.
• Colonizes:
* Women – vagina, urethra, and paraurethral glands. Urethral infection is present in 90%
of episodes. The urinary tract is the sole site of infection in < 5% of cases.
* Men – urethra, sub-preputial sac, and lesions of the penis.
• STI – Owing to site specificity, it inoculates only intravaginal or intraurethral sites.

• Increasing evidence that TV infection may be associated with preterm delivery and low
birth weight. Further research is needed to confirm these associations and to prove that the
association is causal. However, studies reported that treatment in pregnancy does not improve
pregnancy outcome.
• Screening of asymptomatic individuals for TV infection is not currently recommended.
• TV infection may enhance HIV transmission.

History and examination
• Symptoms:
* 10–50% are asymptomatic.
* Vaginal discharge, vulval itching, dysuria, or offensive odour.
* Occasionally low abdominal discomfort.
• Signs:
* Vaginal discharge in up to 70% of women – varying in consistency from thin and scanty
to profuse and thick; the classical discharge of frothy yellow occurs in 10–30% of cases.
* Vulvitis and vaginitis.
* Strawberry cervix appearance to the naked eye, in about 2%.
* Higher rate on colposcopic examination.
* 5–15% of women will have no abnormalities on examination.

•
•
•

219

Wet mount or acridine orange staining is approximately 70% sensitive.
Perform microscopy as soon as possible after the sample is taken as motility diminishes with time.
Culture is the ‘gold standard’.
PCR-based diagnostic tests have been developed with sensitivities and specificities approaching 100%.
If Trichomonads seen on cervical cytology, confirm by culture of vaginal secretions.
Site to sample – posterior fornix. Self-taken vaginal swabs are likely to give equivalent results.

SECTION 7

Sexual and reproductive health

Management

General advice

• Screen for other STIs.
• Treat sexual partner(s) simultaneously.
• Advise patients to avoid sexual intercourse
(including oral sex) until they and their
partner(s) have completed treatment and
follow-up.

		

• Metronidazole and related drugs (95% cure rate).
• There is a spontaneous cure rate of 20–25%.
• Recommended regimes:
* Metronidazole 2 g orally single dose.
* OR metronidazole 400–500 mg BD for 5–7 days.
• Single dose is cheaper with better compliance; however,
failure rate is higher, especially if partners are not treated.
• Alternative regimens – tinidazole 2 g orally, single dose.
Similar activity to metronidazole but is more expensive.

Management of sexual partners

• Screen current partners for STIs and treat for TV
irrespective of the results of investigations.
• If a male contact is found to have NGU, it is reasonable
to treat initially for TV and repeat the urethral smear
before treating additionally for NGU.

Treatment failure
• Check compliance and exclude vomiting with metronidazole.
• Check possibility of re-infection.
• Check partner(s) has been treated.
Test of cure is only recommended if the
patient remains symptomatic following
Repeat course of standard treatment

treatment, or if symptoms recur.

Metronidazole-refractory TV
• A major therapeutic challenge, treatment options are extremely limited.
• Sensitivity testing is currently unavailable.
• Use of a broad-spectrum antibiotic such as erythromycin or amoxicillin
before re-treating with metronidazole may improve the chances of a cure.
• Higher doses of metronidazole:
* Metronidazole 400 mg TDS with metronidazole 1 g PR daily for 7
days or longer.
* Metronidazole 2 g OD for 3–5 days.
* High-dose intravenous metronidazole.
• High doses of oral tinidazole, e.g., 2 g BD for 2 weeks, with or without
intravaginal tinidazole with a cure rate of 92%.

What not to do
• Screening of asymptomatic individuals for TV.

Sexual and reproductive health

CHAPTER 45 Gonorrhoea

Prevalence and incidence
• Second most common bacterial STI in the UK.
• Most common in young people under the age of 25 years, in men who have sex with men.
• Incidence of gonorrhoea has decreased in all age groups since 2002 in the UK. In 2005,
18,665 gonorrhoea infections were diagnosed in the UK in GUM clinics.
• Affects the mucous membranes of the urethra, endocervix, rectum, pharynx, and conjunctiva.

Symptoms

Risks or complications
• PID in women.
• Epididymo-orchitis or prostatitis in men.
• Disseminated gonococcal infection (<1%) – (haematogenous dissemination) skin lesions,
arthralgia, arthritis, and tenosynovitis (uncommon).

There is no evidence to support widespread unselected testing for
gonorrhoea in the community.

Women – symptoms usually develop within 10 days.

•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Asymptomatic in up to 50% of cases.
Increased or altered vaginal discharge (up to 50%).
Lower abdominal pain (up to 25%).
Urethral infection – dysuria (12%).
IMB or HMB – rarely.
Pharyngeal infection – asymptomatic in > 90% of cases.
Rectal infection is by transmucosal spread rather than from anal intercourse and is usually
asymptomatic.
Men – symptoms develop 2–5 days after infection.
• Urethral infection – urethral discharge (> 80%),dysuria (> 50%), asymptomatic (< 10%).
• Rectal infection – usually asymptomatic but may cause anal discharge (12%) or perianal/anal
pain or discomfort (7%).
• Pharyngeal infection – asymptomatic in > 90% of cases.

Signs
Women:

• Mucopurulent endocervical discharge, easily induced bleeding (< 50%).
• Pelvic/lower abdominal tenderness (< 5%).
• No abnormal findings is common.
Men:

• Mucopurulent or purulent urethral discharge.
• Epididymal tenderness/swelling or balanitis is rare.

Gram-negative diplococci shown within polymorphonuclear leucocytes

Specimen site

• Women:
* Vaginal or endocervical swab – NAAT.
* Endocervical and urethral swab – culture.
* Urine is a suboptimal sample in women.
• Men:
* First-pass urine for NAAT.
* Urethral swab – microscopy and culture.
• Rectal and pharyngeal swab.

http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/CBO9781316156513.046

Investigations – no test for gonorrhoea offers 100% sensitivity and specificity.

Microscopy

NAATs

• Gram stain of genital specimens – Gram-negative
diplococci within polymorphonuclear leucocytes.
• Poor sensitivity in women – 37–50% for endocervical
smears and 20% for urethral smears; therefore, not
recommended for urethral smears.
• Sensitivity of 90–95% in men with urethral discharge
and is recommended to facilitate immediate diagnosis
in symptomatic men. Staining of urethral smears in
asymptomatic men is less sensitive (50–75%).
• Microscopy is not appropriate for pharyngeal
specimens and asymptomatic rectal infections.

• NAATs –more sensitive than culture and can test wider range of
specimen types. High sensitivity (> 9 6%) in both symptomatic and
asymptomatic infection.
• Equivalent sensitivity to culture in urine and urethral swab from men
and in vaginal and endocervical swabs from women. Superior sensitivity
to culture in extra-genital (anogenital and pharyngeal) specimens.
• Sensitivity in female urine is significantly lower and urine is not the
optimal specimen in women.
• A dual NAAT for both pathogens (chlamydia and gonorrhoea) maximizes
sensitivity and ease of specimen collection, transport, and processing.
• Positive NAATs require supplementary testing to confirm the diagnosis.

Culture

• Specific and sensitive diagnostic test.
• Allows confirmatory identification and antimicrobial
susceptibility testing.
• Both direct plating of genital samples and use of
transport media with prompt laboratory plating give
acceptable results.
• Culture is necessary in patients with signs and
symptoms compatible with gonorrhoea and/or with
a confirmed NAAT result, prior to antibiotics being
given, so that susceptibility testing can be performed
and resistant strains identified.

Management

General advice

Indications for treatment

Uncomplicated anogenital infection in adults: treatment

• To abstain from UPSI until the patient and partner(s) have
completed treatment; if azithromycin is used, this will be
7 days after treatment was given.
• Screen for other STIs. Test for C. trachomatis routinely on
all adults with gonorrhoea or treat to eradicate possible
co-infection.

• Identification of intracellular Gram-negative diplococci on
microscopy of a smear from the genital tract.
• A positive culture for N. gonorrhoeae from any site.
• A positive NAAT for N. gonorrhoeae from any site.
• Recent sexual partner(s) of confirmed cases of gonococcal infection.
• Following sexual assault.

• Ceftriaxone 500 mg IM as a single dose with
azithromycin 1 g oral as a single dose.
• Azithromycin is recommended as co-treatment
irrespective of the results of chlamydia testing.
• There is a risk of resistance.
• Alternative regimens – cefixime, spectinomycin.

Partner notification

• Male patients with symptomatic urethral infection should notify all partners
with whom they had sexual contact within the preceding 2 weeks or their last
partner if longer ago.
• Patients with infection at other sites or asymptomatic infection should notify
all partners within the preceding 3 months.
• Offer sexual partners testing and treat epidemiologically for gonorrhoea.
• To confidently exclude infection in patients who attend within 3 days of sexual
contact, consider a second set of tests if effective antimicrobial therapy is not
given. Conventionally this would be 14 days after contact.

Follow-up and test of cure (TOC)
• Assess after treatment to confirm compliance with treatment, ensure resolution of symptoms, enquire about
adverse reactions, take a sexual history to explore the possibility of re-infection, pursue partner notification
and health promotion.
• TOC is recommended in all cases to identify emerging resistance.
• If TOC needs to be selective, prioritize the following patients – persisting symptoms or signs, pharyngeal
infection (all treatments are less effective at eradicating pharyngeal infection), treatment with anything other
than the first-line recommendations.
• Method and timing of TOC:
* Persisting symptoms or signs – culture, at least 72 hours after completion of therapy.
* If asymptomatic – NAATs followed by culture if positive. Test 2 weeks after completion of antibiotic therapy.
• Infection identified after treatment may well be due to re-infection.

SECTION 7

Sexual and reproductive health

CHAPTER 46 Chlamydia

Prevalence and incidence

Risks or complications

• Most common STI in the UK.
• About 5–10% of sexually active women aged < 24 years and men between 20 and 24 years
may be infected.
• Risk factors – age < 25 years, new sexual partner, > 1 sexual partner in the past year, and
lack of consistent use of condoms.
• Site of infection – men: urethra; women: endocervix, urethra. It also infects the conjunctiva,
rectum, and pharynx.
• Transmission – primarily by penetrative sexual intercourse; however, infection can be
detected at the conjunctiva and nasopharynx without concomitant genital tract infection.
• Two thirds of sexual partners of chlamydia-positive individuals are also chlamydia positive.

• PID in 10–40% cases; can result in tubal factor infertility, ectopic pregnancy, and chronic
pelvic pain. Risk of PID and subfertility increases with each recurrence of infection.
• Other complications:
* Fitz–Hugh–Curtis syndrome (peri-hepatitis).
* Vertical transmission – neonatal conjunctivitis, pneumonia.
* Epididymo-orchitis.
* Adult conjunctivitis.
* Reactive arthritis/Reiter’s syndrome (more common in men).

Sites to be sampled

Clinical features
• Asymptomatic in up to 70% of women and 50% of men with ongoing transmission in the
community. If untreated, infection may persist or resolve spontaneously.
• Women – PCB, IMB; purulent vaginal discharge; mucopurulent cervical discharge; contact
bleeding; dysuria, deep dyspareunia, pelvic pain and tenderness; inflamed or friable cervix.
• Men – urethral discharge, urethral discomfort, dysuria.
• Rectal infections – usually asymptomatic, but may cause anal discharge and anorectal
discomfort (proctitis).
• Pharyngeal infections – asymptomatic and are uncommon.

• Women:
* Cervical or vulvovaginal swab. Vulvovaginal swab has sensitivity of 90–95%.
* If a speculum examination is not possible, then a self-taken vulvovaginal swab or urine
sample can be used. Variable sensitivities (65–100%) with the first-catch urine specimen.
• Men:
* First-voided urine sample or urethral swab.
* Rectal, pharyngeal, and conjunctival specimens – currently none of the NAATs have FDA
approval for these sites.

Investigations

Owing to the evidence of high and increasing rates of
infection, the National Chlamydial Screening Programme
(NCSP) has been introduced in the UK. All sexually active
under 25-year-olds are to be tested for chlamydia annually
or when there is a change of sexual partner.

No test is 100% sensitive or specific.

NAAT

Cell culture

• NAATs are more sensitive and specific than enzyme immunoassays (EIAs).
• Confirm reactive tests using the same NAAT platform, but if possible
with a second platform. However, offer treatment to all patients with
unconfirmed reactive NAAT results.
• In general, NAATs are 90–95% sensitive. As the number of sites sampled or
the number of different NAATs used increases, the detection rate increases.

•
•
•
•

Sensitivity 60–80%; 100% specificity.
Expensive, limited availability.
Can be used on all specimen types.
Routine use is not recommended owing to high cost and low
sensitivity.

Enzyme immunoassays (EIAs)

•
•
•
•

Labour intensive, requires skilled personnel.
Unsuitable for large numbers of specimens.
Can use all specimen types including rectal and pharyngeal.
Sensitivity is 40–70%, and their use is not recommended.

Management

General advice

Treatment

Pregnancy and breastfeeding

• To avoid UPSI (including oral sex) until patients and their
partner(s) have completed treatment (or wait 7 days if
treated with azithromycin).
• Explain long-term implications.
• Screen for other STIs. If the patient is within the window
period for HIV and syphilis, repeat at an appropriate
time interval.
• Uncomplicated infection is not an indication for removal of
an IUS or IUD.

• Recommended regimens:
* Doxycycline 100 mg BD for 7 days.
* Or azithromycin 1 g orally stat.
• Doxycycline and azithromycin have > 95% cure. There is
no difference in the re-infection rates between the two.
• Alternative regimens: if either of the above treatments are
contraindicated.
* Erythromycin 500 mg BD for 10–14 days.
* Or ofloxacin 200 mg BD or 400 mg OD for 7 days.
• Ofloxacin has similar efficacy to doxycycline and a
better side-effect profile, but is more expensive so is not
recommended as first-line treatment.
• Erythromycin – less efficacious than azithromycin or
doxycycline; 20–25% of patients experience side effects
that are sufficient to discontinue treatment.

• Doxycycline and ofloxacin are contraindicated.
• Erythromycin 500 mg QDS for 7 days/500 mg BD for
14 days.
• Or amoxicillin 500 mg TDS for 7 days.
• Or azithromycin 1 g stat.
• Owing to higher positive chlamydia tests after treatment
in pregnancy (possibily due to less efficacious treatment
regimen, non-compliance or re-infection) – pregnant
woman must have a test of cure 5 weeks after completing
therapy, 6 weeks later if given azithromycin.
• Azithromycin is probably < 95% effective. Azithromycin
1 g stat is recommended by WHO; unlicensed in the
UK. BNF recommends use only if no other alternative is
available.

Management of sexual partners

• Partner notification – offer all sexual partners a full STI screen. Offer epidemiological treatment.
• If declined, advise patients to abstain from sex until they have received a negative result. If found to be
positive, screen and offer epidemiological treatment to any other potentially exposed partner(s).
• A cut-off of 4 weeks is used to identify those sexual partner(s) potentially at risk if the index patient is
symptomatic. If the index case is asymptomatic, a cut-off of 6 months, or until the last previous sexual
partner (whichever is the longer time period), is used.
• Re-testing positive can result from either suboptimal antimicrobial therapy or re-infection. Re-infection may
result from having sexual intercourse with either an untreated, suboptimally treated, or a new partner who
is C. trachomatis positive.

Test of cure

• Not routinely recommended.
• It should be performed in pregnancy or if non-compliance or re-exposure is suspected
at 5 weeks (6 weeks if azithromycin given) after treatment is completed.

CHAPTER 47 Herpes

Natural history

Background

• Majority of infections are asymptomatic (80%).
• Primary genital herpes – equally likely to be caused by HSV-1 or HSV-2.
• Following primary infection, the virus becomes latent in local sensory ganglia, periodically reactivating
to cause symptomatic lesions or asymptomatic, but infectious, viral shedding.
• Virus can be shed asymptomatically from the external genitalia, anus, rectum, cervix, and urethra.
• Recurrence rate after a symptomatic first episode is 0.34 recurrences/month for HSV-2 and is four times
more frequent than the recurrence rate for HSV-1. Recurrence rates decline over time.
• In HIV-positive HSV-2 seropositive individuals, both symptomatic and asymptomatic shedding are
increased, especially in those with low CD4 counts and those who are also seropositive for HSV-16.

• HSV-1 or HSV-2.
• Primary infection: first infection with either HSV-1 or HSV-2 in an individual with
no pre-existing antibodies.
• Recurrent episode: recurrence of clinical symptoms owing to reactivation of preexistent HSV-1 or HSV-2 infection after a period of latency.

Clinical features
Symptoms

Risks or complications

• Asymptomatic.
• Local symptoms – painful ulceration, dysuria, vaginal or urethral discharge.
• Systemic symptoms – fever and myalgia. Much more common in primary.

• Autonomic neuropathy, resulting in urinary retention.
• Autoinoculation to fingers and adjacent skin, e.g., on thighs.
• Aseptic meningitis.

Signs

• Blistering and ulceration of the external genitalia (+/– cervix/rectum).
• Tender inguinal lymphadenitis, usually bilateral.
• First episodes – lesions and lymphadenitis are usually bilateral. In recurrent
disease, it is usual for lesions to affect favoured sites. They may alternate
between sides but are usually unilateral for each episode.

Investigations
Female external genitalia
showing severe blistering

Virus detection and characterization

Serology

• HSV isolation in cell culture in swabs taken from the base of the genital lesion for
confirmation of the infection and its type. Current routine diagnostic method in the UK.
• Virus typing to differentiate between HSV-1 and HSV-2.
• Virus culture – slow, labour-intensive, and expensive. Specificity is virtually 100%, but levels
of virus shedding, quality of specimens, sample storage and transport conditions influence
sensitivity.
• HSV DNA detection by PCR increases HSV detection rates compared with virus culture. It
allows less stringent conditions for sample storage and transport than virus culture and new
real-time PCR assays are rapid and highly specific. Real-time PCR is recommended as the
preferred diagnostic method for genital herpes.

• HSV type-specific antibodies – HSV-1 or HSV-2 IgG represents HSV infection at some time.
It is difficult to say whether the infection is recent as IgM detection is unreliable. Collection
of serum samples a few weeks apart can be used to show seroconversion and, hence, recent
primary infection. HSV-2 antibodies are indicative of genital herpes. HSV-1 antibodies do not
differentiate between genital and oropharyngeal infection.
• Serology may be helpful in recurrent genital disease of unknown cause; counselling patients
with initial episodes of disease, including pregnant women; investigating asymptomatic
partners of patients with genital herpes.

Management

Counselling

First-episode genital herpes

Recurrent genital herpes

• Most people with recurrences adjust over time but
antiviral treatment can improve quality of life.
• Everyday stress does not affect recurrences.
• Use of antiviral drugs for symptom control.
• Abstinence from sexual contact during recurrences or
prodromes.
• Reassure regarding transmission by fomites and
autoinoculation after the first infection is over.
• Transmission may occur as a result of asymptomatic
viral shedding.
• Condoms may help in reducing transmission; however,
their use cannot completely prevent transmission.

• General advice – saline bathing; analgesia; topical anaesthetic agents,
e.g., 5% lignocaine ointment may be useful but use with caution
because of the risk of potential sensitization.
• Antiviral drugs reduce the severity and duration of episodes.
* Oral antiviral drugs within 5 days of the start of the episode and
while new lesions are still forming.
* Aciclovir, valaciclovir, and famciclovir.
* Antiviral therapy does not alter the natural history of the disease.
* Topical agents are less effective than oral agents.
* Combined oral and topical treatment is of no benefit.
* IV therapy only when the patient cannot swallow or tolerate oral
medication because of vomiting.
* There is no evidence for benefit from courses longer than 5 days.
• Review the patient after 5 days and continue therapy if new lesions are
still appearing at this time.
• Management of complications:
* Hospitalize if urinary retention, meningism, and severe
constitutional symptoms.
* If catheterization is required, suprapubic catheterization is preferred
to prevent theoretical risk of ascending infection, to reduce the pain
associated with the procedure, and to allow normal micturition to
be restored without multiple removals and recatheterizations.

• Recurrences are self-limiting and generally cause
minor symptoms.
• Manage according to recurrence frequency,
symptom severity, and relationship status.
• General advice – saline bathing, analgesia, 5%
lignocaine ointment.
• Episodic antiviral treatment:
* Oral aciclovir, valaciclovir, and famciclovir
reduce the duration (by 1–2 days) and
severity of recurrence.
* Patient-initiated treatment started early in an
episode is most likely to be effective.
• Suppressive antiviral therapy – patients who
have at least six recurrences per annum have
fewer or no episodes on suppressive therapy.
Patients with lower rates of recurrence will
probably also have fewer recurrences with
treatment. Balance the frequency of recurrence
with the cost and inconvenience of treatment.

Asymptomatic viral shedding

Partner notification

• Most common in patients with genital HSV-2 infection in the first year after infection. In
individuals with frequent symptomatic recurrences, it is an important cause of transmission.
May be reduced by aciclovir 400 mg twice daily.
• Prevention of transmission:
* Condoms may be partially effective.
* Aciclovir, famciclovir, and valaciclovir all suppress symptomatic and asymptomatic viral
shedding by about 80–90%.
• Suppressive antiviral therapy with valaciclovir reduces the rate of acquisition of HSV-2
infection and clinically symptomatic genital herpes in sero-discordant couples. Although
valaciclovir reduces the risk of acquiring symptomatic infection by 75%, approximately 60
people need to be treated to prevent one transmission.

• May clarify whether a partner is infected or not.
• Is an effective way of detecting individuals with unrecognized disease.
• May help to relieve anxiety about transmission or reinforce the need to reduce the risk of
transmission.
• Awareness of the diagnosis in a partner or ex-partner may prevent further onward
transmission.
• Herpes vaccines – there are no vaccines currently approved for prevention of genital herpes
although trials are ongoing.

CHAPTER 48 Lymphogranuloma venereum

Background
• Systemic disease caused by Chlamydia trachomatis. • Rare in developed countries with
65 reported cases of ‘tropical genital ulcers’ (chancroid, LGV, and donovanosis) in England
in 1998. Since 2003, there has been a series of LGV outbreaks in European cities, mostly
among HIV-positive men who have sex with men (MSM); more than 75% are HIV positive,
and many have concomitant STIs (e.g., gonorrhoea) or infection with hepatitis C virus.

Clinical features – three stages.
• Incubation period – 3–30 days.
• Primary lesion – transient, painless papule or pustule, or shallow erosion. Found on coronal
sulcus of males and on the posterior vaginal wall, fourchette, vulva, and occasionally on the
cervix of females. Extra-genital lesions – oral cavity (tonsil) and extra-genital lymph nodes.
• Secondary lesions – lymphadenitis or lymphadenopathy or Bubo. Chlamydia serovars
L1– L3 are lymphotropic, resulting in thrombolymphangitis and peri-lymphangitis resulting
in inflammation and swelling of lymph nodes and surrounding tissue. Lymphadenopathy
commonly follows the primary lesion by a period of a few days to weeks.
* Most common clinical manifestation – unilateral (2/3 of cases) tender inguinal and/or
femoral lymphadenopathy. It may involve one lymph node or the entire chain, which can
become matted with multiple points, creating chronic fistulae.
* When both inguinal and femoral lymph nodes are involved, they may be separated by the
so-called ‘groove sign’, which consists of the separation of these two lymph node systems
by the inguinal ligament which is pathognomonic of LGV (only seen in 15–20% of cases).
* Systemic spread may be associated with fever, arthritis, pneumonitis and, rarely,
peri-hepatitis (Fitz–Hugh–Curtis syndrome).
• Tertiary stage – the genitoanorectal syndrome:
* Majority recover after the secondary stage without sequelae, but in a few patients the
persistence or progressive spread of Chlamydia in anogenital tissues results in a chronic
inflammatory response, and destruction of tissue resulting in proctitis, acute proctocolitis
mimicking Crohn’s disease, fistulae, strictures, and a chronic granulomatous disfiguring
condition of the vulva (esthiomene).

Risks or complications
• Destruction of lymph nodes may result in lymphoedema of genitals (elephantiasis)
with persistent suppuration and pyoderma.
• An association with rectal cancer has been reported.

• In recent outbreaks, all cases presented with proctitis resulting in severe rectal pain,
mucoid and/or haemorrhagic rectal discharge, tenesmus, constipation and other signs of
lower gastrointestinal inflammation, which can be very intense. Some patients reported
systemic symptoms such as fever and malaise. Genital ulcers and inguinal symptoms are
rare.

Differential diagnosis

• Other causes of genital ulcerations or inguinal lymphadenopathy.
• Anorectal syndrome – exclude other causes of rectal bleeding.
• Investigations for other potentially co-existing STIs, in particular for syphilis.

Sample sites

• Chlamydiae are intracellular organisms, thus samples must contain cellular material:
* From the ulcer base exudate or from rectal tissue.
* By aspiration from fluctuant lymph nodes.
* Rectal swabs from MSM and women exposed rectally.
* A urethral swab or first-catch urine sample when lymphadenopathy is present.

SECTION 7

Sexual and reproductive health

Investigations

• Detection of NAATs with PCR for urethral, cervical, or urine specimens is highly sensitive and
specific. Confirm positive samples by real-time PCR for LGV-specific DNA.
• Culture from suspected LGV lesion is most specific, but its sensitivity is 75–85% and 30–50% in
the case of bubo aspirate. It is labour intensive, expensive, and of restricted availability.
• Chlamydia trachomatis serology – a 4-fold rise of antibody (both IgM and IgG) in the course of
suspected illness is diagnostic of active infection. Alternatively, single point titres of > 1/64 and
> 1/256 are considered positive. The test may lack sensitivity for the earlier manifestations of LGV
such as ulcers, and a high titre in the absence of symptoms cannot confirm LGV.

• Original Frei test is abandoned owing to lack of sensitivity and specificity.
• Direct immunofluorescence of material from lesions to demonstrate Chlamydia
trachomatis elementary and inclusion bodies is sensitive but requires expertise and is
labour intensive.
• Enzyme immunoassay has lower sensitivity and it is no longer recommended.
• Histology of lymph nodes showing follicular hyperplasia and abscesses is nonspecific.
• Typing to distinguish LGV strains from other chlamydial serotypes with molecular
diagnostic techniques are newer technologies becoming available.

Management

General advice

Recommended regimens

Sexual partner(s)

• To avoid UPSI until the patient and partner(s) have completed
treatment and follow-up.
• Screen for other possible causes of genital ulcerative disease –
Haemophilus ducreyi, Treponema pallidum, herpes simplex,
and Klebsiella/Calymmatobacterium granulomatis, and other
STIs.
• Biopsy of lymph nodes may be required to exclude neoplasia.

• Treat early to reduce the chronic phase.
• Prolonged treatment (at least 3 weeks) is the norm.
• Recommended regimens:
* 1st choice: doxycycline 100 mg BD orally for 21 days.
* 2nd choice: erythromycin 500 mg QDS orally for 21 days.
• Alternative regimens – azithromycin may be effective in
multiple doses over 2–3 weeks but clinical data are lacking.

• Examine persons who have had sexual contact
with a patient with LGV within the 30 days
before onset of the patient’s symptoms; test for
rectal, urethral, or cervical chlamydial infection
and treat, or provide presumptive treatment
(e.g., azithromycin 1.0 g orally or doxycycline
100 mg BD for 7 days).

• Consider surgical repair, including reconstructive genital
surgery in patients with fibrotic lesions or fistulae.

Fluctuant buboes – aspirate fluctuant buboes through healthy adjacent skin.
Surgical incision is usually contraindicated because of fear of complications.

Follow-up and test of cure (TOC)
• Follow clinically until signs and symptoms have resolved. This may occur within 3–6 weeks.
• Routine microbiological TOC depends on locally available resources. Specific NAAT tests can be used,
although their use has not been rigorously evaluated and the optimum time for testing is not yet known.

CHAPTER 49 Molluscum contagiosum

Background
• A benign viral skin infection most commonly seen in children. However, sexual contact in
adults may lead to the appearance of lesions in the genital area.
• Caused by a poxvirus. The virus is probably passed on by direct skin-to-skin contact, and
may affect any part of the body.

Complications
• Secondary bacterial infection may result if lesions are scratched.
• In the immunocompromised, e.g., in HIV infection, lesions may become large
and exuberant, and secondary infection may be problematic.
• The main differential diagnosis is with genital warts, which are neither smooth
nor umbilicated.

Clinical features
• Incubation period – 3–12 weeks.
• Discrete, pearly, papular, smooth or umbilicated lesions. In immunocompetent individuals
the size of the lesions seldom exceeds 5 mm, and if untreated, there is usually spontaneous
regression after several months.
• Facial lesions may be seen with HIV-related immunodeficiency.

Investigations
• Core of lesions can be examined by electron microscopy, under which typical poxvirus-like
particles will be seen.
• HIV testing is recommended in patients presenting with facial lesions.

Sexual and reproductive health

Management

General advice

Recommended regimens

• Spontaneous regression of lesions.
Treatment is offered for cosmetic
reasons only.
• Screening for other possible STIs.

• Aim is tissue destruction with viral demise accompanying this.
• Cryotherapy – apply liquid nitrogen until a halo of ice surrounds the
lesion. Repeat applications may be necessary.
• Expression of the pearly core, either manually or using forceps.
• Piercing with an orange stick, with or without the application of tincture
of iodine or phenol.
• Curettage or diathermy under local anaesthesia.
• Podophyllotoxin cream (0.5%) can be self-applied in men.
• Imiquimod 5% cream can be self-applied in men.
• Patients with HIV infection – HAART may lead to resolution of lesions.

• Allergy – avoid treatments to which there is known
hypersensitivity.
• Pregnant or lactating women, and children:
* Cryotherapy and other destructive methods are safe.
* Podophyllotoxin is contraindicated.
• Sexual partner – contact tracing of partners is
unnecessary.

CHAPTER 50 Chancroid

Background
•

•
•

•
•

Previously the most common cause of genital ulcers in the developing world. Genital ulcers due to

HSV-2 infection are increasing with decreasing H. ducreyi.
H. ducreyi is an important co-factor in the transmission of HIV infection.
Chancroid has been rare in developed countries. There had been 50–80 cases of ‘tropical
genital ulcers’ (chancroid, LGV, and donovanosis) in England and Wales annually between
1996 and 2002; the recent increase to 300 cases is mainly due to the recent epidemic of LGV.
Most cases are acquired abroad or with a partner who has been abroad.
Co-infections of H. ducreyi with Treponema pallidum or HSV occur in over 10% of patients.

Clinical features
• Anogenital ulceration and lymphadenitis with progression to bubo formation.
• Incubation period is 3–10 days, and the initial lesion may progress rapidly to form an open
sore. There are no prodromal symptoms.
• The ulcer: * Single or (often) multiple. * Not indurated (‘soft sore’).
* With a necrotic base and purulent exudate. * Bordered by ragged undermined edges.
* Bleeds easily on contact. * Pain: a distinctive feature, more common in men.
• Males – most ulcers are found on the prepuce near the frenulum or in the coronal sulcus.
• Females – most lesions are found at the entrance of the vagina, particularly the fourchette.
Several lesions may merge to form gigantic ulcers.
• Painful inguinal adenitis is also a characteristic feature of chancroid and may be present
in 50% of cases. The adenitis is unilateral in most patients. Buboes form and can become
fluctuant and rupture, releasing thick pus, resulting sometimes in extensive ulceration.

Risks or complications
• Mostly seen in men, these may include phimosis and partial loss of tissue, particularly on the
glans penis (so called ‘phagedenic’ ulcers).
• H. ducreyi has not been shown to cause systemic infection or to spread to distant sites.

• Differential clinical diagnosis is often unreliable with an accuracy ranging from 33% to 80%.
Two alternatives – (1) Combined: laboratory testing to rule out the presence of other genital
ulcerative disease (GUD) pathogens such as syphilis and HSV-2; (2) Use of syndromic treatment,
i.e., combined antimicrobials to cover all possible treatable aetiologies of GUD. WHO
recommends it in places where diagnostic facilities are not readily available.
• The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2007: a ‘probable diagnosis’ if the patient
has one or more painful genital ulcers, and (a) no evidence of T. pallidum infection by dark
field examination of ulcer exudate or by a serological test for syphilis performed at least 7
days after onset of ulcers, and (b) the clinical presentation, appearance of the genital ulcers,
and regional lymphadenopathy, if present, are typical for chancroid, and a test for HSV
is negative.

Investigations

• Culture of material obtained from the ulcer base, or the undermined edges of the ulcer, or
from pus aspirated from the bubo.
• Detection of DNA by amplification techniques such as PCR, using nested techniques.
• Microscopy of a Gram-stained smear (or other stains) of material from the ulcer base or of
pus aspirated from the bubo: demonstration of characteristic Gram-negative coccobacilli,
with occasional characteristic chaining. The test has low sensitivity and is not recommended
as a diagnostic test.
• Serology – detection of antibody to H. ducreyi as a marker of chancroid using enzyme-linked
immunoassays (EIAs). The method lacks sensitivity, specificity (cross-reaction with other
Haemophilus species) and cannot distinguish between remote and recent infection; therefore,
serology should not be used for management.

SECTION 7

Sexual and reproductive health

Management

General advice

Recommended regimens

Pregnant or lactating women, and children

• Avoid UPSI until patient and partner(s) have
completed treatment and follow-up.
• Further investigations to screen for other
possible causes of genital ulcerative disease
such as T. pallidum and genital herpes, LGV,
or donovanosis and HIV.
• Biopsy of lymph nodes may be required to
exclude neoplasia.

* Azithromycin 1 g orally in a single dose.
* Or ceftriaxone 250 mg IM in a single dose.
* Or ciprofloxacin 500 mg orally in a single dose.
* Or ciprofloxacin 500 mg orally BD for 3 days.
* Or erythromycin base 500 mg orally QID for 7 days.
• Azithromycin and ceftriaxone offer the advantage of single-dose therapy.
They have excellent in vitro activity against H. ducreyi with no reported
resistance to date.
• Erythromycin given at high doses for 7 days is the WHO-recommended
first line treatment for chancroid. Cure rates of 93% but associated with
poor compliance and gastrointestinal intolerance.

• Safety of azithromycin for pregnant and lactating women
has not been established.
• Ciprofloxacin is contraindicated for pregnant and
lactating women, children, and adolescents younger than
18 years of age.
• Erythromycin or ceftriaxone regimens should be used.
• No adverse effects of chancroid on pregnancy outcome or
on the fetus have been reported.

Patients co-infected with HIV

Fluctuant buboes

• Monitor closely, healing may be slower and treatment failures have been recorded with
azithromycin, ceftriaxone or single dose fleroxacin, low dose erythromycin or ciprofloxacin.
• CDC – as data on therapeutic efficacy with ceftriaxone and azithromycin regimens among
patients infected with HIV are limited, those regimens should be used among persons known
to be infected with HIV, only if follow-up can be assured.
• Some experts suggest using the full-dose erythromycin 7-day regimen for treating
HIV-infected persons.

• Needle-aspiration of fluctuant buboes from adjacent healthy skin. It is simpler and safer than
incision, which is prone to complications (sinus formation).
• Careful incision and drainage under effective antibiotic cover is also reported to be an effective
and safe method for treating fluctuant buboes, and avoids frequent needle re-aspirations.

Follow up and test of cure (TOC)
• Re-examine 3–7 days after initiation of therapy. If treatment is successful, ulcers improve symptomatically within 3 days and substantial re-epithelization occurs
within 7 days after onset of therapy. The time required for complete healing is related to the size of the ulcer; large ulcers may require more than 2 weeks to heal.
• Clinical resolution of fluctuant lymphadenopathy is slower than that of ulcers and may require frequent needle aspiration (or drainage).
• A test of cure is not recommended.
• Treatment failures – investigate possible co-infections with T. pallidum or HSV; or determine possible resistance of H. ducreyi to antibiotics.
• Sexual partner – people who have had sexual contact with a patient who has chancroid within the 10 days before onset of the patient’s symptoms should be
examined, and treated even in the absence of symptoms, as asymptomatic carriage of H. ducreyi can occur. Screening is not recommended.

CHAPTER 51 Donovanosis – granuloma inguinale

Background
• STI – usually manifests as genital ulceration.
• Seen chiefly in small endemic foci in tropical countries.
• Causative organism – Klebsiella granulomatis (Calymmatobacterium granulomatis).

Risks or complications
•
•
•
•

Haemorrhage, genital lymphoedema, genital mutilation, and cicatrization.
Development of squamous carcinoma.
Haematogenous dissemination to bone and viscera (rare).
Vertical transmission (rare) – lesions of the ears of infants.

Clinical features
• At site of primary inoculation – painful papules/nodules whcih develop into friable ulcers or
hypertrophic lesions, which gradually increase in size.
• Regional lymph nodes – swelling followed by spread of infection into overlying tissues,
resulting in abscess (pseudobubo) or ulceration of overlying skin (mainly at inguinal nodes).
• Untreated infection may either resolve spontaneously or persist and slowly spread.
• Primary lesions of mouth and cervix can occur. Cervical lesions can be mistaken for
malignant lesions.

Investigations
• Donovan bodies – demonstrated in:
* Cellular material taken by scraping/smear/swab/crushing of pinched-off tissue fragment
on to glass slide.
* Tissue sample from biopsy.
• Donovan bodies are characterized by:
* Location within large (20–90 μm) histiocytes.
* Pleomorphic appearance 1−2 × 0.5−0.7 μm.
* Bipolar densities and a capsule often visible.
* Stain Gram negative.
* Sensitivity is 60–80% in endemic areas.
• Culture of Klebsiella granulomatis has recently been reported.
• Both PCR methods and serological tests for donovanosis have been described but are not yet
routinely available.

Management

General advice

Recommended regimens

Pregnant or lactating women, and children

• To avoid UPSI until patient and partner(s) have completed
treatment and follow-up.
• Further investigations – screen for other possible causes of
genital ulcerative disease (syphilis, genital herpes, LGV),
and HIV.
• Biopsy of lymph nodes may be required to exclude
neoplasia.

• Azithromycin by the Australian Antibiotic Guidelines.
• CDC – ciprofloxacin is recommended, which has
better bioavailability than norfloxacin. Gentamicin is
recommended as an adjunct to therapy in patients whose
lesions do not respond in the first few days to other
agents.
• Duration of treatment is until lesions have healed.
Healing times vary greatly between patients. CDC
recommends a minimum of 3 weeks’ treatment.

• Gentamicin, doxycycyline, co-trimoxazole, and
norfloxacin are not recommended for pregnant or
lactating women.
• Erythromycin has been used successfully in pregnant
women.
• Children born to mothers with untreated genital lesions
of donovanosis are at risk of infection; therefore, consider
a course of prophylactic antibiotics.

Follow-up

• Follow patients until symptoms have resolved.
• Partner management – assess and offer treatment to any person with a history of UPSI with a patient with
active donovanosis or within 40 days before the onset of lesions (incubation period of between 3 and 40
days in 92% of patients).

CHAPTER 52 Phthirus pubis

Background
• The crab louse Phthirus pubis is transmitted by close body contact.
• Incubation period is 5 days to several weeks.
• Occasionally individuals may have more prolonged, asymptomatic infestation.

Clinical features
•
•
•
•
•
•

Adult lice infest coarse hairs of the pubic area, body hair, and, rarely, eyebrows and eyelashes.
Eggs (nits) are laid, which adhere to the hairs.
May be asymptomatic.
Itching due to hypersensitivity to feeding lice.
Blue macules (maculae caeruleae) may be visible at feeding sites.
On examination – may see adult lice and/or eggs.

Investigations
• Examination under light microscopy can confirm the morphology if necessary.

Management

General advice

Recommended regimens

• To avoid UPSI until the patient and partner(s) have
completed treatment and follow-up.
• Screen for other possible STIs.
• Lotions are more effective than shampoos, and
should be applied to all body hair including the
beard and moustache if necessary. Advise a second
application after 3–7 days.

• Malathion 0.5% – apply to dry hair and wash after at least 2 and,
preferably, 12 hours, i.e., overnight.
• Permethrin 1% cream – apply to damp hair and wash after 10 minutes.
• Phenothrin 0.2% – apply to dry hair and wash after 2 hours.
• Carbaryl 0.5 and 1% – apply to dry hair and wash 12 hours later.
• Infestation of eyelashes – permethrin 1% lotion for 10 minutes.

• Allergy – avoid treatments to which there is known
hypersensitivity.
• Pregnant or lactating women, and children –
permethrin is safe during pregnancy and breastfeeding.
• Sexual partner – examine and treat current sexual
partners. * Contact trace of partners from the
previous 3 months.

Follow-up and test of cure
• Re-examine for absence of lice after 1 week.
• Provide an alternative from the above list for treatment failures.
• Dead nits may remain adherent to hairs and this does not imply treatment failure.

CHAPTER 53 Scabies

Complications

Background
• Caused by the mite Sarcoptes scabiei. • Mites burrow into the skin where they lay eggs. The resulting
offspring crawl out onto the skin and make new burrows.
• The absorption of mite excrement into skin capillaries generates a hypersensitivity reaction.
• Any part of the body may be affected, and transmission is by skin-to-skin contact.

• Secondary infection of the skin lesions can occur following repeated scratching.
• The clinical appearance is usually typical, but there may be diagnostic confusion
with other itching conditions such as eczema.

Clinical features
• Symptoms – generalized itch, especially at night. May take 4–6 weeks to develop.
• Signs: * Characteristic silvery lines may be seen in the skin, where mites have burrowed.
* Classic sites – interdigital folds, wrists and elbows, and around breast nipples.
* Papules or nodules that may result from itching often affect the genital area.
* Norwegian scabies is seen in HIV infection; crusted lesions that teem with mites.

Investigations
• Scrapings taken from burrows may be examined under light microscopy to reveal mites.

Management
General advice

Recommended regimens

• To avoid close body contact until the patient and partner(s)
have completed treatment.
• Screen for other possible STIs.
• Crotamiton cream and antihistamines may give
symptomatic relief.
• To wash contaminated clothes and bedding at high
temperature (> 50°C) if possible.

• Permethrin 5% cream.
• Malathion 0.5% aqueous lotion. Apply to the whole
body from the neck downwards, and wash off after
12 hours, usually overnight.
• Norwegian scabies may be treated with oral
ivermectin (200 μg/kg).

• Allergy – avoid treatments to which there is known
hypersensitivity.
• Pregnant or lactating women, and children – permethrin is
safe.
• Sexual partner – examine and treat current sexual partners
as well as other members of the household.
* Trace contacts with an arbitrary time span of the
previous 2 months.

Follow-up
• There is no clear evidence as to optimal follow-up.
• Appearance of new burrows at any stage post-treatment is indicative of a need for further therapy, although in
re-infection, symptoms of pruritus may recur before typical burrows have developed.
• Pruritus persisting > 2 weeks after treatment may reflect treatment failure, re-infection, or drug allergy.

Sexual and reproductive health

CHAPTER 54 Syphilis

Background
• Spirochaete – Treponema pallidum.
• Transmitted by direct contact with an infectious lesion (usually occurring during sexual
contact), vertical transmission (may be passed trans-placentally from the 9th week of
gestation onwards) or via infected blood products.
• In England, diagnoses of syphilis have increased substantially since 1997; 3762 cases were
diagnosed in 2007.
• Epidemics of syphilis and LGV are continuing, especially among men who have sex with men
(MSM) who are known to be HIV infected.
• MSM account for 73% of infectious syphilis and 99% of LGV cases.
• HIV co-infection is common in those diagnosed with LGV (74%) and syphilis (27%),
reflecting the close relationships between the epidemics. (HPA, 2009)
• The increased number of syphilis cases in women of reproductive age has resulted in an
increase in cases of congenital infection.

Congenital syphilis

• Early – diagnosed in the first two years of life; includes a rash, condylomata lata,
vesiculobullous lesions, haemorrhagic rhinitis, osteochondritis, periostitis, pseudoparalysis,
mucous patches, perioral fissures, hepatosplenomegaly, generalized lymphadenopathy, nonimmune hydrops, glomerulonephritis, neurological or ocular involvement, haemolysis, and
thrombocytopenia.
• Late – presenting after two years; includes stigmata: interstitial keratitis, Clutton’s joints,
Hutchinson’s incisors, mulberry molars, high palatal arch, rhagades, deafness, frontal
bossing, short maxilla, protuberance of mandible, saddle-nose deformity, sternoclavicular
thickening, paroxysmal cold haemoglobinuria, neurological or gummatous involvement.

Recommended sites for testing

Clinical features
• Incubation period of 9–90 days.
• Primary syphilis – ulcer (the chancre) at the site of inoculation and regional
lymphadenopathy. The chancre is classically in the anogenital region; single, painless and
indurated, with a clean base discharging clear serum. However, it may be multiple, painful,
purulent, destructive and on extra-genital (most frequently oral) sites.
• Secondary syphilis – incubation period of 6 weeks to 6 months; multisystem involvement
within the first two years of infection. Rash (typically generalized macular, papular, or
macular– papular, often affecting the palms and soles), condylomata lata, mucocutaneous
lesions, generalized lymphadenopathy. Less commonly: patchy alopecia, anterior uveitis,
meningitis, cranial nerve palsies, hepatitis, splenomegaly, periostitis, and glomerulonephritis.
• Latent syphilis – diagnosed on serological testing with no symptoms or signs. Early
latent syphilis within the first 2 years of infection and late latent syphilis after 2 years
of infection.
• Tertiary syphilis – used synonymously with late symptomatic syphilis; may develop
in approximately one third of individuals. It is non-infectious; gummatous syphilis,
neurosyphilis, and cardiovascular syphilis.

• Blood (all patients).
• Ulcer material (primary syphilis).
• Lesion material (secondary syphilis).

Risk groups

Screening is recommended for all asymptomatic patients attending a UK GUM
­clinic. Apart from the public health benefit of detecting infectious syphilis, it will
detect non-infectious stages of syphilis, which will benefit the individual patient.

• MSM. • Sex workers. • ‘Young’ (under 25 years old) patients.
• Pregnant women.
• Patients who are known contacts of the infection need a request for an
anti-treponemal IgM EIA on the blood specimen submitted for standard
screening.

Investigations

Virus detection and serological tests

Serological screening tests

• Dark-field microscopy should be performed by experienced technicians. If the initial test is negative, repeat daily for
3 days. Less reliable in examining rectal and non-penile genital lesions and not suitable for examining oral lesions due
to commensal treponemes.
• PCR may be used on oral or other lesions where contamination with commensal treponemes is likely. Owing to limited
availability and the time taken to obtain a result, this is not a replacement for dark-field microscopy in the clinic setting.
PCR may be helpful in diagnosis by demonstrating T. pallidum in tissue samples, vitreous fluid, and CSF.
• Serological test – specific (treponemal) tests:
* Treponemal enzyme immunoassay (EIA) to detect IgG and IgM; T. pallidum chemiluminescent assay; T. pallidum
haemagglutination assay (TPHA); T. pallidum particle agglutination assay (TPPA); fluorescent treponemal antibody
absorbed test (FTA-abs); T. pallidum recombinant antigen line immunoassay.
* EIA for anti-treponemal IgM if primary syphilis is suspected (tend to be more sensitive in primary infection). IgM
becomes detectable in the serum 2–3 weeks after infection, therefore there will be a window of 1–2 weeks when
routine screening tests may be negative.
* All the specific tests are almost invariably positive in secondary and early latent syphilis.
* T. pallidum particle assay (TPPA) is recommended in preference to the T. pallidum haemagglutination
assay (TPHA).
• Serological test – nonspecific cardiolipin tests: VDRL carbon antigen test/RPR. A quantitative VDRL/RPR should be
performed when treponemal; tests indicate syphilis as this helps stage the disease and indicates the need for treatment.
A VDRL/RPR titre of > 16 and/or a positive IgM test indicates active disease and the need for treatment. A falsenegative cardiolipin (reagin) test may occur in secondary or early latent syphilis. This may be more likely to occur in
HIV-infected individuals.

• Treponemal EIA (both IgG and IgM) or TPPA or VDRL/RPR and TPHA.
• Screening with either EIA alone or the TPPA alone is recommended.
• The TPHA can be used in combination with a cardiolipin antigen/
reagin test such as VDRL or RPR to maximize the detection of primary
infection on screening.
Additional and confirmatory serological tests

• Always repeat positive tests on a second specimen to confirm the result.
• Confirm a positive screening test with a different treponemal test.
• An immunoblot (T. pallidum recombinant antigen line immunoassay)
is recommended when the standard confirmatory test does not confirm
the positive treponemal screening test result. The FTA-abs is not
recommended as a standard confirmatory test.
• A quantitative VDRL/RPR should be performed on a specimen taken
on the day that treatment is started as this provides an accurate baseline
for monitoring response to treatment.
• An EIA IgM test should be performed in addition to routine screening
tests in all cases of genital ulceration as well as in those patients who
are known contacts of syphilis.
• In patients who have previously been treated for syphilis a 4-fold increase in
VDRL/RPR titre and/or a change in the EIA IgM from negative to positive
(confirmed on a second specimen) suggests re-infection or relapse.

Management

General advice

• Offer screening for other STIs.
• Advise to refrain from sexual contact of
any kind until the lesions of early syphilis
(if they were present) are fully healed, or
until after the results of the first follow-up
serology are known.

243

• Penicillin is the treatment of choice. Clinical data are lacking on the optimal dose
and duration of treatment and the long-term efficacy of antimicrobials other
than penicillin.
• Parenteral treatment is the treatment of choice because therapy is supervised and
bioavailability is guaranteed.
• 60% of untreated individuals do not develop late complications. The prevalence
of late syphilis including neurosyphilis remains low, indicating that treatment
is effective and suggests that host immune responses in early syphilis play an
essential part.
• Cardiovascular lesions may progress despite adequate treatment. Steroids are
recommended to prevent potential consequences of Jarisch–Herxheimer reaction.
• Neurosyphilis – procaine penicillin plus probenecid for 14 days. (CDC, 2006)

Non-penicillin antibiotics

• Erythromycin is least effective and does not penetrate the
CSF or placental barrier well.
• Doxycycline 100 mg OD/BD for 14 days is effective;
failure of OD dose has been reported.
• Single dose of 2 g of azithromycin has shown efficacy in
early syphilis equivalent to that of benzathine penicillin;
however, there are concerns regarding treatment failure.
• In small studies, a number of ceftriaxone regimens have
been shown to be effective.

SECTION 7

Sexual and reproductive health

Syphilis in pregnancy
• Syphilis may be transmitted trans-placentally at any stage of pregnancy.
• May result in polyhydramnios, miscarriage, PTL, stillbirth, hydrops, and congenital syphilis.
• Maternal early stage syphilis and high titre RPR/VDRL are risk factors for congenital
syphilis, although transmission rate in late latent disease could be up to 10%.
• Maternal co-infection with HIV may increase the transmission risk of syphilis.
• Treatment in the last trimester is also associated with poorer outcomes.

All pregnant women should be screened
for syphilis at the initial antenatal visit.

• In pregnancy the rate of the Jarisch–Herxheimer reaction is the same as in the non-pregnant
(40%).
• Woman may experience uterine contractions (40–65%) secondary to the fever, which resolve
within 24 hours. FHR decelerations occur in 40%, concomitant with maternal fever, and
resolve within 24 hours of maternal penicillin treatment.
• There is a theoretical increased risk of spontaneous and iatrogenic PTD and fetal demise
associated with the Jarisch–Herxheimer reaction, though these complications are also
associated with maternal and fetal syphilis infection.
• Management of the Jarisch–Herxheimer reaction in pregnancy is supportive with
antipyretics. No evidence that high-dose oral prednisolone will reduce the occurrence of
uterine contractions or FHR abnormalities.

Management

• MDT – obstetric, midwifery, paediatric, GUM
physician teams.
• Referral to FMU for USS to evaluate fetal involvement
showing non-immune hydrops or hepatospenomegaly.
• Fetal monitoring for fetal distress in the early stages of
therapy is recommended after 26 weeks of gestation.

• A single dose of benzathine penicillin G 2.4 MU is
effective in most cases, although failures have been
reported; mainly in those at increased risk of transmission
(higher RPR/VDRL titre, early stage maternal disease, and
last trimester treatment).
• Physiological changes in pregnancy may result in reduced
penicillin concentrations. Therefore, when maternal
treatment is initiated in the third trimester, give a second
dose of benzathine penicillin one week after the first. Assess
the neonate carefully and consider treatment at birth.

• Consider re-treatment in those with a previous diagnosis of
syphilis when:
* There is uncertainty of efficacious past treatment.
* A 4-fold drop in RPR/VDRL titre has not been achieved.
* The RPR/VDRL titre is serofast at > 1:8.

• Non-penicillin alternatives are ceftriaxone (limited data),
erythromycin, or azithromycin.
• There are no studies evaluating azithromycin in
pregnancy and treatment failure has been reported with
erythromycin and azithromycin. Treatment of the baby at
birth with penicillin is recommended, following maternal
treatment with macrolides.

http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/CBO9781316156513.055

Infants born to mothers with syphilis
Serological screening tests on infant’s blood (not cord blood) and
examination for signs of congenital syphilis.

If negative and no signs of congenital infection, no further testing is
necessary.

If positive – perform treponemal IgM EIA, quantitative VDRL/RPR,
and quantitative TPPA tests on the infant and mother in parallel.

A positive IgM EIA test and/or a sustained 4-fold or greater d
­ ifference
of VDRL/RPR titre or TPPA titre above that of the mother (confirmed
on testing a second specimen from the infant) confirms diagnosis of
congenital infection.

If IgM is negative, the other tests are reactive with titres < 4-fold
higher than those of the mother, and there are no signs of congenital
syphilis.

• Screen older siblings for congenital syphilis.
• Manage congenital syphilis diagnosed in an older
child or in adulthood as for late syphilis but screen
the parents, all siblings, and any sexual partner(s) for
syphilis.

• Repeat reactive tests at 3, 6, and
12 months of age or until all tests
become negative (usually by 6
months).
• Repeat IgM at 3 months in case
the infant’s response is delayed or
suppressed.

Management

Treatment for congenital syphilis is indicated in:
• Infants with suspected congenital syphilis.
• Mothers
* Treated < 4 weeks prior to delivery.
* Treated with non-penicillin regimens.
* Who were not treated.
* Who were inadequately treated.
* Who have no documentation of being treated.
Regimens:
• Benzyl penicillin sodium 100,000–150,000 units/kg daily IV (in divided
doses) in the first 7 days of life and 8 hourly thereafter for 10 days.
• Procaine penicillin 50,000 units/kg daily IM for 10 days.
• In children, IV may be preferable due to the pain associated with
IM injections.
245

Monitor:
• Infants born to mothers treated for syphilis prior to pregnancy.
• Infants born to mothers treated with a penicillin-based regimen more
than 4 weeks prior to delivery with no evidence of re-infection or
relapse. CDC – a stat dose of benzathine penicillin G 50,000 units/kg.
• Treatment may be indicated particularly if follow-up is uncertain or if
treatment was in the last trimester of pregnancy.

CHAPTER 55 Anogenital warts (condylomata acuminata)

Background
• Caused by the human papilloma virus (HPV), usually by HPV types 6 and 11.
• Over 100 genotypes have been identified.
• Most anogenital warts are benign proliferative growths; some may contain oncogenic
types associated with genital tract dysplasia and cancers.
• Mode of transmission is mainly by sexual contact, but may be transmitted peri-natally.
Genital lesions result from transfer of infection from hand warts in children.
• There is no good evidence of transmission from fomites.
• Incidence of new anogenital warts in the UK is about 100,000 cases/year.
• 55% of anogenital wart diagnoses were in those aged less than 25 years old.

Clinical features
Symptoms:

•
•
•
•
•

Asymptomatic – majority cause little physical discomfort.
May be associated with irritation and soreness, especially around the anus.
May present with inflammation, fissuring, itching, bleeding, or dyspareunia.
Vaginal discharge, IMB, PCB.
Urinary symptoms – distortion of urine flow, bleeding from the urethra, urethral
discharge, dysuria.
• Bleeding from anus.
Signs – benign epithelial skin tumours with clinical appearances of exophytic warts:
* Single or multiple.
* Warts on the warm, moist, non-hair-bearing skin are soft and non-keratinized; those
on the dry hairy skin are firm and keratinized.
* May be broad based or pedunculated or pigmented.

Site of the lesions
• Multifocal infection of the anogenital skin, most common at the site of trauma at sexual
intercourse, but may occur at any site.
• Perianal lesions are common in both sexes, but are seen more commonly in homosexual
men.
• Warts in the anal canal are associated with penetrative anal sex, and may indicate the
need for samples to be taken from the anorectal region for other STIs.
• Occult lesions may be seen on the vagina, cervix, urethral meatus, and anal canal.
• Extra-genital lesions may be seen in the oral cavity, larynx, conjunctivae, and nasal cavity.

Risks or complications
• May be disfiguring, leading to psychological distress.
• Up to 20% of people with anogenital warts will also have another STI.

Differential diagnosis
• Molluscum contagiosum, skin tags, seborrhoeic keratoses.
• Secondary syphilis, which may present as anogenital condylomata lata (moist warty
lesions at sites of skin friction such as perianal and vulval areas).
• Other STIs.
• Vulval, penile, or anal intra-epithelial neoplasia if the lesions are flat, only slightly raised,
or pigmented.
• Malignancy if the lesions are ulcerated or bleeding.

Assessment of lesions:

• Examine external anogenital and surrounding skin under good illumination.
• Females – vaginal speculum examination.
• Both sexes – proctoscopy may be indicated if history of anal receptive sex, or following
clearance of perianal warts. Meatoscopy and proctoscopy if there is a history of distortion
of urine flow or bleeding from the urethra or anus, respectively. Urethroscopy for more
proximal warts.
• Classify warts as to morphology. Record lesions on genital maps at each visit; provides a
visual record of approximate number, distribution, and response to treatment.
• Examine extra-genital sites (e.g., oral cavity) if clinically indicated.

Investigations
• Biopsy to rule out possible intra-epithelial neoplasia if in doubt, or if the lesion is atypical
or pigmented (with or without a colposcope).

SECTION 7

Sexual and reproductive health

Management

Subclinical lesions

General advice

Treatment options

• Lesions not seen by the naked eye but detectable
after applying 5% acetic acid (aceto-white lesions)
and examining under colposcopic magnification.
• Usually asymptomatic, but may cause irritation
and inflammation of the skin.
• Issues:
* Many aceto-white lesions are not caused by
HPV.
* Histological changes are not specific for HPV
infection.
* HPV detection is not routinely available.
* Treatment of these lesions has not been shown
to affect the course of disease.
* Identification may cause unnecessary anxiety.
• It is not recommended that these lesions are sought
unless there is a clinical indication.

• Condoms may protect against the HPV infection
and genital warts, and may have a therapeutic
effect when both partners are infected, possibly
by preventing continued re-exposure to the virus.
• Latex condoms may be weakened if in contact
with imiquimod.
• Psychological distress – refer for counselling.
• Smokers may not respond as well to treatment as
non-smokers.
• Screen for other STIs.

• No treatment – as one third of warts disappear spontaneously
within 6 months.
• Chemical applications – podophyllin, podophyllotoxin,
trichloroacetic acid, 5-fluorouracil, interferons, imiquimod.
• Physical ablation – excision, cryotherapy, electrosurgery, laser.
• Imiquimod – an immune response modifier.
• Choice depends on the morphology, number, distribution of warts,
and patient preference.
• All have significant failure and relapse rates; may cause discomfort
and local skin reactions.
• Soft non-keratinized warts – podophyllin, podophyllotoxin, and
trichloroatic acid.
• Keratinized lesions – cryotherapy, excision, or electrocautery.
• Imiquimod – for both keratinized and non-keratinized warts.
• Podophyllotoxin, for 4 week cycles, and imiquimod for up to 16
weeks can be used for home treatment by patients.

Sexual partners

Pregnancy

• Assess current sexual partner(s) for any undetected genital warts and other STIs.
• Tracing of previous sexual partner(s) is not recommended.

• Children may develop laryngeal papillomatosis and anogenital warts.
• Treatment aims to minimize the number of lesions present at delivery to reduce
the neonatal exposure to the virus.
• Avoid podophyllin, podophyllotoxin, and 5-fluorouracil due to possible
teratogenic effects; imiquimod is not approved for use in pregnancy.
• CS may be indicated due to the obstruction of vaginal outlet with warts or
the presence of gross cervical warts. CS is not indicated to prevent laryngeal
papillomatosis/anogenital warts in the neonate as both conditions are rare.

Follow-up
• Review at end of course to monitor response. Patients who respond well to treatment, but in
whom new lesions develop, can continue with current regimen.
• Change of treatment is necessary if patient is not tolerating current treatment or there is < 50%
response to current treatment by 6 weeks (8–12 weeks for imiquimod).
• Treat relapses according to the lesion types.

Consider the possibility of sexual abuse in any child with anogenital warts, particularly if younger than 13 years of age.

Male and female condoms

Correct use and caution – advice

• Counsel regarding correct use of condoms, appropriate use of lubricant, STI screening, and
when EC may be required.
• To use polyurethane condoms or deproteinized latex condoms in case of latex sensitivity.
• If symptoms of local genital irritation associated with latex condom, take a clinical history
to identify any cause. Consider further investigation and referral if necessary.
• Not to use condoms lubricated with spermicide.
• To use non-oil-based preparation if using lubricant with latex condoms.
• To use lubricant for anal sex to reduce the risk of condom breakage.
• Do not apply lubricant to the penis under a male condom as this is associated with slippage.
• Use of a thicker condom instead of standard condoms does not reduce the risk of breakage.

Prevention of STIs

• Use of condoms reduces the risk of STIs. However, even with consistent and
correct use, transmission may still occur.
• Consistent and correct use of:
* Condoms reduces the risk of C. trachomatis, N. gonorrhoeae, T. vaginalis,
syphilis, HSV, and genital HPV transmission.
* Female condoms and non-latex male condoms may reduce the risk of HIV,
HSV, syphilis, and genital HPV transmission.
• Male latex condoms may reduce the risk of transmission of hepatitis B. There
is insufficient evidence to determine the efficacy of condoms in preventing
transmission of hepatitis A and C.
• If condom failure – screen for STIs 2 weeks and 12 weeks later.

Effectiveness

• When used consistently and correctly:
* Male condoms are up to 98% effective at preventing pregnancy.
* Female condoms are up to 95% effective at preventing pregnancy.
• Pregnancy rates are similar for latex and non-latex condoms.

Condom failure

• Offer advance provision of POEC (progestogen-only emergency contraception) to women relying solely on
condoms for contraception.
• Discuss post-exposure prophylaxis for HIV following sexual exposure (PEPSE) with condom failure.

SECTION 8

Contraception

Female barrier methods
Female condoms: diaphragm, cervical caps, and contraceptive sponge

Assessment

Correct use and caution

• Take detailed history (including medical and sexual history). • Assess STI risk.
• Counsel about correct use of the method. Make sure woman can insert the diaphragm
or cervical cap correctly to cover the cervix; method used is of correct size; woman is
comfortable for the duration of its use, including during intercourse; and she can tolerate the
use of spermicide.
• Offer vaginal examination at initial fitting to ensure the safe and effective use.
• Follow and review if she experiences any problems with the method and if she has lost or
gained over 3 kg (7lb) in weight.

• Diaphragm and cervical cap:
* Use with spermicide.
* Must be left in place for at least 6 hours after the last episode of intercourse.
* Can be inserted with spermicide any time before intercourse but additional spermicide
should be applied if sex is to take place and the method has been in situ for ≥ 3 hours or
if sex is repeated with the method in place.
* Do not leave contraceptive sponge in situ longer than recommended by the manufacturer.
• Sensitivity to latex proteins – use a silicone diaphragm/cervical cap or a polyurethane female
condom.
• Check the diaphragm or cervical cap regularly for tears, holes, or cracks.
• Oil-based products can damage latex; therefore, avoid their use with latex diaphragms or
cervical caps.
• There is no evidence that inserting the diaphragm dome up or dome down influences efficacy;
however, woman should check that the diaphragm covers the cervix after insertion.
• Latex diaphragms and cervical caps can remain in place for a maximum of 30 hours.

Effectiveness
• When used consistently and correctly, effectiveness at preventing pregnancy:
* Diaphragm and cervical cap (used with spermicide) – 92–96%.
* Female condoms – 95%.
* Contraceptive sponge – 80–90%.

Emergency contraception
• Consider advance provision of POEC to women who use a diaphragm or cervical cap.
• Advice regarding EC (if a diaphragm or cervical cap is dislodged during sex or removed
within 6 hours of sex).

STIs
• Female condoms reduce the risk of STIs including HIV. However, even with consistent and
correct use, transmission may occur and male condoms provide better protection.
• There is little evidence to support the use of a diaphragm or cervical cap (with spermicide) or
a contraceptive sponge to reduce the risk of STIs.
• There is limited evidence that a diaphragm may reduce the risk of CIN.

(UKMEC 3) for use of female barrier methods
Conditions where the risks associated with use of contraceptive methods may outweigh the
benefits (UKMEC 3)

• Condition

* History of toxic shock syndrome UKMEC 3 		
UKMEC 1
* Sensitivity to latex proteins
UKMEC 3 		
UKMEC 3*
• Evidence of repeated high-dose use of the spermicide nonoxynol-9 is associated with
increased risk of genital lesions, which may increase the risk of HIV. The use of a diaphragm,
cervical cap, or contraceptive sponge (all with nonoxynol-9) by women who have HIV or
AIDS, or who are at high risk of HIV infection, is not recommended.
• Owing to a possible association between diaphragm use and non-menstrual toxic shock
syndrome, for women with a history of toxic shock syndrome the use of a diaphragm,
cervical cap, or contraceptive sponge is not recommended; they may use a female condom.
* UKMEC 3 category is given but this refers to all condoms, which includes latex male
condoms. For female polyurethane condoms, the benefits would outweigh the risks.

Combined hormonal contraception

Non-contraceptive health benefits
Background
• CHCs contain oestrogen and progestogen:
* Combined oral contraceptive pill (COC).
* Combined transdermal patch (CTP).
* Combined vaginal ring (CVR) – it is a flexible ring about 2 inches in diameter that is
inserted into the vagina. It stays in the vagina for 3 weeks and is removed for 1 week, to
allow menstruation.
• CHCs contain synthetic oestrogen (EE or mestranol), except Qlaira, which contains
oestradiol valerate.
• Efficacy of all CHCs is generally similar.
• Use of extended or continuous regimens of CHC is off licence.

Assessment
• Take detailed history and recheck the history at least annually.
• History should include medical conditions such as migraine, drug use, family history, and
lifestyle factors such as smoking.
• Record BP and BMI.
• Advice about expected bleeding patterns both initially and in the longer term.

Starting the pill
• Can start the pill at any time in the menstrual cycle if sure that the woman is not pregnant.
• If the pill is started on the first day or up to and including the 5th day of the period, woman
will be protected from pregnancy immediately.
• If pill is started at any other time in the menstrual cycle, advise additional contraception such
as condoms, for the first 7 days of pill taking.

CHC may help to improve acne.
Can provide cycle regularity, improve primary dysmenorrhoea, and reduce HMB.
May improve some of the symptoms associated with menopause.
There is a reduction in the incidence of ovarian cysts and benign ovarian tumours.
Benign breast disease – there may be a reduction in the incidence of benign breast disease
(fibroadenoma and chronic cystic disease).
Ovarian and endometrial cancer – CHC is protective against ovarian and endometrial cancer
that continues for 15 years or more after stopping CHC.
Colorectal cancer – there may be a reduction in the risk of colorectal cancer.
CHC may be associated with mood changes but there is no evidence that it causes depression.
Current evidence does not support a causal association between CHC and weight gain.

Drug interactions
• Lamotrigine (except in combination with sodium valproate) – owing to the risk of reduced
seizure control while on CHC, and the potential for toxicity in the CHC-free week, the risks
of using CHC may outweigh the benefits.
• Additional contraceptive precautions are not required when antibiotics that do not induce
enzymes are used in conjunction with CHCs.
• Additional contraceptive precautions are required with drugs that are liver enzyme inducers.
• Women who do not wish to change from a CHC while on short-term treatment with an
enzyme-inducing drug (and for 28 days after stopping treatment) may continue using a COC
containing at least 30 μg EE, the patch, or ring along with additional contraception. An
extended or tricycling regimen should be used and the hormone free interval (HFI) shortened
to 4 days. Additional contraception should be continued for 28 days after stopping the
enzyme-inducing drug.
• With the exception of the very potent enzyme inducers rifampicin and rifabutin, women
who are taking an enzyme-inducing drug and who do not wish to change from COC or use
additional precautions may increase the dose of COC to at least 50 μg EE (maximum 70 μg EE)
and use an extended or tricycling regimen with an HFI of 4 days.

SECTION 8

Contraception

Risks and side effects with CHC

Risk of VTE

MI and stroke

• Compared to non-users, the risk of VTE with use of CHC is approximately double but the
absolute risk is still very low.
• There is continuing debate about the effects of the type of progestogen in CHCs on VTE risk,
specifically whether CHCs containing desogestrel, gestodene, and cyproterone are associated
with a higher risk than CHCs containing LNG and NET.
• Reducing the dose of oestrogen from 30 to 20 μg may reduce the risk of VTE.
• There is conflicting evidence in relation to COCs containing drospirenone.
• Transdermal patch has a similar or slightly increased risk compared with COCs.
• The RR of VTE with the CVR is unknown.
• A personal history of VTE or a known thrombogenic mutation is an unacceptable health risk
for CHC use.
• For women with a family history of VTE, a negative thrombophilia screen does not
necessarily exclude all thrombogenic mutations.
• A thrombophilia screen is not recommended routinely before prescribing CHC.

• There may be a very small increased risk of ischaemic stroke, which may be influenced by
smoking, HT, and migraine with aura.
Smoking – as both smoking and age are independent risk factors, greater restrictions are placed
on the use of CHC depending on the number of cigarettes smoked and age. After smoking cessation, risk of MI associated with smoking reduces with time (see Chapter 57).
• CHC in women aged ≥ 35 years who smoke is not recommended.
HT – hypertensive individuals who use CHC are at higher risk of stroke and acute MI.The risks
of using CHC in women with consistently elevated BP outweigh the advantages. SBP ≥ 160
mmHg or DBP ≥ 95 mmHg is an unacceptable health risk. Even for women with adequately
controlled HT, alternative methods are preferable to CHC. (UKMEC 3)
Migraine – risk of stroke is increased in CHC users with migraine compared to CHC users
without migraine. The risk of stroke associated with migraine appears to affect only those with
migraine with aura, and CHC use further increases the risk of ischaemic stroke. CHC methods
represent an unacceptable health risk in presence of migraine with aura. (UKMEC 4)

Breast cancer

• Risk of breast cancer increases with age. There is no clear evidence as to the risk of breast cancer with use
of CHC. Any risk of breast cancer associated with CHC use is likely to be small, and will reduce with time
after stopping.
• Early case–control studies and meta-analysis showed an increased risk of pre-menopausal breast cancer
while using COCs. However, other well-conducted observational studies have found no increased risk or a
very small increased incidence of breast cancer.
• Any increased risk associated with use decreases with time after stopping, reducing to no significant risk
10 years after cessation.
• Women with current breast cancer – CHC methods are an unacceptable health risk. (UKMEC 4)
• A family history of breast cancer – No increased risk of breast cancer with use of CHC methods. (UKMEC 1)
• Women who are carriers of BRCA1 or BRCA2 – Evidence is mixed. The theoretical or proven risks of using
CHC generally outweigh the benefits. Expert clinical judgement and/or referral to a specialist contraceptive
provider is advised, as use of the method is not usually recommended unless other more appropriate
methods are not available or not acceptable. (UKMEC 3)

• Cervical cancer – CHC use may be associated with a small increase in the
risk of cervical cancer that is related to duration of use. CHC use does not
appear to have a negative effect on overall mortality. Reassure that the
benefits generally outweigh the risks. The risk of invasive cancer has been
shown to decline after use ceases and, by 10 years or more, return to that
of never users.
Others:

• Risk of using CHC in women with a BMI ≥ 35kg/m2 usually outweighs
the benefits.
• Advise about reducing periods of immobility during flights of > 3 hours.
• Women trekking to altitudes of > 4500 m for periods of >1 week may be
advised to consider switching to an alternative method.

Progestogen-only contraception – health benefits and risks associated with POC

Progestogen-only pills (POP)
Progestogen-only injectable contraception (POIC)
Progestogen-only implant (POIM)
LNG-IUS

Reproductive cancers

Dysmenorrhoea and menopausal symptoms

Bone health

• Breast cancer – evidence on association between breast
cancer and POCs is inconclusive.
• Cervical cancer – a small increase in the risk of
cervical cancer associated with long duration of POCs
injectable contraceptives (> 5 years) has been reported,
but the risk is smaller than that for CHC methods and
the finding is based on very few women.

• Idiopathic dysmenorrhoea and ovulatory
pain may be alleviated by POCs that inhibit
ovulation such as the desogestrel POP, POIM,
and POICs.
• LNG-IUS and DMPA may have beneficial
effects on endometriosis.
• DMPA may help to alleviate vasomotor
symptoms.

• The POIC DMPA is associated with a small loss of BMD, which usually
recovers after discontinuation.
• Women aged > 40 years – there is some reassuring evidence from small
studies to support their use in women approaching the menopause.
• Women aged > 45 years – use of DMPA is UKMEC Category 2.
• DMPA can be used until maximum recommended age of 50 years,
provided a re-evaluation of the risks and benefits of treatment for all
women is carried out every 2 years.
• For women with significant lifestyle and/or medical risk factors for
osteoporosis, consider other methods of contraception.
• There is currently no evidence of a clinically significant effect of other
POCs on BMD.

Cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease

• Although the data are limited, POC does not appear to increase the risk of stroke or MI, and
there is little or no increase in VTE risk.
• Because of the adverse effect of progestogens on lipid metabolism, there is a theoretical
risk of vascular disease in women with additional risk factors. DMPA has a greater effect
on lipid metabolism than other POCs, hence the more restrictive categories in UKMEC
(see Chapter 57). Be cautious when prescribing DMPA to women with cardiovascular risk
factors because of the effects of progestogens on lipids.

SECTION 8

Contraception

Progestogen-only pills
Bleeding pattern
Background
• Traditional POPs work by altering cervical mucus to prevent sperm penetration and by
inhibiting ovulation in some women.
• Primary mode of action of the desogestrel-only pill is inhibition of ovulation.
• No data to suggest that some POPs are better at preventing pregnancy than others.
• No delay in return of fertility following discontinuation of a POP.
• If used consistently and correctly, all POPs are > 99% effective.

Assessment
• Take history to identify conditions given a UKMEC Category 3 or 4.
• BP and an assessment of BMI.

• Changes in bleeding pattern are common: 2 in 10 women have no bleeding, 4 in 10
women have regular bleeding, and 4 in 10 women have irregular bleeding.
• Women who have a change in bleeding pattern when using a POP – assess and
consider for risk of STIs, pregnancy, or gynaecological pathology.
• No evidence that changing the type and dose of progestogen will improve bleeding
but this may help some individuals. If, after exclusion of other causes, bleeding
patterns are still unacceptable, consider an alternative contraceptive method.

Drug interactions
• Liver enzyme-inducing drugs with short-term use – advise condoms in addition
to POPs and for at least 4 weeks after the liver enzyme-inducer is stopped.
• Liver enzyme-inducing drugs with long-term use – the efficacy of POPs is
reduced, therefore consider an alternative contraceptive method.

Starting the pill

• POPs can be started to provide immediate contraceptive protection:
* Up to and including day 5 of the normal menstrual cycle.
* Up to and including day 21 postpartum.
* At the time of miscarriage/termination (< 24 weeks’ gestation) or within 5 days.
* If started after this time, advise condoms or abstinence for 48 hours.
Instructions for the pill

• To take one POP at or around the same time every day, without a pill-free interval.
• The desogestrel-only pill has a 12-hour window therefore may improve compliance.
• If a traditional POP is > 3 hours late or a desogestrel-only pill is > 12 hours late, advise
women to:
* Take the late or missed pill now.
* Continue pill taking as usual (this may mean taking two pills at the same time).
* Use condoms or abstain from sex for 48 hours after the pill is taken.
• If a woman vomits within 2 hours of pill taking, advise to take another pill ASAP.

Follow-up
• Women may be given up to 12 months’ supply of POPs at their first and follow-up visits.
• POP can be continued until the age of 55 years. Alternatively check FSH levels on 2 occasions
1–2 months apart. If both FSH levels are > 30 IU/L suggestive of ovarian failure, advise
them to continue with a POP or barrier contraception for 1 further year (or 2 years if aged
< 50 years).

UK Medical Eligibility Criteria (Refer to Chapter 57)

• UKMEC 4 – current breast cancer.
• UKMEC 3:
◆	Initiation of a POP in women with: * A history of breast cancer (no evidence of disease
in the last 5 years). * GTN (abnormal serum hCG). * Active viral hepatitis. * Severe
­decompensated cirrhosis. * Liver tumours (benign and malignant). * Liver enzyme-inducing medication.
◆	Continuation of a POP in women with: * Current ischaemic heart disease. * Stroke
(history of cerebrovascular accident). * Headaches, migraine with aura.
• UKMEC 2 – can initiate POP in women with history of ectopic pregnancy, ovarian cyst,
VTE, stroke, ischaemic heart disease, or migraine with aura.

Other medical issues
• No evidence that the efficacy of POPs is reduced in women weighing > 70 kg and, therefore,
the licensed use of one pill per day is recommended.
• No evidence of a causal association between POP and weight change, cardiovascular disease
(MI, VTE, stroke), breast cancer, or headache.
• Mood change can occur with POP use, but there is no evidence of a causal association for
depression.
• Women of any age with a history of migraine (with or without aura) may safely use POP.
• Women who develop new symptoms of migraine with aura while using POPs – advise to seek
medical advice, as investigation may be appropriate. Consider continued use. (UKMEC 3)

Progestogen-only injectable contraception

Medical issues
Background
•
•
•
•

Primary mode of action is prevention of ovulation.
Failure rate if given within every 12 weeks is < 4/1000 over 2 years.
There can be a delay of up to 1 year in the return of fertility after discontinuation.
Altered bleeding patterns usually occur. Up to 70% of DMPA users are amenorrhoeic at 1 year of
use. Up to 50% of POIC users discontinue by 1 year; the most common reason for discontinuation
is changes to bleeding pattern.
• Women who experience unacceptable bleeding – take history, assess risk of STIs, and consider
possible gynaecological pathology. Consider a COC pill (if appropriate) as a short-term treatment
for women who have unacceptable bleeding but wish to continue with this method.

• There is an association between DMPA use and weight gain.
• No evidence of a causal association between the use of POICs and mood change,
libido, or headache.
• POIC use is associated with a small loss of BMD, which is usually recovered after
discontinuation.
• No evidence available on the effect of DMPA on long-term fracture risk.
• Efficacy of POIC is not reduced with concurrent use of medication (including
antibiotics and liver enzyme-inducing drugs) and the injection intervals do not need to
be reduced.
• UKMEC for POIC use – see Chapter 57.

Assessment and when to start
• A medical history (including sexual history) to assess the appropriateness of POIC.
• Women aged < 18 years – DMPA can be used as first-line contraception after consideration of
other methods.
• Women using DMPA who wish to continue – review every 2 years to assess individual situations
and discuss the benefits and potential risks.
• Use may continue to age 50 years.
• POIC can be safely used by women who are breastfeeding.
• Women can start a POIC up to day 21 postpartum to provide immediate contraceptive protection.
If started after that time, advise another method of contraception or abstinence for 7 days.
• POIC may be given following miscarriage or termination. If started within 5 days after the
miscarriage/termination, then additional contraceptive or abstinence is not required.

Injections and follow-up
• Repeat injection of DMPA every 12 weeks (or every 8 weeks for NET-EN). If necessary, a repeat
POIC can be given up to 2 weeks early.
• A repeat injection of POIC can be given up to 2 weeks late (i.e., 14 weeks since the last DMPA and
10 weeks for NET-EN) without additional contraception (unlicensed).
• Review if any signs or symptoms of infection at the site of injection.

SECTION 8

Contraception

Progestogen-only implant

Medical issues
Background
•
•
•
•

Primary mode of action is prevention of ovulation.
Duration of use is 3 years.
Failure rate is < 1/1000 over 3 years. • No delay in return of fertility following removal of a POIM.
Likely bleeding patterns that may occur – 20% of users will have no bleeding; 50% will have
infrequent, frequent, or prolonged bleeding; and the bleeding patterns are likely to remain irregular.
• Early discontinuation (up to 43% within 3 years) of POIM is common.

Assessment and when to start
•
•
•
•

UKMEC for POIM use – see Chapter 57.
Take history (including medical and sexual history) to assess the appropriateness of the POIM.
POIM can safely be used by women who are breastfeeding.
Insert POIM:
* Up to and including day 21 postpartum with immediate contraceptive protection. If inserted
after day 21, advise condoms or abstinence for 7 days.
* Immediately following miscarriage or termination. If inserted > 5 days after miscarriage/
termination, then advise condoms or abstinence for 7 days.
• Implant insertion – use appropriate anaesthesia prior to insertion and removal of a POIM. Use of
prophylactic antibiotics to prevent endocarditis is not recommended for POIM insertion or removal.

Follow-up
• No routine follow-up is required.
• Review if: woman cannot feel the implant or it appears to have changed shape; any change to the
skin or pain around the site of the implant; becomes pregnant; develops any condition that may
contraindicate continuation of the method.
• Women who experience problematic bleeding – take a sexual history to establish STI risk and/or
investigate for gynaecological pathology if clinically indicated. Can offer mefenamic acid or ethinyl
oestradiol (EE) (alone or as an oral contraceptive).
• No evidence of a teratogenic effect of a POIM, but if a woman becomes pregnant and continues
with the pregnancy then remove the implant.
• Additional contraceptive or EC is not necessary prior to implant removal as long as women return
within 3 years, have immediate replacement, or immediately start another method of contraception.
• If difficulty arises with POIM removal (owing to deep insertion, failed insertion, or migration) –
refer for removal under ultrasound guidance.

• No evidence of a causal association between POIM and weight change, mood change,
loss of libido, or headache.
• Acne may improve, occur, or worsen.
• There is little or no increase in risk of VTE.
• No evidence of a clinically significant effect on BMD.
• Women with a BMI > 30 kg/m2 – can use a POIM without restriction and without a
reduction in contraceptive efficacy for the duration of the licensed use.
• Women of any age with a history of migraine (with or without aura) may use POIM.
• Women who develop new symptoms of migraine without aura while using POIM may
continue the method. (UKMEC 2)
• Women who develop new symptoms of migraine with aura while using POIM – review
and can consider continued use of POIM. (UKMEC 3)

Drug interactions
• Liver enzyme-inducing drug use over short term (< 3 weeks) – may continue with a
POIM. Advise additional contraception until 4 weeks after the liver enzyme-inducing
drug has been stopped.
• Advise to use alternative contraception if liver enzyme-inducing drugs are used long term.

http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/CBO9781316156513.057

Intrauterine contraception

Background
• Primary mode of action of Cu-IUD is prevention of fertilization.
• LNG-IUS works primarily by its effect on the endometrium preventing implantation; effects
on cervical mucus reduce sperm penetration.
• Failure rates at 5 years’ use: < 2% with TCu380A and TCu380S; <1% with the LNG-IUS.
• TCu380S and LNG-IUS are the most effective IUDs available.
• TCu380A and TCu380S can remain in place for 10 years and other Cu-IUDs for 5 years.
• TCu380S is the first-choice Cu-IUD to minimize the risks associated with reinsertion.
• LNG-IUS is licensed for 5 years of use as a contraceptive.
• No delay in return to fertility after removal of IUC.

Risk of STIs
• Take history (including sexual history), assess suitability for IUCs, and identify those at
higher risk of STIs.
• Prior to insertion of IUC:
* Women who are either at higher risk of STI or who request swabs – test for
C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae.
* For women at higher risk of STIs, if results are unavailable before insertion – consider
prophylactic antibiotics (at least to cover C. trachomatis).
* In asymptomatic women, there is no indication to test or treat other lower genital tract
organisms or delay insertion until the results of tests are available.
• Prophylactic antibiotics are NOT required for the insertion or removal of IUC in women
with conditions where the risk of infective endocarditis may be increased.

Eligibility and when to insert
• Choose an IUC based on medical eligibility and the woman’s preference.
• If women choose a Cu-IUD – TCu380S is recommended as it is the most effective and has
the longest duration of use.
• A Cu-IUD and LNG-IUS can be inserted at any time in the menstrual cycle if it is
reasonably certain that the woman is not pregnant.
• May be inserted any time after miscarriage if there is no suspicion that the pregnancy
is ongoing.

Insertion of IUC
• Discuss and administer pain relief when appropriate.
• Perform a pelvic examination. • Assess pulse rate and BP.
• Use a ‘no-touch’ technique when sounding the uterine cavity and inserting IUC. If this
technique is used then sterile gloves are not required.
• Stabilize the cervix with forceps and assess the length of the uterine cavity to facilitate
fundal placement to reduce the risk of perforation.
• Document appropriate pre- and post-insertion counselling, the insertion procedure, and the
type of device inserted.

Risks or side effects
• Uterine perforation – up to 2/1000 insertions.
• Risk of expulsion – 1/20; most common in the first year, particularly within 3 months of
insertion. There are no differences in the rates of expulsion between different Cu-IUDs and
between Cu-IUDs and LNG-IUS.
• Overall risk of ectopic pregnancy is reduced with use of IUC when compared to no
contraception, and no particular device is associated with a lower rate of ectopic
pregnancy.
• There may be an increased risk of pelvic infection in the 20 days following insertion of
IUC, but the risk is the same as for the non-IUD-using population thereafter.
• Spotting, light bleeding, heavier or prolonged bleeding are common in first 3–6 months of
Cu-IUD.
• Irregular bleeding and spotting are common in the first 6 months after insertion of the
LNG‑IUS, but by 1 year, amenorrhoea or light bleeding is usual.
• LNG-IUS – systemic absorption of progestogen occurs; however, rates of discontinuation
due to side effects (such as acne and headache) are not significantly different from those of
Cu-IUD users.
• Ovarian cysts may occur with LNG-IUS, but they are rarely a clinical problem.

Follow-up
• Give instructions on how to check for the coil threads and advise to seek help if they are
unable to feel them (expulsion or perforation). Use alternative contraception until they seek
medical advice.
• Advise to seek medical assistance at any time if they develop symptoms of pelvic infection,
pain, persistent menstrual abnormalities, missed period, non-palpable threads, or they can
feel the stem of the IUD.
• Follow-up routinely after the first menses following insertion of IUC or 3–6 weeks later.

259

• After counselling (about declining fertility, risks associated with insertion, and
contraceptive efficacy), women who have a Cu-IUD inserted at the age of 40 years or over
can retain the device for 1 year after the LMP if aged over 50 years (or 2 years if under
50 years), or until contraception is no longer required.
• Women who have the LNG-IUS inserted at the age of 45 years or over, for contraception,
can retain the device until the menopause is confirmed or until contraception is no
longer required.

Contraception

CHAPTER 57 UKMEC category and definition for the use of the contraceptive method
• UKMEC category and definition for the use of the contraceptive method
1 – No restriction.
2 – Advantages of using the method generally outweigh the risks.
3 – Theoretical or proven risks usually outweigh the advantages. The provision of a method requires expert clinical judgement and/or referral to a specialist contraceptive provider, as use of the method is not
usually recommended unless other more appropriate methods are not available or acceptable.
4 – An unacceptable health risk.

CHAPTER 58 Quick starting contraception

Background
• Traditionally, initiation of contraception was delayed until the onset of the next menstrual
period in order to avoid inadvertent use during pregnancy. Starting early in the cycle also
avoids the need for additional contraception. Some methods may be started up to day 5 or
day 7 (LNG-IUS) of the menstrual cycle without the need for additional contraception.
• ‘Quick starting’ – starting contraception at the time a woman requests contraception,
rather than waiting for the next menstrual cycle.
• May also mean starting a method immediately after the use of EC. In this situation, there
is a possibility of EC failure and pregnancy. Such practice is outside the licence. Consider
it on an individual basis.

• Quick starting contraceptive methods can be started at any point in the menstrual cycle if
reasonably certain that the woman is not currently pregnant or at risk of pregnancy.
• As sperm may be viable in the female reproductive tract for up to 7 days, consider if a
woman is at risk of becoming pregnant as a result of UPSI within the last 7 days.
• The probability of pregnancy from a single act of UPSI in the first 3 days of the cycle is
negligible. There is a theoretical concern that women with a short menstrual cycle may
ovulate very early in their cycle, putting them at risk of pregnancy if contraception is started
as late as day 5 or day 7 (LNG-IUS). FPA advises additional contraception for women in
this situation, if they have a cycle shorter than 23 days.

Potential benefits

Potential disadvantages

• Quick starting may reduce the time a woman is at risk of pregnancy; prevent her
forgetting information on correct use of the method; prevent waning enthusiasm for the
method and use of a less reliable alternative method; avoid patient costs and barriers
to return for contraception, and reduce healthcare costs by reducing the number of
appointments.
• Women who have taken EC or who have irregular cycles may have a longer wait for
their next menses. There is a 2–3-fold higher risk of pregnancy in women who have other
episodes of UPSI in the same cycle that EC has been given compared to those who abstain.
Quick starting is expected to reduce unintended pregnancy rates by improving initiation
and continuation of contraceptives compared to conventional start methods.
• While there is currently a paucity of evidence demonstrating effectiveness, there are data
to suggest women find quick starting acceptable.

• A small risk of woman being already pregnant or failure of EC.
• Diagnosis of pregnancy may be delayed if amenorrhoea is assumed to be a result of the
contraceptive method or if bleeding is mistaken for a period.
Effects of fetal exposure to steroid hormones – theoretical concerns that HC may be harmful to
the fetus. There have been no consistent findings of specific fetal abnormalities.
• Animal studies – very high doses of progestogens may cause masculinization of female
fetuses. A very small number of cases of clitoral enlargement have been reported in humans
but there have been no reports of serious abnormalities.
• Dianette after the 45th day of pregnancy could cause feminization of male fetuses (phase of
embryogenesis at which differentiation of the external genitalia occurs).
• Pregnancies conceived with a Cu-IUD in situ are not associated with congenital
abnormalities but may be associated with an increased risk of miscarriage.
• Risks with the LNG-IUS may be higher owing to direct in utero exposure to progestogen.
Teratogenicity (especially virilization) cannot be completely excluded, but in cases where
pregnancies have continued with the LNG-IUS, there is no evidence of birth defects.
Bleeding pattern – may be associated with more disruption to a woman’s usual bleeding
­pattern than when initiating contraception at the beginning of the menstrual cycle.
Insertion of IUCs – no evidence that the cervix dilates during menses or that insertion of an
IUD is easier at this time.

• Quick starting contraception is likely to be an acceptable option for women requesting contraception, and may offer some
benefits, with no strong evidence of adverse effects. Where appropriate, offer an immediate start of the method of choice or a
bridging method as an alternative to waiting until the next menstrual period.
• Quick starting method may be continued as an ongoing method of contraception or it may be used as a temporary ‘bridging’
method until pregnancy can be excluded and a longer-acting method initiated.
• If a woman prefers to delay starting contraception or if she is concerned about potential risks, she may wait until her next period
or until risk of pregnancy has been excluded.

SECTION 8

Contraception

Assessment – woman attending for contraception or EC
Discuss options.
Assess risk of STIs and offer test.
Assess risk of pregnancy and offer pregnancy test.

Can pregnancy be reasonably excluded? Not at risk of pregnancy from recent UPSI:

• One can be ‘reasonably certain’ that a woman is not currently pregnant if any one or more of the following criteria is met
and there are no symptoms or signs of pregnancy:
* She has not had intercourse since LMP. * She is within the first 7 days of the onset of a normal LMP.
* She has been correctly and consistently using a reliable method of contraception.
* She is within the first 7 days post-abortion or miscarriage.
* She is within 4 weeks postpartum (for non-lactating women).
* She is fully or nearly fully breastfeeding, amenorrhoeic and < 6 months postpartum.
• A pregnancy test adds weight to the exclusion of pregnancy, but only if ≥ 3 weeks since the last episode of UPSI.
• Consider if a woman is at risk of becoming pregnant as a result of UPSI within the last 7 days.

Yes

No

Woman’s preferred method available?

Yes
Offer immediate initiation of any contraceptive
method at any time in the cycle, unless the
woman prefers to wait until her next period.

No
Offer CHC, POP, or POIC as
bridging methods and discuss
additional contraception.

Is she eligible for EC?
Cu-IUD may only be ‘quick started’ if pregnancy
is reasonably excluded or if the criteria for use
as EC are met, owing to the increased risk of
miscarriage.
LNG-IUS is not effective as EC. Do not use it to
quick start if there has been a risk of conception.

Yes
Can preferred method be started now?

Yes
• Consider quick starting of CHC, POP, or POIM.
• Offer a bridging method for women requesting
the POIC, but immediate start is acceptable
if other methods are not appropriate or
acceptable.

No
• Offer bridging method such as pill, patch,
ring as first-line. • POIC is second-line,
as the injectable cannot be removed or
stopped immediately if pregnancy is
diagnosed; offer only if other methods are
not appropriate or acceptable.

• Advise additional contraception.
• Pregnancy test ≥ 3 weeks since last UPSI.

Yes

No

Oral EC

Criteria for quick starting contraception fulfilled? – ensure that the woman
is:
• Likely to continue to be at risk of pregnancy.
• She has expressed a preference to begin contraception immediately.
• Aware that there is a possibility of pregnancy.
• Inform that there is a theoretical risk from fetal exposure to
contraceptive hormones but most evidence indicates no harm.
• Aware that pregnancy cannot be excluded until she has had a
pregnancy test no sooner than 3 weeks after the last episode of UPSI.
• Given advice on additional contraceptive precautions.

No
Delay contraception until next period or ≥ 3 weeks since last UPSI.

Follow-up

• Inform women of the need for additional contraceptive precautions and
pregnancy testing. The timing of the pregnancy test should be no sooner
than 3 weeks after the woman’s last episode of UPSI.
• Inform women that bleeding during or soon after stopping HC is not the
same as a natural period and even regular withdrawal bleeds on CHC may
not be a reliable indicator that a woman is not pregnant.

Pregnancy diagnosed after starting contraception
• If the woman wishes to continue the pregnancy, stop or remove the method.
• Contraceptive hormones are not thought to cause harm to the fetus and do not advise to terminate the
pregnancy for this reason.
• If a woman is using the POIM and she opts to abort the pregnancy, the implant can be left in situ for
ongoing contraception.
• IUD in situ is associated with increased risks of second-trimester miscarriage, preterm delivery, and
infection if left in situ. Removal in the first trimester is thought to reduce the overall risk of adverse
outcomes but is associated with a small risk of miscarriage. If the threads are visible, or can easily be
retrieved from the endocervical canal, remove the IUC up to 12 weeks’ gestation. Do not remove IUDs
if pregnancy is diagnosed after 12 weeks’ gestation.

SECTION 8

Contraception

CHAPTER 59 Unscheduled bleeding with hormonal contraception (HC)

Expected bleeding patterns after commencing HC

Background and definition
• Unscheduled bleeding – breakthrough bleeding, spotting, prolonged or frequent bleeding.
• Exact mechanism of unscheduled bleeding associated with HC is unknown.
• Oestradiol exposure during the follicular phase is responsible for endometrial proliferation.
Exposure to progesterone in the luteal phase results in secretory differentiation. Progesterone
is anti-oestrogenic and inhibits endometrial growth and glandular differentiation. It is the
withdrawal of oestrogen and progesterone that triggers the onset of menstrual bleeding.
• Endometrial response to HC reflects circulating sex hormone concentration, dose, route,
formulation of steroid delivery, and the timing and duration of administration.
• Before starting HC, advise women about the expected bleeding patterns, both initially and in
the longer term.
• See Chapter 57 categories for use of HC by women with vaginal bleeding.
• POC are more likely to present with unscheduled bleeding than CHCs. Bleeding with POP is
less likely to settle than bleeding with the POIC.

History
To identify or exclude the possible causes of unscheduled bleeding:
• Assess compliance, current contraception, and the duration of use.
• Bleeding pattern before starting HC, since starting, and current pattern.
• Need for examination and investigation depends on the presence of any other symptoms
suggestive of an underlying cause such as abdominal or pelvic pain, PCB, dyspareunia, or
heavy bleeding.
• Identify risk of STIs – abnormal bleeding may be a presenting symptom of C. trachomatis.
• Cervical screening history. • Rule out the possibility of pregnancy.
• Use of medications that may interact with the contraceptive method, or any illness that may
affect the absorption of orally administered hormones.

Examination
• Speculum examination can identify cervical conditions (polyps or ectopy) and the very
occasional case of cervical cancer. Indicated if:
* Persistent bleeding beyond the first 3 months’ use.
* New symptoms or a change in bleeding after at least 3 months’ use of a method.
* Woman has not participated in a cervical screening programme. * Requested by the woman.
* After a failed trial of the medical management.
* There are other symptoms such as pain, dyspareunia, or PCB.
• The 3-month cut-off is a guide only, as some methods such as the IUS or POIM may commonly
cause bleeding even after the first 3 months of use.
• Bimanual examination if there are symptoms such as IMB or PCB, pelvic pain, or pressure
symptoms suggestive of a structural or histological abnormality.

CHC (pill, patch, or ring)–
• Up to 20% of COC users have irregular bleeding.
• No significant differences between pill or patch.
• Ovarian activity is effectively suppressed.
POP: • One third of women have a change in bleeding and 1/10 have frequent bleeding.
• Bleeding may not settle with time and ovarian activity is incompletely suppressed.
• Long term: 10–15% are amenorrhoeic; up to 50% have a regular bleed; 30–40% have
irregular bleeding.
POIC: • Bleeding disturbances (spotting, light, heavy, or prolonged bleeding) are common.
• Up to 35% are amenorrhoeic at 3 months.
• Up to 70% are amenorrhoeic at 1 year.
POIM: • Bleeding disturbances are common.
• After 6 months’ use, 30% have infrequent bleeding; 10–20% have prolonged bleeding.
• Long term: 20% are amenorrhoeic; 50% have infrequent, frequent, or prolonged bleeding,
which may not settle with time.
IUS: • Irregular, light, or heavy bleeding is common (in the first 6 months).
• 65% have amenorrhoea or reduced bleeding at 1 year, with a 90% reduction in menstrual
blood loss over 12 months of use.

Examination is not necessary
• Unscheduled bleeding in the first 3 months after starting a new HC is common.
• Ensure there are no risk factors for STIs, no concurrent symptoms suggestive of underlying
causes, and the woman is participating in the National Cervical Screening Programme (NCSP).
• Some women may be happy to continue with the method after this initial assessment but plan
follow-up as bleeding may persist.

Investigations
• Women who are at risk of STIs – test for C. trachomatis as a minimum. Testing for
N. gonorrhoeae will depend on sexual risk and local prevalence. A self-obtained low vaginal
swab or a first-void urine if a speculum examination is not being performed can be done.
• Cervical smear in women who are not participating in an NCSP.
• Pregnancy test if there is a possibility of incorrect use (missed pills, late injection, or expelled
IUS), drug interactions, or illness which may lead to malabsorption of oral hormones.
• Endometrial biopsy – perform in women aged ≥ 45 years or in women aged < 45 years with risk
factors for endometrial cancer (e.g., obesity or PCOS), who have persistent unscheduled bleeding
after the first 3 months of starting a method or who present with a change in bleeding pattern.
• The role of uterine polyps, fibroids, or ovarian cysts as a cause of unscheduled bleeding
is limited. Nevertheless, if such a structural abnormality is suspected, a TVS and/or
hysteroscopy may be indicated.

http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/CBO9781316156513.060

Management
• Bleeding with HC is common in the first few months of use and delay treatment until after the first 3 months.
• No evidence to suggest that bleeding patterns with one POC will predict the likely bleeding patterns with another POC.

CHC

POP

POIM

• Unscheduled bleeding is less common with CHC than
with POCs.
• Do not change a COC pill within the first 3 months of use
as bleeding disturbances often settle in this time.
• For women using a COC pill, use the lowest dose of EE
to provide good cycle control. The dose of EE can be
increased to a maximum of 35 μg to provide good cycle
control.
• Although some studies suggest bleeding may be better
with COCs containing certain progestogens, it is not
evident in systematic reviews.
• No evidence to support the use of a continuous regimen
over the cyclical regimens to improve bleeding.
• Insufficient evidence to recommend the use of a biphasic
and triphasic COC to improve bleeding patterns.

• There is lack of evidence on the effective treatment of
bleeding in women using POPs.
• No evidence to suggest that one POP is associated with
less bleeding than any other (including the desogestrelonly pill).
• Although bleeding may settle with time, there is no
definite time frame in which women can expect bleeding
to stop or improve.
• There is no evidence that bleeding improves with two
POPs per day, although this has been used in clinical
practice.
• There is no evidence that changing the type and dose of
POPs will improve bleeding, but this may help some.

• Women using an LNG implant (Norplant) – some
evidence of a beneficial effect of mefenamic acid or EE
(alone or as a COC) on bleeding patterns.
• Mifepristone may be beneficial but there is limited
evidence to support its use in routine clinical practice.

POIC

LNG-IUS

• No evidence on the use of a low-dose (< 50 μg) COC to treat unscheduled bleeding with
POIC. Despite this, use of EE (given as a COC) is advised as a short-term treatment option
up to 3 months, if there are no contraindications to use of oestrogen. The COC can be taken
in the usual cyclic manner or continuously without a pill-free interval.
• For women who have a contraindication to COC, consider mefenamic acid for 5 days. It can
reduce the length of a bleeding episode but has little effect on bleeding in the longer term.
• Mifepristone – one RCT reported a significant reduction in breakthrough bleeding compared
to placebo.
• There is some evidence that a COX-2 inhibitor (valdecoxib) is effective in the treatment
of uterine bleeding with DMPA; however, the use of COX-2 inhibitors for this purpose is
unlicensed in the UK.

• No evidence on treatment options for women with unscheduled bleeding with the
LNG-IUS.
• Provide information about bleeding patterns likely to be experienced.

For women with unscheduled bleeding using a POIC, POIM, or IUS who wish to continue with the
method and are medically eligible, a COC may be used for up to 3 months (cyclically or continuously).

SECTION 8

Contraception

CHAPTER 60 Missed pill

Key elements

Definition – a missed pill is defined as one that is more than 24 hours late.
If >1 pill is missed, the rule applies to consecutive pills.
The rule applies to active pills.

• If it is reasonably certain that the woman is not pregnant, COCs can be initiated on any day
of the menstrual cycle. Additional contraception is required for the first 7 days if the pill is
started after day 5 of the cycle.
• If one active pill is missed, there is no need to take additional precautions.
• If two active pills are missed, advise additional precautions for the next 7 days.

CHC

If one pill has been missed (> 24–48 hours late)

• To continue contraceptive cover – advise to:
* Take the missed pill as soon as it is remembered.
* Continue the remaining pills at the usual time.
• To minimize the risk of pregnancy – EC is not usually
required, but consider EC if pills have been missed earlier
in the packet or in the last week of the previous packet.

If ≥ 2 pills have been missed (> 48 hours late)

• To continue contraceptive cover – advise to:
* Take the most recently missed pill ASAP.
* Continue the remaining pills at the usual time.
* Use condoms or abstain from sex until 7 consecutive
active pills have been taken. This advice may be
overcautious in the second and third weeks, but the
advice is a backup in the event that further pills are
missed.

• If pills are missed in the first week (pills 1–7) – consider
EC if UPSI occurred in the pill-free interval or in the first
week of pill-taking.
• If pills are missed in the second week (pills 8–14) – no
indication for EC if the pills in the preceding 7 days have
been taken consistently and correctly (assuming the pills
thereafter are taken correctly and additional contraceptive
precautions are used).
• If pills are missed in the third week (pills 15–21) – advise
to omit the pill-free interval by finishing the pills in the
current pack (or discarding any placebo tablets) and
starting a new pack the next day.

Progestogen-only pill

Traditional POPs (Micronor, Noriday, Norgeston, Femulen): > 3 hours late (> 27
hours since the last pill was taken).
Desogestrel-only (Cerazette): > 12 hours late (> 36 hours since the last pill was taken).

Progestogen-only Pills. Faculty of Sexual and Reproductive Healthcare, CEU, November 2008 (updated June 2009).

Advice:
• To take a pill as soon as remembered.
• If > 1 pill has been missed – just take one pill. Take the next pill at the usual
time. This may mean taking two pills in one day.
• An additional method of contraception (condoms or abstinence) for the next
2 days (48 hours after the POP has been taken) is required.

CHAPTER 61 Contraceptive choices for young people

History for medical eligibility
• Young people have specific risks relating to pubertal development and risk of STIs.
• Take into account factors such as ability to adhere with contraception, eating disorders, family
situation, obesity, and recreational drug/alcohol use.
• General health – prescription medications, drug use, smoking, alcohol use, non-prescription
drugs, diet, and physical activity levels; HPV vaccination.
• Sexual and reproductive health – age at menarche, regularity of menstrual cycles, LMP, history
of any pregnancy and its outcome.
Current and previous partners in last 6 months; relationship with the partner(s) – casual/
regular/long-term; gender of partner(s); age of partner(s); type of sex practised – vaginal, oral,
or anal sex; STI information and any past history of STI.
• Family history of any significant medical problems (e.g., heart disease, diabetes, VTE).
• Social history – do they go to school or work? Who lives at home? Any problems at home?
Whether the partner or parents know about her visit. Any problems at school/college/work?
Preferences for contraception. How well can she remember pills? Any problems in the past
with using a particular contraceptive? How to access condoms and use them, etc.

Starting HC in young people
• Do not use regular HC prior to menarche. Advise condoms in young people
requiring contraception before this time.
• POEC can be given to pre-menarchal women if required.
• ‘Quick starting’ may be appropriate as waiting may result in the individual
never starting the method, because of waning enthusiasm or the inconvenience
of rescheduling an appointment.
• Categories for each method in relation to age – see Chapter 57.
• There are no restrictions on using any of the methods based on nulliparity alone.
• Age alone should not limit contraceptive choices, including intrauterine methods.

Prevalence and background
• Choice of contraception is influenced by effectiveness, discretion, safety, side effect profile,
invasiveness, ease of use, or how difficult it is to forget.
• Among women aged 16–29 years who are at risk of pregnancy, about 78% use the
contraceptive pill and/or the condom.
• LARC is used by a minority of women; there is a trend towards increasing use.
• Use of POICs and POIMs is greater in young women compared with older women.

Consultation – to improve compliance
• In women aged < 20 years – contraceptive failure rate is 16% in the first 12 months of use,
compared with a rate of 8% in married women aged ≥ 30 years.
• LARC methods are less user-dependent, have lower failure rates with typical use, and are
more cost-effective than COC or condoms if used for 1 year or longer.
• Discontinuation of methods may also be a factor in unintended pregnancies. Side effects
(perceived or experienced) are often cited as the reason for method discontinuation.
Aim to maximize a young person’s compliance:

• Provide a wide and appropriate choice of methods, dealing with specific health concerns,
discussing specific health benefits, and providing appropriate follow-up.
• Develop rapport and create a safe and comfortable environment during the consultation.
• Be friendly and non-judgemental. • Allow as much time in the consultation as they need.
• Maintain confidentiality.
• Avoid making assumptions about reason for visit; sexual behaviour, sexual orientation, risk
or capacity based on age, gender, or disability.
• Avoid appearing to moralize about sex, sexuality, and contraceptive choice, and be aware of
cultural and sexual diversity.
• When accompanied by an adult, see the young person alone if possible.

Emergency contraception
• Use of EC is common in those aged < 30 years. EC may be influenced by factors such as
perceived pregnancy risk, personal and perceived attitudes towards EC, and confidence in
asking for it.
• POEC can be given if there is likely to be a delay between the initial consultation and IUD
insertion.
• Offer all women Cu-IUD even if they present for EC within 72 hours of UPSI.

275

STIs
• Young people account for 65% of chlamydia, 55% of genital warts, and 50% of gonorrhoea
cases diagnosed in UK GUM clinics.
• Advise on correct and consistent use of condoms to reduce the risk of STIs.
• Offer chlamydia testing for sexually active young people aged < 25 years. Encourage them to
have regular STI testing, particularly when there has been a new sexual partner.
• UPSI – offer STI screening and repeat screening 12 weeks later to detect any recently acquired
infection, as antibodies to HIV and syphilis may take up to 12 weeks to be detected.
• High-risk sexual exposure or assault – consider HIV post-exposure prophylaxis.

SECTION 8

Contraception

Health concerns and risks

Weight gain

Bleeding patterns and dysmenorrhoea

Mood changes and depression

• No evidence of weight gain with COC use.
• Weight gain can occur with DMPA, but there is little
evidence of a causal association between other POCs and
weight gain. DMPA use may be associated with a gain of
2–3 kg in weight over 1 year.
• Explore other lifestyle factors such as levels of physical
activity and diet.

• Altered bleeding patterns can occur with HC. They are
common with POCs, including the LNG-IUS.
• Primary dysmenorrhoea may improve with CHC.
• Likely causes of unscheduled bleeding with the COC
include missed pills, STIs, and malabsorption.
• Amenorrhoea may be normal and unscheduled bleeding
does not necessarily mean reduced efficacy if the method
has been used correctly.

• HC may be associated with mood changes but there is no
evidence that HCs cause depression.
• Pre-menstrual mood is largely unchanged by CHC
use, but may improve in some women and deteriorate
in others. It may be influenced by a prior history of
depression.

Thrombosis

Acne

• COCs containing second-generation progestogens such as LNG and NET are the first-line
choice for young women.
• Standard dose (30 μg or 35 μg) COCs may offer advantage of better cycle control and lower
risk of pregnancy with imperfect use.
• A low-dose (20 μg EE) COC may be appropriate for women who experience side effects at
higher doses.
• Factors such as immobility and obesity may increase an individual’s risk of VTE, and use of a
contraceptive method may be contraindicated or advised with caution.

• COC can improve acne. If acne fails to improve with COC, consider switching to a COC
containing a less androgenic progestogen or one with a higher oestrogen content.
• Co-cyprindiol is indicated to treat severe acne that has not responded to oral antibiotics. In
those with less severe symptoms, withdraw it 3–4 months after the condition has resolved.
For women with known hyperandrogenism, longer use with specialist review may be
warranted. It can be restarted at any time if acne or hirsutism recurs on stopping treatment.
• Acne does not appear to be associated with DMPA use.
• POIM may be associated with improvement or worsening of acne.
• While there may be an increased risk with the LNG-IUS, it is not usually a reason for
discontinuation.

1.

Bone health

Fertility

• Women of reproductive age – CHCs do not appear to affect BMD but
DMPA may reduce BMD. DMPA is associated with a small loss of BMD
that is usually recovered after discontinuation. Use it in women of < 18
years of age only after considering other methods.
• Review women who wish to continue using DMPA every 2 years to
reassess the benefits and risks.

• There is no delay in return of fertility following discontinuation of the
POP, CHC, IUC or the POIM.
• There can be a delay of up to one year in the return of fertility after
discontinuation of DMPA.

CHAPTER 62 Contraception for women aged over 40 years

History and assessment
• Take sexual and reproductive history to assess the risk of STIs
and sexual function.
• Take medical history as medical conditions are more common
in this age group and could impact on contraceptive choice.
• Assess social factors such as frequency of intercourse,
natural decline in fertility, sexual problems, wish for noncontraceptive benefits, menstrual dysfunction, etc.
• Smoking and BMI.
• Age – see Chapter 57 and table below.

Background – sexual and reproductive
health in women aged over 40 years
• Fertility – although a natural decline in fertility occurs from the mid-30s, effective contraception is required to prevent
an unintended pregnancy.
• Change of partner – average age for men and women to get divorced in the UK is 44 and 41 years, respectively.
Many individuals in their 40s may therefore enter new relationships. There has also been a rise in the number of STIs
diagnosed in > 40 year olds.
• Pregnancy – there is an increasing trend in the UK for women to have children later in life. The greatest increase in
birth rate is seen in women aged ≥ 40 years, with the numbers nearly doubled from 1998 to 2008. At the same time,
women in their 40s also experience unintended pregnancies. The rate of TOP in women aged 40–44 years is 4/1000 in
the UK, which is almost equivalent to the rates for young women aged < 16 years.
• Risks of pregnancy – see Obstetrics: evidence-based algorithms.
• Transition to menopause – women in their 40s and 50s move from normal ovulatory menstrual cycles to the cessation
of ovulation and menstruation. During this time, intermittent ovulation occurs, resulting in irregular menstrual cycles.

Options
• None of the contraceptive options is contraindicated based on age alone.
• 4 most commonly used methods are sterilization (male or female), the pill,
male condoms, and intrauterine methods.

Combined hormonal contraception

Progestogen-only contraception

Non-hormonal contraception

LARC

Emergency contraception

• There are no restrictions to the use of EC based on age alone.
• See Chapter 64.

SECTION 8

Contraception

Options: CHC – health benefits and risks associated with CHC use

Bone health – CHC in the peri-menopause may help to maintain
BMD.
Dysmenorrhoea and cycle control, menopausal symptoms:

• CHC can provide cycle regularity, improve primary
dysmenorrhoea, or reduce menstrual blood loss.
• CHC may improve some of the symptoms associated with
menopause. Women experiencing menopausal symptoms
while using CHC may try an extended regimen.
Ovarian cancer and endometrial cancer:

• CHC provides protection against ovarian cyst, ovarian cancer,
and endometrial cancer.
• Risk of breast cancer increases with increasing age. There
is no clear evidence as to the risk of breast cancer with use
of CHC.

Cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease:

VTE:

• Morbidity and mortality from VTE, MI, or stroke are rare but the risk
increases with age. Overall the absolute risks are small and women who
have used oral contraceptives have no higher risk of mortality than those
who have never used them.
MI and stroke – risk is influenced by smoking, HT, and migraine with aura.
Smoking – a very small increase in the risk of MI in smokers.
• As both smoking and age are independent risk factors, greater restrictions
are placed on the use of CHC methods depending on the number of
cigarettes smoked and age (see Chapter 57).
• After smoking cessation, risk of MI associated with smoking reduces with
time, and therefore for former smokers aged > 35 years, the use of CHC
becomes less restrictive. (UKMEC 2)
HT – hypertensive individuals who use CHC are at higher risk of stroke and
acute MI but not VTE compared to hypertensive non-CHC users. Even for
women with adequately controlled HT, alternative methods are preferable to
CHC. (UKMEC 3)
Migraine – risk of stroke is increased in CHC users with migraine compared to
CHC users without migraine. Risk of stroke affects those with migraine with
aura and CHC use further increases the risk of ischaemic stroke. CHC methods
represent an unacceptable health risk in presence of migraine with aura.
(UKMEC 4)

• The relative risk of VTE is increased
with use of CHC. Reducing the dose of
oestrogen from 30 μg to 20 μg may reduce
the risk of VTE.

Prescribing CHC methods to women aged over 40 years:

•
•
•
•
•

First choice of pill is the one containing the lowest dose of EE that provides adequate cycle control, i.e., pill with < 30 μg EE.
In women who are aged ≥ 35 years and smoke, risks outweigh benefits.
There may be a very small increased risk of ischaemic stroke with CHC.
Advise women with cardiovascular disease, stroke, or migraine with aura against the use of CHC.
HT may increase the risk of stroke and MI. Check BP before and at least 6 months and monitor at least annually thereafter.

Options (contd.)

POCs – health benefits and risks associated with POC

LARCs

HMB:

• POCs may be useful in the management of HMB and irregular bleeding because of the
associated amenorrhoea.
• LNG-IUS is an option for HMB, which is particularly common in women aged > 40 years.
Bone health:

• Failure rates are lower than shorter-acting methods and are more cost effective.
• There is no delay in return of fertility with LARCs other than with the POICs, which can be
delayed for up to 1 year after discontinuation. This may be unacceptable to those women
who still wish to conceive, given the rapid decline in background fertility in this age group.
• LARC (POIM and the IUS) can be as effective as sterilization and offer a reliable, reversible
alternative for women who do not want to be sterilized or for whom sterilization is not advised.

• The POIC DMPA is associated with a small loss of BMD, which usually recovers after
discontinuation. For women aged > 40 years, there is some reassuring evidence from small
studies to support DMPA use in women approaching menopause.
• Women aged > 45 years – DMPA is UKMEC Category 2. DMPA can be used until maximum
recommended age of 50 years, provided a re-evaluation of the risks and benefits of treatment
for all women is carried out every 2 years in those who wish to continue use.
• Consider alternative methods of contraception for women with significant lifestyle and/or
medical risk factors for osteoporosis.
• There is no evidence of a clinically significant effect of other POCs on BMD.
Cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease – be cautious when prescribing DMPA to women
with cardiovascular risk factors because of the effects of progestogens on lipids.

Non-hormonal methods
Cu-IUD – menstrual bleeding problems are common in women aged > 40 years and
also common in users of intrauterine methods. Spotting, heavier or longer periods,
and pain are common in the first 3–6 months following Cu-IUD insertion.These
bleeding patterns are not harmful and usually settle with time; however, advise
women to seek medical help to exclude gynaecological pathology and infection if
the bleeding problems persist or occur as new events.
Sterilization – inform about the lower failure rate and lower risk of major complications associated with vasectomy compared to laparoscopic tubal occlusion.
Barrier contraception – there is no restriction on the use of barrier methods based
on age alone.
Natural family planning – when approaching the menopause, natural family
planning may become more difficult owing to menstrual cycle irregularity and the
increase of anovulatory cycles making it difficult to interpret ovulatory mucus.
Withdrawal – although not promoted as a method of contraception, coitus interruptus is reported by approximately 6–8% of women aged 40–49 years. Withdrawal,
if used correctly (i.e., withdrawal before ejaculation every time), may work for some
couples, particularly as a backup to other methods. However, it may be less effective
than other methods of contraception.

SECTION 8

Contraception

Stopping contraception

Non-hormonal methods

LNG-IUS

Hormonal methods

• Can stop non-HC 1 year after the LMP in those aged
> 50 years, and 2 years after the LMP in those aged < 50
years. The probability of menstruation (and ovulation)
after a year of amenorrhoea for women aged > 45 years is
estimated to be 2–10%.
• Women who have a Cu-IUD containing ≥ 300 mm2 Cu,
inserted at ≥ 40 years, can retain the device until the
menopause or until contraception is no longer required.
• Remove IUD once contraception is no longer required.

• > 75% of women will have amenorrhoea or light bleeding
in spite of ovulation.
• Women with LNG-IUS inserted at the age of ≥ 45 years
and who are using the LNG-IUS solely for HMB can
continue until the menopause.
• Women with LNG-IUS inserted for contraception at
the age of ≥ 45 years can use the device for 7 years (off
licence) or if amenorrhoeic until the menopause, after
which remove the device.
• Discuss the risks of pregnancy over the age of 50 years,
and the risks of removal and replacement. If bleeding/
spotting occurs, this indicates ovarian follicular activity,
in which case remove and replace the device or provide
alternative contraception.

• In women using exogenous hormones, amenorrhoea is
not a reliable indicator of ovarian failure. FSH is not
a reliable indicator of ovarian failure in women using
combined hormones, even if measured during the HFI.
• FSH levels may be used to help diagnose menopause,
in women > 50 years using POCs. Women > 50 years who
are amenorrhoeic and wish to stop POC – check FSH
levels. If the level is ≥ 30 IU/L, repeat FSH after 6 weeks.
If the second FSH level is ≥ 30 IU/L, contraception can be
stopped after 1 year.

• In general, contraception may be stopped at the age of 55 years; however, tailor to the individual
woman. Advise women who are not using HC and continue to have regular menstrual bleeding at
the age of 55 years to continue with some form of contraception.
• Women > 50 years – do not use CHC or the POIC beyond the age of 50 years. Switch to an
alternative method such as the POP, POIM, LNG-IUS, or barrier method until the age of 55 years
or until the menopause can be confirmed.

Method

Age < 50 years

Age ≥ 50 years

CHC

Can continue up to age 50 years.

Stop at age 50 years and switch to a non-hormonal method or POCs (except DMPA).

Non-hormonal

After 2 years of amenorrhoea.

After 1 year of amenorrhoea.

DMPA

Can continue up to age 50 years.

Stop DMPA at age 50 years and switch to:
• A non-hormonal method and stop after 2 years of amenorrhoea.
• Or the POP, implant, or LNG-IUS.

POP, implant, or
LNG-IUS

Can continue to age 50 years or longer.

Continue method:
• If amenorrhoeic.
* Check FSH levels and stop method after 1 year if serum FSH is ≥ 30 IU/L on
two occasions, 6 weeks apart.
* Or stop at age 55 years when natural loss of fertility can be assumed for most
women.
• If not amenorrhoeic, consider investigating any abnormal bleeding or changes
in bleeding pattern, and continue contraception beyond age 55 years until
amenorrhoeic for 1 year.

HRT and contraception
Follow-up
• Advise women to seek medical help:
* If any problems with their contraception.
* Or change in medical history that may influence contraceptive choice.
* Or when they reach 50 years of age.
* If new symptoms of pain, irregular or heavy bleeding.
* If bleeding problems do not settle within 3–6 months of IUD/IUS insertion.
• After the menopause, remove the intrauterine methods as cases of actinomyces-like organisms
and pyometra have very occasionally been reported in postmenopausal women with IUDs.

• Advise women using HRT not to rely on this as contraception.
• POP can be used with HRT to provide effective contraception, but the HRT must include
progestogen in addition to oestrogen.
• Women using oestrogen replacement therapy may use the LNG-IUS to provide endometrial
protection. When used as the progestogen component of HRT, change the LNG-IUS no later
than 5 years after insertion (the licence states 4 years), irrespective of age at insertion.

SECTION 8

Contraception

CHAPTER 63 Postnatal contraception

Starting contraception – assess
• Contraceptive needs (e.g., degree of efficacy required); sexual activity and function;
woman’s own beliefs, attitudes, and personal preferences; cultural practices that may
impact on choice of method; whether a woman is breastfeeding; whether ovulation is
likely to have resumed; whether there is any possibility of pregnancy.
• Social factors (e.g., return to work, ability to access services).
• Medical history (e.g., HT, migraine, VTE, obesity, HIV, cholestasis, GTN).
• Risk of STIs.

Provision of contraceptive advice
• Delaying future pregnancies may be beneficial as short inter-pregnancy intervals are
associated with increased risk of poor perinatal outcome and risks to maternal health.
• Discuss contraception within the first week of delivery. (NICE)
• Postpartum contraception advice may be better delivered antenatally.
• Women who have required fertility treatment in the past are not necessarily infertile and
may now require contraception.
• Risk of STIs – offer condoms to reduce STI either alone or as backup to other
contraceptive methods.

Natural methods
Fertility awareness-based methods – in breastfeeding women, delay the use of fertility
awareness-based methods if the woman is < 6 weeks postpartum. From 6 weeks onwards,
advise caution even if menses have begun.
Lactational amenorrhoea method (LAM) – breastfeeding provides protection against
unintended pregnancy. It can be started straight away.
• LAM is > 98% effective if: woman is amenorrhoeic, < 6 months postpartum, fully
breastfeeding with no long intervals between feeds day or night (e.g., > 4 hours during day
and > 6 hours at night).
• Risk of pregnancy is increased if the frequency of breastfeeding decreases (stopping night
feeds, supplementary feeding, use of pacifiers), when menstruation returns or when
> 6 months postpartum.

Background – postnatal fertility
• There is a wide variation in the time from delivery to resumption of sexual activity.
• Although return of menstruation is often the first sign of fertility, waiting for the first
menstrual period before starting contraception may put some women at risk of pregnancy.
• Within 30 days of delivery, placental sex steroid levels decrease and gonadotrophins
increase, stimulating ovarian activity.
• Breastfeeding women:
* Suckling disrupts the frequency and amplitude of gonadotrophin pulses and despite
ovarian follicular activity, ovulation is suppressed.
* Ovulation returns when the frequency and duration of suckling episodes decrease.
* Menstruation occurs on average 28 weeks and ovulation 34 weeks after delivery.
• Prior to day 21 postpartum, no contraception is required.
• Non-breastfeeding women – ovulation may occur as early as day 28. As sperm can
survive for up to 7 days in the female genital tract, contraception is required from day 21
onwards.
• Women who are fully breastfeeding may wish to rely on the lactational amenorrhoea
method (LAM) alone. Women who are breastfeeding and wish to avoid pregnancy should
use contraception. As fertility is reduced, any contraceptive method will be more effective.

• See Chapter 57: categories for methods that are applicable to breastfeeding and nonbreastfeeding women.
• If starting an HC on or before day 21, there is no need for additional contraception.
• If starting an HC after day 21, make sure that the woman is not pregnant or at risk of
pregnancy, and advise to avoid sex or use additional contraception for the first 7 days of
use (2 days for POP), unless fully meeting LAM criteria.
• LARC methods are less user-dependent, provide the best protection against pregnancy, and
may be more cost-effective.
• With regard to contraceptive choices for obese women, only CHC and sterilization are
associated with potential risks.

Emergency contraception
• Both the Cu-IUD and POEC can be used. POEC can be used from day 21 onwards and
the emergency Cu-IUD from day 28 onwards.
• As the earliest date of ovulation is predicted to be day 28, if UPSI occurs on days 21–27,
the Cu-IUD can be used from day 28 until day 33 (i.e., 5 days after the earliest expected
ovulation). Cu-IUD inserted for EC can be retained until the next menstrual period or it
can be retained for ongoing contraception.
• UPSI or contraceptive failure before day 21 postpartum is not an indication for EC.

http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/CBO9781316156513.064

Contraceptive options – hormonal

CHC

POCs

• Not recommenced before day 21 owing to the increased risk of VTE.
• Non-breastfeeding women may start CHC from day 21 postpartum.
• Breastfeeding women – avoid CHC in the first 6 weeks postpartum as there is insufficient
evidence on safety of CHC while establishing breastfeeding.
• Contraceptive hormones are excreted in breast milk in very small amounts, and there is
concern about their potential impact on infant growth and development. However, HC
including COC do not appear to affect infant development adversely.
• Insufficient evidence on whether CHC affects breast milk volume.
• CHC between 6 weeks and 6 months is not recommended unless other methods are
not acceptable or available. In partially breastfeeding women, the benefits of CHC may
outweigh the risks.

No adverse effects on breastfeeding, infant growth, or development have been shown with
POP, DMPA, Implanon, LNG-IUS, or the Cu-IUD.

POP

POIC

• Postpartum women (breastfeeding and
non-breastfeeding) can start the POP at
any time postpartum.
• If starting POP after day 21, advise
additional contraception for the first 48
hours.
• Women wishing to move from LAM to
an HC – no additional contraception is
required in the first week of starting a POC
as long as the conditions for LAM are still
being met during this first week.

• Non-breastfeeding women – can start a
POIC at any time postpartum.
• Breastfeeding women – do not start a
POIC before day 21 unless the risk of
subsequent pregnancy is high.
• Breastfeeding women – use of DMPA
< 6 weeks postpartum is outside the
product licence.
• Troublesome bleeding can occur with use
of DMPA in the early puerperium.

POIM
• Implanon – insert between 21 and 28 days after delivery; it can be used during
lactation.
• Women can choose POIM before day 21, although this is outside the product
licence. There is no evidence to suggest that Implanon is more likely to cause
bleeding when inserted at this time, but advise women to report bleeding problems
so that other causes can be excluded.

LNG-IUS
• LNG-IUS – insert from day 28 postpartum.
• Advise women to avoid sex or use additional contraception for 7 days
after insertion unless fully meeting LAM criteria.
• See intrauterine methods below.

Contraceptive options – non-hormonal

Intrauterine methods: Cu-IUD

• Immediate postpartum insertion is safe and
effective, although expulsion rate may be higher.
• UKMEC – owing to increased risk of perforation,
delay insertion until 4 weeks postpartum.
• Unless a Cu-IUD can be inserted within the first
48 hours postpartum, delay insertion until day 28
onwards.
• No additional contraception is required.

Barrier methods

Sterilization

• Condoms (male and female) can be used at any time postpartum.
Even in the presence of another contraceptive method, advise
correct and consistent use of condoms to protect against STIs.
• Diaphragms and caps are not recommended until 6 weeks
postpartum when changes to the genital tract anatomy are
complete and discomfort has usually resolved. A different size of
diaphragm or cervical cap may be required. Another method of
contraception should be used from day 21 until the woman is able
to insert and remove a correctly fitted diaphragm or cap.

• Permanent method: inform about risks, benefits, failure
rates, and other methods of contraception including LARC.
• Some LARC methods have failure rates comparable with
female sterilization.
• There is no medical condition that would absolutely
contraindicate sterilization, although precautions may be
necessary in some cases.
• Vasectomy is associated with lower failure rate and lower
risk of major complications compared to tubal occlusion.

SECTION 8

Contraception

CHAPTER 64 Emergency contraception

History for medical eligibility

Background and definition

• Consider the following factors when assessing a woman’s need for EC:
* Medical eligibility. 			
* The most likely date of ovulation based on the date of the LMP and the
usual cycle length.
* Number and timing of all episodes of UPSI in the current cycle.
* Previous EC use within current cycle.		
* Drug interactions – use of medications that may affect contraceptive
efficacy.
* Details of potential contraceptive failure (e.g., how many pills were missed
and when).
* Need for additional precautions/ongoing contraception.
* Efficacy of method.
* Individual choice.
• BMI: obese women (BMI > 30) using LNG are at greater risk of pregnancy
compared with those with a normal or low BMI. While an increased risk is
also noticed amongst UPA users, the difference is not statistically significant.
More evidence is needed before specific recommendations can be made.
Currently, all EC methods are recommended in obese women and it is not
recommended to increase the dose of oral EC.

• EC is a means of preventing unintended pregnancy following any UPSI. It is
commonly supplied for ‘off license’ indications.
• Three methods available in the UK as EC:
* Copper-bearing intrauterine device (Cu-IUD).
* Levonorgestrel; progestogen-only emergency contraception (POEC).
* Ulipristal acetate (UPA).
• 2002 judicial review concluded that pregnancy begins at implantation and not
at fertilization. Explain the possible mechanisms of action to the patients as
some methods may not be acceptable, depending on individual beliefs about
the onset of pregnancy and abortion.
• Although EC has been shown to reduce the risk of pregnancy at an individual
level, it has not shown to impact on overall unintended pregnancy or TOP
rates in women with increased access (including advance provision) or at a
population level. This may be because even with advance provision, women
do not use EC on every occasion of UPSI and EC is used too infrequently by
those women most at risk of pregnancy.

Determining a woman’s precise risk of pregnancy

Investigations
• Pregnancy test – if a woman has been at risk earlier in the cycle, consider
pregnancy test. A pregnancy test cannot reliably exclude pregnancy if there
has been an episode of UPSI < 3 weeks previously.
• Prevalence of Chlamydia infection among women presenting for EC is up to
9% in women aged < 25 years. Offer STI testing including HIV. For women
at risk of STIs, if test results are unavailable before IUD insertion, consider
prophylactic antibiotics, at least to cover Chlamydia.

• This is complex as it depends on a number of factors including when
ovulation is likely to have occurred, the fertility of both partners, and whether
contraception has not been used or has been used incorrectly.
• In clinical practice, it is difficult to determine the precise timing of ovulation.
The length of the luteal phase is relatively constant at 14 days. The follicular
phase is more variable.
• Conception is most likely to occur following UPSI on the day of ovulation
or in the preceding 24 hours. Owing to the natural variation in timing of
ovulation, the timing of the ‘fertile period’ is highly variable, particularly
among women with irregular cycles, and there are only a few days in the
menstrual cycle when women are not theoretically at risk of pregnancy. The
probability of pregnancy from a single act of UPSI in the first 3 days of the
cycle appears to be negligible.

Indications for EC

UPSI or barrier failure during the time that additional
­contraceptive precaution is required

• When starting the hormonal methods of contraception.
• POIC – late injection (> 14 weeks since last injection of
DMPA or > 10 weeks since NET-EN).

Missed pills – if UPSI or barrier failure
• COCs (other than Qlaira):
* If ≥ 2 active pills are missed.
* If the pills are missed in week 1.
• If the pill-free interval is extended – consider an
emergency IUD up to 15 days after taking the 21st
pill in the last packet, providing the preceding pills
have been taken correctly.

Liver enzyme-inducing drugs

POP – if UPSI or barrier failure
• Before efficacy has been re-established (i.e., 48 hours after
restarting).
• Late or missed pill (> 27 hours since last traditional POP or
> 36 hours since last desogestrel-only pill).
• Timing of ovulation after missed pills cannot be predicted
accurately. An emergency IUD is therefore only recommended
up to 5 days after UPSI.

Cu-IUD and LNG-IUS

While on CHC, POP, and POIM:• UPSI, barrier failure, or failure to use additional contraception
while using liver enzyme-inducing drugs or in the 28 days
after use.
• EC – Cu-IUD or a double dose (3 mg) of LNG is
recommended.
• UPA is not recommended.

• If UPSI has occurred in the 5 days prior to:
* Removal without immediate replacement.
* Partial or complete expulsion.
* Threads missing, perforation, and IUD/IUS location
unknown.
• Depending on the timing of UPSI and time since IUD known
to be correctly placed, it may be appropriate to fit another
IUD for EC.

Recommendations
• Cu-IUD can be inserted up to 120 hours after the first episode of UPSI or up to 5 days after the
earliest expected date of ovulation, because of the low failure rate.
• UPA is effective up to 120 hours and can be offered to all eligible women during this period. It is
the only oral EC licensed for use between 72 and 120 hours.
• The efficacy of LNG has been demonstrated up to 96 hours; its efficacy between 96 and 120 hours
is unknown. Use of LNG beyond 72 hours is outside the product licence.
• Ideally, insert an emergency IUD at first presentation, but where this is not possible, provide oral
EC in the interim.
• Consider advance supply of EC, but there is no evidence to support routine provision.

ovulation.

Within 72 hours of UPSI or contraceptive failure:

Within 120 hours of UPSI or contraceptive failure:

• Efficacy of LNG has been demonstrated up to
72 hours after UPSI. There is uncertainty about
its effectiveness thereafter. Risk of pregnancy on
days 2, 3, and 4 after UPSI was not significantly
different from that on day 1, suggesting that LNG
is effective for up to 96 hours.
• However, compared to day 1, LNG administered
on day 5 increases the risk of pregnancy nearly
6-fold.

• The efficacy of UPA has been demonstrated up to
120 hours after UPSI, with no apparent decline
in efficacy within that period.

is thought to work primarily by inhibition of ovulation.

ovulation.

• Copper is toxic to the ovum and sperm and the Cu-IUD is
effective immediately after insertion and works primarily
by inhibiting fertilization. If fertilization has already
occurred, it may have an anti-implantation effect.
• The mean time from ovulation to implantation is 9 (range
6–18) days. Therefore, to ensure that an IUD is inserted
before the process of implantation begins, the Cu-IUD
should be fitted within the first 5 days (120 hours)
following first UPSI in a cycle or within 5 days from the
earliest estimated date of ovulation.

• It prevents follicular rupture or causes luteal
dysfunction. LNG taken prior to the LH surge
results in ovulatory dysfunction in the subsequent
5 days. It can thus inhibit ovulation for 5–7 days,
by which time any sperm in the reproductive tract
will have become non-viable.
• LNG is no better than placebo at suppressing
ovulation when given immediately prior to
ovulation and is not effective once the process of
fertilization has occurred.
• LNG does not affect embryo–endometrial
attachment.

• If administered immediately before ovulation,
UPA suppresses growth of lead follicles.
• The contribution of the endometrial changes
to the efficacy of UPA (e.g., by inhibiting
implantation) is, as yet, unknown.

Drug interactions

No drug interactions.

Double the dose with liver enzyme inducers.

Not recommended with liver enzyme inducers.

• The efficacy of Cu-IUDs is unaffected by concomitant
drug use.

• Drugs that induce enzymes decrease the
contraceptive efficacy of LNG, while using them
and for 28 days afterwards. Women on liver
enzyme-inducing drugs or who have stopped using
them (≤ 28 days ago) who require EC – offer a CuIUD as the efficacy is not affected by drugs.
• Women taking liver enzyme-inducing drugs (or
who have stopped within the last 28 days), and
who decline or are not eligible for a Cu-IUD – give
a dose of 3 mg LNG (two Levonelle tablets) ASAP
within 120 hours of UPSI. The efficacy of LNG
after 96 hours is uncertain.
• HIV – post-exposure prophylaxis after sexual
exposure (PEPSE) and EC may be required
simultaneously. It is recommended to use 3 mg
LNG (two tablets) if a Cu-IUD is not available or
not acceptable.

• No interaction studies have been carried out
to date. Not to use with liver enzyme-inducing
drugs and for 28 days after these are stopped.
• Not to be used concomitantly with drugs that
increase gastric pH (e.g., antacids, histamine H2
antagonists, and proton pump inhibitors).
• Do not double the dose of UPA.
• As a progesterone receptor modulator, it blocks
the action of progestogen and, therefore, could
reduce the efficacy of contraceptives containing
progestogen.
• Additional precautions for 7 days in addition to:
* 7 days for starting HC (i.e., 14 days total).
* 2 days for the POP (i.e., 9 days if starting or
continuing the POP).
* 9 days for Qlaira (i.e., 16 days for Qlaira).
• Theoretically there is a risk that progestogen
could also block the action of UPA but, to date,
there is no evidence to support or refute this.

Side effects

• Pain – pain relief may facilitate insertion. Analgesics
commonly used are NSAIDSs, topical lidocaine
(Instillagel), and cervical local anaesthetic block.

• Nausea in 20% of women using LNG EC and vomiting in 1%. If a woman vomits within 2 hours of
taking LNG, or within 3 hours of UPA – offer a repeat dose of the same method or a Cu-IUD.
• Altered bleeding patterns – advise regarding menstrual disturbances after oral EC use. If there is any doubt
about whether menstruation has occurred, perform a pregnancy test ≥ 3 weeks after UPSI.
• It does not increase the chance of ectopic pregnancy. A previous ectopic pregnancy is not a
contraindication.
• Other side effects – headaches, abdominal pain, dysmenorrhoea, and dizziness.

More than once in a cycle

NA

Can be used.

Not recommended.

• Giving repeated doses of LNG may be effective and
further UPSI may be an indication for repeat LNG
use.
• Cochrane review – LNG used on a regular basis
for pre- and post-coital contraception seemed
reasonably efficacious and safe.
• As there is no evidence to indicate that LNG is not
safe in pregnancy, LNG can be used more than
once in the same cycle or can be used for a recent
episode of UPSI, even if there has been an earlier
episode of UPSI outside the treatment window (>
120 hours).
• No data regarding a minimum time interval
between successive LNG treatments. However, if
further UPSI occurs within 12 hours of a dose of
LNG, further EC treatment is not required.

• It is not advised to use UPA more than once
per cycle, or if there has been another episode
of UPSI, outside the treatment window (> 120
hours).
• There are limited data on its safety in pregnancy;
therefore, where multiple episodes of UPSI have
occurred and there is a risk that a woman may
already be pregnant, its use is not advised.
• If a Cu-IUD is declined or is inappropriate, LNG
can be given for another episode of UPSI after
administration of UPA. It is not known if UPA
reduces the efficacy of LNG or how long after
UPA administration any such interaction has an
effect.

SECTION 8

Contraception

Future contraception

• May continue using the Cu-IUD for ongoing
contraception.
• If the woman does not require contraception or prefers
another method, the Cu-IUD can be removed after
pregnancy has been excluded, providing there has been
no UPSI in the 7 days prior to removal, and guidance for
switching methods is followed.

• These methods do not provide contraceptive cover for subsequent UPSI and women will need to
use contraception or refrain from sex to avoid further risk of pregnancy. For options and additional
contraceptive precautions, see Chapter 58.

Failure of EC

Should be managed as EC.

If a woman chooses to continue her pregnancy after exposure to UPA, this should be reported to the manufacturer of ellaOne for inclusion in the European register to monitor outcomes of exposure during pregnancy.

FOLLOW-UP
• Offer follow-up if women want a pregnancy test, STI screening, Cu-IUD removal, or they have any concerns
or difficulties with their contraception.
• If a Cu-IUD is to be used as an ongoing contraceptive method, advise women to return for a follow-up visit
after the first menses (or 3–6 weeks) after insertion.

Guideline comparator – SOGC recommendations

What not to do

• Hormonal EC can be offered up to 5 days after UPSI.
• Two types of hormonal EC are available in Canada:
* A regimen of 2 oral doses of 750 μg LNG taken 12 hours apart.
* Yuzpe method – 2 doses of 100 μg of EE and 500 μg of LNG taken orally 12 hours apart. Ovral is the most commonly
used product, with 2 tablets of Ovral being equivalent to 1 dose of the Yuzpe regimen.
• WHO – pregnancy rate of 1.1% with the LNG-only regimen, compared to 3.2% for the Yuzpe regimen.
• Hormonal EC – although they have generally been used only up to 72 hours after UPSI, the Yuzpe and LNG regimens have
been shown to be effective when taken between 72 and 120 hours. The range of effectiveness seems to be slightly lower than
before 72 hours.
• LNG prevented 95% of pregnancies for up to 24 hours, 85% for 25–48 hours, and 58% for 49–72 hours. Corresponding
figures for the Yuzpe regimen were 77%, 36%, and 31%, respectively.
• The Yuzpe and LNG-only regimens reduce the risk of pregnancy by about 25% and 11%, respectively, but this does not mean
that 25% of women using the Yuzpe regimen will become pregnant. Theoretically, if 100 women had UPSI once during the
second or third week of their cycle, about 8 would become pregnant; following treatment with the Yuzpe regimen, only 2
would become pregnant, a reduction of 75%.
• A Cu-IUD can be used up to 7 days after UPSI.
• A meta-analysis – IUDs inserted within 5 days of UPSI are significantly more effective than hormonal EC, with an
effectiveness rate of 98.7%.
• Use of a post-coital Cu-IUD between 5 and 7 days is less well studied; extending insertion of an IUD up to 7 days after UPSI
may be acceptable if it falls within 5 days of the ovulation day.
• LNG EC regimen is more effective and causes fewer side effects than the Yuzpe regimen.
• Either 1 double dose of the LNG EC regimen (1.5 mg) or the regular 2-dose LNG regimen (0.75 mg each dose) may be used,
as they have similar efficacy with no difference in side effects.
• The anti-progestin mifepristone (RU 486) has been shown to be a highly effective post-coital contraceptive, but this product is
not currently available.
• Women of reproductive age should be provided with a prescription for hormonal EC in advance of need.

• No need to increase the dose of oral EC in women with high
BMI.
• UPA is contraindicated in:
* Women with hypersensitivity to UPA or any of the other
components and pregnancy.
* Women with severe asthma insufficiently controlled by oral
glucocorticoids.
• UPA – caution in women with hepatic dysfunction, hereditary
problems of galactose intolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency,
or glucose–galactose malabsorption.
• UPA – breastfeeding is not recommended for up to 36 hours.
• UPA – current recommendations:
* Not to use with liver enzyme-inducing drugs and for 28
days after these are stopped.
* Not to be used concomitantly with drugs that increase
gastric pH (e.g., antacids, histamine H2 antagonists, and
proton pump inhibitors).
• Do not double the dose of UPA.
• POEC – if further UPSI occurs within 12 hours of a dose of
LNG, further EC treatment is not required.
• Do not use UPA more than once in a cycle or concomitantly
with LNG.
• Do not use UPA more than once per cycle or if there has been
another episode of UPSI outside the treatment window (> 120
hours).
• Do not insert the LNG-IUS following administration of EC,
and offer an alternative ‘bridging’ method until pregnancy can
be excluded.

Contraception

CHAPTER 65 Long-acting reversible contraception (LARC)

History and assessment

Prevalence and background

• Take history on menstrual, contraceptive, sexual, medical, and family history.
• Exclude pregnancy. • Assess risk for STIs.
• Provide information on: * Contraceptive efficacy. * Duration of use.
* Risks and possible side effects. * Non-contraceptive benefits. * Procedure
for initiation and removal/discontinuation. * When to seek help while using
the method.

• Contraceptive methods that require administration less than once per cycle or month.
* Cu-IUD and progestogen-only methods (IUS, injectables, and the implants).
• About 8% of women aged 16–49 years in UK use LARC as a method of contraception.
• LARC’s effectiveness does not depend on daily compliance.
• LARC methods are more cost effective than the COCs.
• IUDs, IUS, and implants are more cost effective than the injectable contraceptives.

Progestogen-only injectable contraceptives
DMPA, NET-EN

Contraceptive efficacy and effect on periods
•
•
•
•
•

POICs act primarily by preventing ovulation. Pregnancy rate is < 4/1000.
Pregnancy rate with DMPA is lower than that with NET-EN.
Repeat DMPA every 12 weeks and NET-EN every 8 weeks.
There could be a delay of up to 1 year in the return of fertility after stopping POICs.
Amenorrhoea is likely; this is more likely with DMPA than NET-EN; is more likely as time goes
by, and is not harmful.
• Up to 50% of women stop using DMPA by 1 year. The most common reason for discontinuation
being altered bleeding pattern, including persistent bleeding.

Practical details of giving POICs
• Give POICs by deep IM injection into the gluteal or deltoid muscle or the lateral thigh.
• Start POICs (provided that it is reasonably certain that the woman is not pregnant):
* Up to and including 5th day of the menstrual cycle (no need for additional contraception).
* At any other time in the menstrual cycle with an additional barrier contraception for the first
7 days after the injection.
* Immediately after first or second-trimester abortion, or at any time thereafter.
* At any time postpartum.

Follow-up and managing problems
• Repeat injection can be given to women attending up to 2 weeks late for repeat injection, without
the need for additional contraceptives.
• Persistent bleeding associated with DMPA – treat with mefenamic acid or ethinyl oestradiol.
• Women who wish to continue DMPA use beyond 2 years – review and discuss the balance
between the benefits and potential risks.
• Pregnancy during DMPA use – there is no evidence of congenital malformation to the fetus.

Risks and possible side effects
• DMPA may be associated with an increase of up to 2–3 kg in weight over 1 year.
• DMPA is not associated with acne, depression, or headaches.
• DMPA is associated with a small loss of BMD, which is largely recovered on
discontinuation. There is no evidence that DMPA increases the risk of fracture.

Specific groups, medical conditions, and contraindications
for POICs
• Owing to the possible effect on BMD, be cautious with the use of DMPA in:
* Adolescents.
* Women > 40 years.
• However, the benefits outweigh the risks in the above groups, and it may be
given if other methods are not suitable or acceptable.
• Women with a BMI > 30 can safely use DMPA and NET-EN.
• Women who are breastfeeding can use POICs.
• All progestogen-only methods may be used by women who have migraine with
or without aura.
• DMPA is safe for women if oestrogen is contraindicated.
• Not contraindicated in women with diabetes.
• DMPA may be associated with a reduction in the frequency of seizures in women
with epilepsy.
• DMPA is safe and effective in women with STIs, including HIV/AIDS.
• Women taking liver enzyme-inducing medication may use DMPA and the dose
interval does not need to be reduced.

Progestogen-only subdermal implants
Implanon

Contraceptive efficacy and effect on periods
•
•
•
•
•

Implanon acts by preventing ovulation.
Pregnancy rate with Implanon is < 1/1000 over 3 years.
Implanon has UK Marketing Authorisation for use for 3 years.
No evidence of a delay in the return of fertility following removal of implants.
Bleeding patterns – 20% of women will have no bleeding, while 50% will have infrequent,
frequent, or prolonged bleeding. Bleeding patterns are likely to remain irregular over time.
• Dysmenorrhoea may be reduced with the use of Implanon.

Risks and possible side effects
• Up to 43% of women stop using Implanon within 3 years; 33% of women
stop because of irregular bleeding and < 10% of women stop for other reasons
including hormonal (non-bleeding) problems.
• Implanon use is not associated with changes in weight, mood, libido, or
headaches.
• Implanon use may be associated with acne.

Specific groups, medical conditions, and contraindications
for POIMs

Practical details of giving POIMs
• Insert Implanon (provided that it is reasonably certain that the woman is not pregnant):
* At any time (but if the woman is amenorrhoeic or it has been more than 5 days since
menstrual bleeding started, advise additional barrier contraception for first 7 days after
insertion).
* Immediately after abortion in any trimester.
* At any time postpartum.
• Implanon insertion and removal both cause some discomfort and bruising but technical
problems are unusual (< 1/100).

Follow-up and managing problems

•
•
•
•
•
•

No evidence that the effectiveness or adverse effects of implants vary with age.
Women > 70 kg can use Implanon as an effective method of contraception.
Contraceptive implants can safely be used by women who are breastfeeding.
Implanon use is not contraindicated in women with diabetes.
Implanon is safe and effective in women with STI, including HIV/AIDS.
All progestogen-only methods, including contraceptive implants, may be used by
women who have migraine with or without aura.
• Implants are medically safe for women to use if oestrogen is contraindicated.
• There is no evidence of an effect of Implanon use on BMD.
• Implanon is not recommended as a contraceptive method for women taking liver
enzyme-inducing drugs.

• No routine follow-up is needed after implant insertion.
• Irregular bleeding associated with implant – treat with mefenamic acid or ethinyl oestradiol.
• There is no evidence of a teratogenic effect of Implanon use but if a woman becomes
pregnant and continues with the pregnancy, remove the implant.
• If an Implanon implant cannot be palpated (due to deep insertion, failed insertion, or
migration) – localize by ultrasound scan for removal. Refer to an expert for deeply inserted
implants.

SECTION 8

292

Contraception

IUD and IUS

Contraceptive efficacy
• IUDs – act by preventing fertilization and inhibiting implantation.
Licensed duration of use for IUDs (380 mm2 Cu) is 5–10 years, depending on the type of device.
Pregnancy rate with IUDs (380 mm2 Cu) is < 20/1000 over 5 years.
Up to 50% of women stop using IUDs within 5 years; the most common reasons being
unacceptable vaginal bleeding and pain.
• IUS – acts mainly by preventing implantation and sometimes by preventing fertilization.
Licensed duration of use for IUS is 5 years for contraception.
Pregnancy rate – < 10/1000 over 5 years.
Up to 60% of women stop using the IUS within 5 years. The most common reasons are
unacceptable vaginal bleeding and pain; a less common reason is hormonal problems.
• No evidence of a delay in the return of fertility following removal of IUDs/IUS.

Before fitting an IUD/IUS
• Test for:
* Chlamydia trachomatis in women at risk of STIs.
* Neisseria gonorrhoeae in women from areas where the disease is prevalent and who are at
risk of STIs.
* Any STIs in women who request it.
• If testing for STIs is not possible, or has not been completed, give prophylactic antibiotics to
women at increased risks of STIs.
• Insert IUS/IUD (provided that it is reasonably certain that the woman is not pregnant):
* At any time during the menstrual cycle.
* IUS – if the woman is amenorrhoeic or it has been > 5 days since menstrual bleeding started;
advise additional barrier contraception for the first 7 days after insertion.
* Immediately after first or second-trimester abortion, or at any time thereafter.
* From 4 weeks postpartum, irrespective of the mode of delivery.

Advice for women at time of fitting
• Inform women:
* Symptoms of uterine perforation or infection that would warrant an early review.
* Insertion may cause pain and discomfort for a few hours and light bleeding for a few days.
* How to check for the presence of IUD/IUS threads and encourage to do this regularly with
the aim of recognizing expulsion.
• Women who are aged ≥ 45 years at the time of IUS insertion and who are amenorrhoeic may
retain the device until they no longer require contraception, even if this is beyond the duration
of UK Marketing Authorisation.
• Women who are aged ≥ 40 years at the time of IUD insertion may retain the device until they
no longer require contraception, even if this is beyond the duration of the UK Marketing
Authorisation.

Risks and possible side effects
• IUD – heavier bleeding and/or dysmenorrhoea.
• IUS – irregular bleeding and spotting are common during the first 6 months.
Oligomenorrhoea or amenorrhoea is likely by the end of the first year.
• There is no evidence that IUD/IUS use affects weight.
• Changes in mood and libido are small and similar with IUDs and IUS.
• Risks:
* Uterine perforation at the time of insertion: < 1/1000.
* PID following insertion: < 1/100 in women who are at low risk of STIs.
* Expulsion: < 1/20 women in 5 years.
* Ectopic pregnancy when using IUDs/IUS is lower than when using no contraception.
• Risk of ectopic pregnancy when using the IUD/IUS is 1/1000 in 5 years. If a woman
becomes pregnant with the IUD/IUS in situ, the risk of ectopic pregnancy is 1/20.
• IUS – there may be an increased likelihood of developing acne as a result of absorption of
progestogen, but only a few women discontinue IUS use for this reason.

Specific groups, medical conditions, and contraindications
for IUD and IUS
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

May be used by adolescents, but consider STI risk where relevant.
Not contraindicated in nulliparous women of any age.
Women of all ages can use them.
Can be used by women who are breastfeeding and by women with a history of VTE.
Not contraindicated in women with diabetes.
Can be safely used in women who are HIV-positive or have AIDS.
Effectiveness of the IUS is not reduced when taking any other medication.
All progestogen-only methods, including the IUS, may be used by women who have
migraine with or without aura.
• IUS is medically safe for women to use if oestrogen is contraindicated.

Follow-up and managing problems
• Follow-up the women after the first menses, or 3–6 weeks after insertion, to exclude
infection, perforation, or expulsion.
• Heavier and/or prolonged bleeding associated with IUD – treat with NSAIDs and
tranexamic acid. Consider changing to IUS in women who find heavy bleeding associated
with IUD use unacceptable.
• Presence of actinomyces-like organisms on a cervical smear in a woman with a current
IUD – assess to exclude pelvic infection. Do not remove IUD routinely, in women without
signs of pelvic infection.
• Women who have an intrauterine pregnancy with an IUD in situ – remove IUD before
12 weeks of completed gestation, whether or not they intend to continue the pregnancy.

Continuous and extended hormonal contraception (SOGC)

Background and definition

Side effects

• Extended use refers to the use of COCs with planned hormone-free intervals (HFI) (from two
contiguous cycles), and continuous use refers to uninterrupted use without HFIs.
• A number of COCs have been studied using a range of continuous or extended (CECOC)
regimens. The length of the CECOC regimen can be altered, depending on the side effects.
• All currently available 50 µg EE contraceptives (oral [monophasic or multiphasic], transdermal,
vaginal) can be used in a CECOC regimen.
• A 3-day HFI can be considered. After a 3-day HFI, if the woman uses COCs, she must take the
next pill of her pack; if the woman uses the patch or the ring, she must use a new patch or a
new ring.
• CECOCs regimens are as effective as cyclic regimens in preventing pregnancy.
• In COCs users, frequent lack of compliance may lead to increased failure. Use of CECOCs may
be more ‘forgiving’ about missed pills because of the absence of a cyclical HFI.

• The frequency of unscheduled bleeding with a CECOC regimen is similar to that of a
cyclical regimen and reduces over time.
• Evidence of lower frequency of side effects such as headaches, bloating, and menstrual pain
than cyclical regimen. The side-effect profile with CECOC regimens is not worse than with
cyclical regimens and may be better.
• If irregular bleeding and/or spotting persist with the use of CECOC regimen – rule out
pregnancy, non-compliance, cervical infection, smoking, malabsorption, and use of
concomitant medications.
• Short-term safety of CECOC regimens is similar to that of cyclical regimens.
• Evidence on long-term safety of CECOC regimens is currently unavailable.
• Greater exposure to EE over one year – although uncertain, studies do not indicate that side
effects are made worse with CECOC regimens and, in fact, such regimens may decrease
some of these side effects.

Medical/non-contraceptive usage
• A CECOC regimen compared with a cyclical regimen results in fewer total bleeding days.
• Endometriosis – CECOCs administered for 6 months are effective in reducing the frequency and
the intensity of dysmenorrhoea, deep dyspareunia, and non-menstrual pelvic pain.
• Women with HMB, including bleeding related to uterine fibroids, may benefit from menstrual
suppression with CECOC regimens.
• Women with haemorrhagic diatheses may consider CECOC regimens in order to decrease
monthly withdrawal bleeding.
• Menstrual migraine and headaches may improve with CECOC regimens.
• Women experiencing hormonal withdrawal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, breast
tenderness, bloating, swelling, and mood changes during the HFIs while using cyclical COCs
may benefit from CECOC regimens.
• Women in the peri-menopause with problematic bleeding and vasomotor symptoms may benefit
from CECOC regimens rather than cyclical regimens because of the elimination of the HFIs.
• For women in the peri-menopausal transition who may be ovulating, CECOC is preferred to
HRT for controlling problematic bleeding and vasomotor symptoms.
• Cost effectiveness – CECOC regimens are associated with significantly less menstrual hygiene
product consumption than cyclical regimens. Provided that the total annual cost of HC remains
lower than the total annual cost of menstrual-related products and medications, CECOC
regimens are cost saving for the individual compared with cyclical regimens.

SECTION 8

Contraception

CHAPTER 66 Male and female sterilization

Specific consent issues
Background and indications for sterilization
• 47,268 tubal occlusions and 64,422 vasectomies were performed in England in 1999.
• There are no absolute contraindications to sterilization of men or women.

History and assessment
• Take history and examine to rule out any concurrent conditions, which may require an
additional or alternative procedure or precaution.
• Provide advice, counselling, and access to other LARCs, including information on the
advantages, disadvantages, and relative failure rates of each method.
• As a precaution against the risk of later regret, take additional care when counselling
people under the age of 30 years or people without children.
• Take additional care in discussions with people taking decisions during pregnancy or in
reaction to a loss of relationship, or who may be at risk of coercion by their partner or
family, or health or social welfare professionals.
• Take into account cultural, religious, psychosocial, psychosexual, and other
psychological issues, some of which may have implications beyond fertility.
• If there is any question of a person not having the mental capacity to consent to a
procedure that will permanently remove his/her fertility – refer the case to court.

• Discuss both vasectomy and tubal occlusion. Vasectomy carries a lower failure rate and has
fewer risks related to the procedure.
• Although the procedure is intended to be permanent, inform about the success rates
associated with reversal, should this procedure be necessary.
• These are associated with failure rates and pregnancies can occur several years after the
procedure.
* The lifetime risk of failure for tubal occlusion: 1/200.
* Filshie clips, after 10 years of use: 2–3/1000 procedures.
* The failure rate for vasectomy is 1/2000 after clearance has been given.
• In a small minority of men, non-motile sperm persist after vasectomy. In such cases, ‘special
clearance’ to stop contraception may be given when < 10,000 non-motile sperm/ml are
found in a fresh specimen examined at least 7 months after vasectomy, as no pregnancies
have been reported under these circumstances.
• Inform of risks of laparoscopy, particularly if they are at increased risk such as previous
abdominal surgery or obesity.

• If tubal occlusion fails, the resulting pregnancy may be an ectopic pregnancy. After tubal
occlusion, advise women to seek medical help if they think that they might be pregnant or
if they have abnormal abdominal pain or vaginal bleeding.
• No precautions can be guaranteed to avoid early pre-existing pregnancy, which may be
undetectable. Advise women to use effective contraception until the day of the operation
and to continue to use it until their next menstrual period.
• Advise men to use effective contraception until azoospermia is confirmed.
• Tubal occlusion is not associated with an increased risk of heavier or irregular periods
when performed after 30 years of age. There is an association with subsequent increased
hysterectomy rates, although there is no evidence that tubal occlusion leads to problems
that require a hysterectomy.
• Data are limited on the effect on menstruation when tubal occlusion is performed on
women under 30 years of age.
• There is no increase in testicular cancer or heart disease associated with vasectomy.
• There is a possibility of chronic testicular pain after vasectomy.

Sterilization procedures

Tubal occlusion

Vasectomy

• Can be performed at any time during the menstrual cycle provided that the woman has used
effective contraception up until the day of the operation. Otherwise, defer the operation until
the follicular phase of a subsequent cycle.
• Woman should use effective contraception until her next menstrual period.
• Wherever possible, perform tubal occlusion after an appropriate interval following pregnancy.
Women who request tubal occlusion postpartum or following abortion are at increased risk of
regret and the possible increased failure rate.
• If tubal occlusion is to be performed at the same time as a CS, counselling and agreement
should have been given at least one week prior to the procedure.
• A pregnancy test must be performed before the operation to exclude a pre-existing pregnancy.
However, a negative test does not exclude the possibility of a luteal phase pregnancy.
• Routine curettage at the time of tubal occlusion, in order to prevent a luteal phase pregnancy, is
not recommended.

• No-scalpel approach to identify the vas results in a lower rate of early complications.
• Division of the vas on its own is not an acceptable technique because of its failure rate.
Division should be accompanied by fascial interposition or diathermy.
• Do not use clips for occluding the vas, as failure rates are unacceptably high.
• Irrigation of the vas during vasectomy does not reduce failure rates or reduce time to
clearance.
• Perform vasectomy under local anaesthesia wherever possible.
• Send the excised portions of vas for histological examination only if there is any doubt
about their identity.

Laparoscopic approach

Other approaches

•
•
•
•

• When a mini-laparotomy is used as the method of approach for an interval
sterilization, any effective surgical or mechanical method of tubal occlusion
can be used.
• A modified Pomeroy procedure rather than Filshie clip application may
be preferable for postpartum sterilization using mini-laparotomy or at the
time of CS, as it leads to lower failure rates.
• Hysteroscopic methods for tubal occlusion – see next section of chapter.
• Do not use Culdoscopy as a method of approach.

Quicker and associated with less minor morbidity compared with mini-laparotomy.
Perform as a day case wherever possible.
Local anaesthesia is an acceptable alternative.
Topical application of local anaesthesia to the Fallopian tubes should be used whenever
mechanical occlusive devices are being applied.
Mechanical occlusion of the tubes by either Filshie clips or rings is the method of choice for
laparoscopic tubal occlusion.
Do not routinely use more than one Filshie clip.
Do not use diathermy as the primary method of tubal occlusion because it increases the risk of
subsequent ectopic pregnancies and is less easy to reverse than mechanical occlusive methods.
It should only be performed at a site where there are facilities to perform a laparotomy safely.

SECTION 8

Contraception

Hysteroscopic sterilization by tubal cannulation and placement of intra-Fallopian implants

Guidance
• Current evidence on its safety and efficacy is adequate to support its use provided that
normal arrangements are in place for clinical governance and audit.
• Additional contraception must be used until appropriate imaging has been done. There is a
small risk of pregnancy in the longer term after any form of tubal occlusion procedure.

Procedure
• Usually performed under local anaesthesia and/or intravenous sedation.
• A hysteroscope is inserted through the vagina and cervix. A flexible microinsert is passed
through the hysteroscope using a guidewire, and placed into each of the Fallopian tubes.
The microinserts induce scar tissue formation, which occludes the Fallopian tubes and
prevents conception.
• An additional form of contraception should be used until imaging has confirmed
satisfactory placement of the microinserts. Imaging may be by X-ray or ultrasound
scanning initially, followed by HSG in selected patients, or by HSG as a routine test to
confirm tubal blockage.

Efficacy
Seven case series reported:
• Successful bilateral placement of microinserts in 86–99%.
• Tubal occlusion was confirmed by HSG or the position of the microinserts confirmed by
X-ray or ultrasound, 3 months after the procedure in 91–99% of women.
• In some cases (19/1477) women had tubal patency at 3 months, but a second HSG at
6 months confirmed occlusion.
• 1-year pregnancy prevention rate of up to 98.9%.

Adverse events
•
•
•
•
•
•

Infection, vasovagal reaction.
Risk of ectopic pregnancy.
Microinsert expulsion and migration to the abdominal cavity: 1–4%.
Uterine or tubal perforation caused by improper microinsert placement: 1–2%.
Vaginal spotting and postoperative bleeding, postoperative pain, and cramping.
Pelvic pain – 5 case reports of 8 women who required subsequent procedures 6 days to
3 years after hysteroscopic sterilization to remove the microinserts because of pain.

What not to do
•
•
•
•
•
•

Routine curettage at the time of tubal occlusion.
Vasectomy – do not use clips for occluding the vas.
Irrigation of the vas during vasectomy.
Routine use of more than one Filshie clip.
Use of diathermy as the primary method of tubal occlusion.
Use of culdoscopy as a method of approach.

CHAPTER 67 Venous thromboembolism and hormonal contraception

Contraceptive efficacy
Prevalence and background
• VTE includes DVT, PE, and cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST).
• Background incidence of VTE in women of reproductive age is 50–100/100,000 woman–years.
This is 10-fold higher than the widely quoted absolute risks for women of reproductive age
who are not using contraception (5/100,000 woman–years).
• Non-RCTs suggest an increased risk of VTE with CHC use. The consistency of finding an
increased risk among COC users in most of these studies (20 or more) strongly suggests that
the effect is real.
• There is synergism between genetic factors associated with VTE (such as factor V Leiden
mutation, prothrombin 20210A, protein C or protein S deficiency, antithrombin III deficiency)
and acquired risk factors (such as APS, pregnancy, contraceptive use, surgery, trauma,
immobilization, and malignancy).
• Hormonal contraception:
* Combined hormonal contraceptive – pill (COCs), patch (CTP), and vaginal ring.
* Progestogen-only contraceptive – pills (POPs), implant (POIM), injectable (POIC), and the
LNG-IUS; progestogen-only emergency contraception (POEC).

• COC containing gestodene or desogestrel has a 2-fold increase in the risk of VTE
compared with NET or LNG (second-generation pills). Progestogen norgestimate is
metabolized to LNG and is considered to have a VTE risk similar to that of secondgeneration COCs.
• Data on VTE risk and CHC are based mainly on studies of oral methods; however,
the risk is considered to be the same for all HC methods regardless of the mode of
administration.
• COC users and the risk of VTE (Committee on Safety of Medicine data from 1999)
* Population
VTE/100,000 woman–years
Relative risk
* Non-pregnant non-users
5
* LNG or NET COC
15
3-fold increase
* Gestodene/desogestrel COC
25
5-fold increase
* Pregnant non-users
60
12-fold increase
• The RR of VTE increased with all CHCs. Nevertheless, the rarity of VTE in women of
reproductive age means that the absolute risk remains small.
• The RR of VTE increases in the first 4 months after initiating CHC. This risk reduces
with increasing duration of use but it remains above the background risk until the CHC
is stopped.
COCs

History and risk assessment
• For the majority of women, the use of HC is safe; however, some medical conditions can
contraindicate the use of particular methods. Take a detailed history to identify any conditions
that fall within the categories 3 or 4 for use of HC.
• As POCs do not increase the risk of VTE, most of the risk assessment relates to CHC.

Screening for thrombophilia before prescribing HC
• Do not routinely screen general population for thrombophilia prior to HC use. Most episodes
of VTE occur in women who do not have a thrombogenic mutation.
• Selective screening (based on the presence of personal or family history of VTE) is more
cost-effective than universal screening. However, selective screening prevents fewer clinical
adverse events (1/10,000) compared with universal screening (3/10,000) prior to HC use.

• Recent Europe-wide surveillance study (EURAS):
* A 2-fold increase in the RR of VTE with COC use compared with non-use.
* No difference in risk was identified between any brands of COC, regardless of the
progestogen (including those containing drospirenone).
* The absolute risk of VTE associated with COC use was 10-fold higher than those
quoted in the earlier CSM data, but this reflects the increase in the background risk.
• Intravaginal ring – the combined hormonal vaginal ring (2.7 mg EE and 11.7 mg
etonorgestrel) provides a serum concentration of EE of around 15 µg/day. Insufficient
data on the RRs of VTE compared with other combined methods.
• Cyproterone acetate-containing COC – COC containing cyproterone acetate with EE is
not licensed to be used solely as a contraceptive but it can provide contraception. There
is some evidence that it is associated with a 4-fold increase in the risk of VTE. Some of it
may be due to inherent cardiovascular risks of women (PCOS).
• Transdermal patch – long-term data on VTE risk with the combined EE and
norelgestromin transdermal patch are limited.
• EURAS – the incidence of VTE in patch users is 74/100,000 woman–years.
• The risk of VTE with patch use is slightly increased compared with that for a LNG
contraceptive (OR 1.4), but this is not statistically significant.
POCs

• Limited data. POCs are not associated with an increased risk of VTE.
• Systematic review (2009) – 4 case–control studies. 3 reported an increased risk and 1 a
decreased risk of VTE. The overall OR for POC-associated VTE was 1.45.
• No specific evidence was identified regarding the risk of VTE with the use of POIM, the
LNG-IUS, POEC, or desogestrel-only pill; but data are limited.

SECTION 8

Contraception

Conditions predisposing to VTE

Current or previous VTE

Family history

Known thrombogenic mutations

• CHC is contraindicated as this poses an
unacceptable health risk (UKMEC 4).
• POCs – benefits outweigh any risks (UKMEC 2).
• Women using anticoagulants – there is a small risk
of haematoma with POIM or POICs, but the risk
is small.
• The LNG-IUS can be used to manage menorrhagia
associated with anticoagulant use.

• A family history of VTE may indicate an increased risk
of VTE. Nevertheless, a family history alone cannot
identify an underlying thrombophilia with any certainty.
• CHC use by women with a family history of VTE
in a first-degree relative of < 45 years of age is not
recommended (UKMEC 3).
• POCs may be used regardless of family history.

• Women with reduced levels of naturally occurring anticoagulant
(anti-thrombin III, protein C, or protein S) or factor V Leiden
who use COCs have up to a 5-fold increase in the risk of VTE
compared with non-users without this deficiency.
• Women with factor V Leiden can have up to a 35-fold increase in
the risk of VTE with COC use.
• If a woman has an identified thrombogenic mutation, the use of
CHC poses an unacceptable health risk (UKMEC 4).
• POCs can be used without further increasing the risk of VTE.

Smoking

Obesity

• Do not use CHC in women aged > 35 years who are current smokers or who have
stopped smoking less than 1 year previously.
• Compared with non-smokers, light smokers (< 15 cigarettes/day) have a 2-fold increased
risk of MI and heavy smokers (> 15 cigarettes/day) have a 4-fold increased risk. Use of
CHC in heavy smokers appears to increase the risk 20-fold. VTE risk is increased with
the increasing amount smoked.
• The risks of stroke, MI, and VTE increase with increasing age, and mortality from
cigarette smoking increases from age 35 years. Advise smokers aged > 35 years against
the use of CHC (UKMEC 3 for women who smoke <15 cigarettes/day and UKMEC 4
for women smoking ≥ 15 cigarettes/day).
• Can use POCs in women who smoke.

• For women with a BMI ≥ of 35, the risks of CHC may outweigh the benefits.
• Obesity is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease and VTE.
• COC users who are obese have a 5–8-fold increased risk of VTE compared with non-users
and up to a 10-fold increase in risk compared with that of non-users who are not obese. The
absolute risk of VTE in women with increased BMI is still low.
• For women with obesity I (BMI 30.0–34.9), the benefits of using CHC generally outweigh
the risks (UKMEC 2).
• For women with obesity II (BMI 35.0–39.9) and obesity III (BMI 40 or more) the risks of
CHC may outweigh the benefits (UKMEC 3).
• Consider using CHCs with expert clinical judgement and/or referral if other methods are
unavailable or unacceptable.
• POCs can be used safely regardless of weight.

Post-pregnancy use

Surgery and other conditions leading to immobilization

• For women who are postpartum and not breastfeeding, do not initiate CHC before day
21 postpartum.
• In the first 3 weeks postpartum, coagulation and fibrinolytic factors have not returned to
their pre-pregnancy state and therefore the risk of VTE is still greater then in non-pregnant
women. In view of this, the risks of using CHC before day 21 postpartum outweigh the
benefits (UKMEC 3).
• From day 21 postpartum, the benefits of CHC use for women who are not breastfeeding
outweigh the risks (UKMEC 1).
• POCs can be started any time postpartum as they do not pose an increased risk.
• All HC can be safely initiated immediately following a first- or second-trimester TOP up
to 24 weeks of gestation.

• Discontinue CHC and start an alternative oestrogen-free method at least 4 weeks before
major elective surgery where immobilization is expected. CHC does not need to be
discontinued before minor surgery without immobilization.
• The benefits of using CHC outweigh the risks for women having minor surgery where
immobilization is not expected or for major surgery without prolonged immobilization.
• For women undergoing major elective surgery with prolonged immobilization, the use of
CHC poses an unacceptable health risk (UKMEC 4).
• POCs do not increase the risk of VTE and do not need to be discontinued before surgery.
• When the CHC has not been discontinued before surgery (e.g., in an emergency procedure),
follow thromboprophylaxis guidelines.

http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/CBO9781316156513.068

Conditions predisposing to VTE (contd.)

Sickle-cell disease

• SCD is a chronic, inherited, haematological condition that
can be complicated by vaso-occlusion by poorly deformable
erythrocytes. An observational study comparing hormonal
(combined and POCs) and barrier contraception in women
with SCD showed no significant difference in haemostatic
variables. A case–control study showed a reduction in
painful sickle-cell crises with use of DMPA.
• Benefits of using any type of HC in SCD outweigh the risks.
• Women with SCD with pulmonary HT – CHC is not
recommended.

Systemic lupus erythematosus

Other medical conditions

• Women with SLE are at an increased risk of heart disease,
stroke, and VTE. Nevertheless, very few women with SLE
will go on to develop VTE.
• Women with SLE and positive or unknown
antiphospholipid antibodies – CHC poses an unacceptable
health risk (UKMEC 4).
• POCs may be used in this situation based on individual
risks and with liaison between contraceptive and SLE
specialists (UKMEC 3).

• Women with IBS are not at increase risk of VTE. Offer the
same contraceptive choices as other women. In women
who are immobilized owing to disease exacerbation or
major surgery, stop CHC and provide an alternative
contraception.
• Women with varicose veins and superficial
thrombophlebitis are not at an increased risk of VTE and
can therefore use any hormonal methods (UKMEC 1).

Evidence round-up – individual VTE risk with COCs
• Systematic review of 25 studies (2012).
• The pooled RRs of VTE associated with the various CHCs, depending on their progestogen, were:
* Gestodene vs LNG 1.3.
* Desogestrel vs LNG 1.9.
* Drospirenone vs LNG 1.7.
• The pooled OR for:
* Norgestimate vs LNG 1.1.
* Cyproterone acetate vs LNG 1.7.
• Safest CHCs in terms of VTE are those containing LNG or norgestimate.
• Risk of VTE associated with desogestrel-, drospirenone-, or cyproterone acetate-containing CHCs
is greater than that associated with CHCs containing LNG.
• Increased risk of VTE found for CHCs with gestodene compared with LNG seems smaller than in
previous analyses.
• There were no differences in VTE risk between oral and transdermal CHCs containing
norgestimate or norelgestromin, respectively.

What not to do
•
•
•
•
•
•

Routine population screening for thrombophilia prior to HC.
CHC use in women with current VTE or previous VTE (UKMEC 4).
CHC use in woman with an identified thrombogenic mutation (UKMEC 4).
CHC use in women with SCD with pulmonary HT.
CHC use in women with SLE and positive or unknown APA antibodies (UKMEC 4).
CHC use in smokers who are aged > 35 years (UKMEC 3 for women who smoke < 15
cigarettes/day and UKMEC 4 for women smoking ≥ 15 cigarettes/day).
• CHC use in women undergoing major elective surgery with prolonged immobilization
(UKMEC 4).
